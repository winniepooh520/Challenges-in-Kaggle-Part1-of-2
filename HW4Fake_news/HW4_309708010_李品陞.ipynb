       "['Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  No one ever truly gets over losing a loved one, and Blake Shelton is no exception. He was just 14 when his older brother Richie died on Nov. 13, 1990. And, as Shelton noted in a tweet Monday, \"It changed my life forever.\"  Richie was 24 when he died in a car accident in the Sheltons\\' home state of Oklahoma. Two years ago, Shelton sent out a message for the 25th anniversary of his loss:  Richie, who was Blake\\'s half-brother (they shared a mother), was a passenger in a car that collided with a school bus in Ada, south of Oklahoma City.  Richie, driver Redena McManus and a 3-year-old boy, Christopher McManus, all died during or shortly after the collision, while the bus driver and passengers were uninjured, according to police reports.  The accident has clearly remained with Blake, who told 60 Minutes in 2014, \"I remember picking up the phone to call him a week after he was dead, to tell him something. I was picking up the phone to call him, to tell him something I just saw on TV or, and it was like constantly a shock to me that he was dead.\"  Blake Shelton playing at TODAY\\'s Halloween Extravaganza in New York City on Oct. 31. Getty Images  In 2011, Blake and his then-wife Miranda Lambert wrote a single called \"Over You,\" which was inspired by Richie.  Still, the two brothers had bonded despite the age difference; both shared a love of country music. \"His bedroom was right across the hallway from mine when I was little,\" Blake said in that interview. \"And he was listening to Hank Williams, Jr. or Waylon, Lynyrd Skynyrd or Bob Seeger. I just, whatever was popular really, Richie loved all music.  \"And I would be sitting there going, \\'Man, that guy\\'s my hero. That\\'s the coolest guy. He’s my big brother.\\'\"  Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter.',\n",

       " 'Much like a certain Amazon goddess with a lasso, there are no heights that director Patty Jenkins can’t scale. Her blockbuster “Wonder Woman,” which has grossed a staggering $821 million worldwide since it opened in the summer, has become a rallying call for women everywhere and a beacon of empowerment in a Donald Trump-led world. Beyond all the Instagram posts of little girls decked out in “WW” regalia while seeing the film and an endorsement from Hillary Clinton, Jenkins recently cracked another glass ceiling. She’ll be directing “Wonder Woman 2” for a reported $7 million to $9 million, a record salary for a female filmmaker.  As she negotiated the terms of her contract with Warner Bros. over several months, Jenkins was conscious of what earning a big paycheck would mean. “You’re of course aware of the money,” says Jenkins on a sunny afternoon in Los Angeles. “But I’ve never been more aware of a duty than I was in this deal. I was extremely aware that I had to make sure I was being paid what the male equivalent would be.”  CREDIT: Art Streiber for Variety  According to recent studies, women only earn roughly 80 cents to every dollar that men get. The pay gap is evident in all corners of society, even Hollywood, where A-list actresses such as Jennifer Lawrence and Charlize Theron have had to fight to be compensated the same as their male peers. But until now, there’s never been an A-list female director with as much clout as Jenkins. Other women behind big live-action tentpoles, such as Catherine Hardwicke (“Twilight”) and Sam Taylor-Johnson (“Fifty Shades of Grey”), didn’t return for second installments, and the studios quickly replaced them with male directors.  “Women who have not been in a system that allows them to build up the same level of pay as men are not able to be paid the same as men forever if that’s the way it continues,” Jenkins says. “You have to ask for it to happen, and you have to ask when you’re the appropriate person.” She points to Theron, who starred in her 2003 independent film “Monster” and won an Oscar for the role. “I knew when Charlize had to do it on ‘Snow White and the Huntsman,’ and I felt that it was my job to do it here.”  Gal Gadot, the star of “Wonder Woman,” was cheering Jenkins on. “She is definitely paving the way for so many other female directors,” Gadot says. “I think it was very important that she fought to get the best deal. You got to walk the walk and talk the talk.”  Despite the results of the presidential election and women’s marches throughout the country, Jenkins never imagined that “Wonder Woman” would touch such a nerve. “I didn’t really start to make the connection about the lightning rod it was going to hit until it had opened,” says Jenkins, who gets stopped by strangers who profess how much the movie has meant to them. “I assumed that it would be seen just as a superhero film.” She’s in awe of all the high-profile groupies that she’s collected along the way. “When you hear about people like Hillary Clinton or Dwayne Johnson talking about you in the press, it’s like, ‘What!’ It’s so crazy and lovely.”  Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot share a moment on the set of “Wonder Woman.”  Courtesy of Warner Bros/Clay Enos  As Wonder Woman has resurfaced as a cultural icon, Jenkins has been the brains behind the movement. “I’ve become more well-known than I ever thought I would,” Jenkins says. “I didn’t think I would be getting this much attention.” Acting as an ambassador for the disenfranchised is a responsibility that Jenkins doesn’t take lightly. “I think the legacy of ‘Wonder Woman’ is a different kind of hero, one that hits the same marks but also really is about love and empowerment in a slightly different way,” she says. “I think that’s why I love that people wear her outfit. People who are struggling in some sort of way or don’t identify with the world they live in can often find themselves in Wonder Woman.”  Although some critics have read “Wonder Woman” as a feminist manifesto — when our hero meets her love interest, Steve (Chris Pine), she keeps her clothes on, while he’s naked — Jenkins didn’t think about it in those terms. “Not at all,” she says. “And that is the success of feminism. I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you’re so feminist, you’re not thinking about it at all. Where you’re like, ‘Of course this superhero is the greatest superhero of all time. Oh, she’s a woman? I wasn’t even thinking about that!’”  Not everybody has been a fan of “Wonder Woman.” After James Cameron publicly bashed the movie with a misogynistic shrug, Jenkins shot back with her own statement on social media. “I actually was not upset at all,” Jenkins says. “Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But if you’re going to debate something in a public way, I have to reply that I think it’s incorrect.” Did Cameron ever reach out to apologize? “No,” she says.  Jenkins worked in Hollywood as a focus puller and a camera operator in her 20s. She was among the small group of women doing a man’s job, but she wasn’t so aware of it. “I never thought about the fact that I was the only woman,” she says. Even so, she thinks it’s important to mentor other women as they try to climb the industry ladder. “I definitely do,” says Jenkins. “But also, I feel a real obligation to be open to help everyone. I really think that ‘Wonder Woman’ is a loving character to all.”  There’s been a lot of talk about why 14 years elapsed between her first film and “Wonder Woman.” Jenkins says that it was mostly her decision, because she wanted to be at home at night with her son and her husband. And it’s not as if she wasn’t working. She took on TV projects like directing the pilot of “The Killing.” “When you have a little baby, directing a feature where you’re gone every few years is not the easiest thing to sync up,” Jenkins says. “I know people who have done it. It wasn’t something I chose to do.”  I have always wanted to be last-wave feminism, where you’re so feminist, you’re not thinking about it at all.”  PATTY JENKINS  All the speculation about her career is understandable. The industry still has a dismal record when hiring women directors in the movies: Only 7% of the top 250 films of 2016 were directed by women, and that number gets smaller when you look at blockbusters. Next spring, Disney will release Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” which has a budget north of $100 million. But the list of directors attached to the “Star Wars” franchise is all-male, even with a female producer (Kathleen Kennedy) in charge. “It would depend on the project,” Jenkins says when asked if she’d want to direct a “Star Wars” movie.  In the Oscars race, not a single woman director has been nominated since Kathryn Bigelow became the first to win in the category in 2010. Warner Bros. is campaigning Jenkins as part of a robust Oscar push for “Wonder Woman” — if she’s nominated, she’ll be the first director of a comic-book movie to be recognized. “There’s no reason why they shouldn’t be considered,” she says of the Academy embracing comic-book adaptations. At least there’s been some progress: This is the first time in recent memory that there’s more than one woman — including Dee Rees (“Mudbound”) and Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”) — with a real chance of being nominated for best director.  Jenkins was able to negotiate her groundbreaking deal with Warner Bros. because the studio didn’t lock her down to multiple chapters. She had been in talks for “Wonder Woman,” but the studio offered the job to another filmmaker. After Michelle MacLaren exited due to creative differences, Jenkins signed on, without committing to a sequel. “They could have tied me up earlier,” she says. “I wouldn’t have wanted that.” Even though she wasn’t on board for a second movie, she kept envisioning it while making the first. (She’s been working on a treatment with DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns.) “I think she has a really clear and fun and compelling place that she’s taking the story,” says Warner Bros. Pictures Group chief Toby Emmerich.  Jenkins directs a scene in the 2003 film “Monster.” Charlize Theron, who played serial killer Aileen Wuornos, won an Oscar for the lead role.  Snap Stills/REX/Shutterstock  One of the mantras associated with Wonder Woman — “Life is tough but so am I” — could easily apply to Jenkins’ own upbringing. Her father, William T. Jenkins, was an Air Force captain. He fought in Vietnam and later ran maneuvers out of a military base in England; his family joined him on all his adventures overseas. In interviews, Jenkins has talked a lot about how the heroism of her dad shaped “Wonder Woman.” She even has a dedication to him in the film’s closing credits.  But what she doesn’t talk about much is that he died, at 31, when she was only 7. “He passed away after taking off from a runway exactly like the one that Steve takes off on,” Jenkins says, referring to Wonder Woman’s boyfriend. “He crashed in the ocean.” She’s still not sure exactly what happened. “Nobody knows. He was in the middle of a NATO mock dogfight. They crash a lot. You’re doing a tricky maneuver.”  Her father’s spirit was on the “Wonder Woman” set, even if she didn’t always reference him directly. Gadot says she thought of Jenkins’ dad when she saw the film for the first time, especially during the climactic scene where Steve makes the ultimate sacrifice for the woman he loves. “I think that even in the short time that he was present in her life, he had a lot of effect on who she became,” Gadot says.  The death of her father framed Jenkins’ outlook in many ways. “It’s part of why I think I wanted to make movies,” she says. “I wanted to experience wonder somewhere. I didn’t think I would experience it in real life.”  A few months after her dad passed away, Jenkins remembers a cross-country road trip from Kansas to San Francisco in a VW bug. “My mom” — who would put herself through school to become an environmental scientist — “dropped my sister and I at the movie theater to wait out this snowstorm,” Jenkins says. They watched the original “Superman,” starring Christopher Reeve. “I remember everything about the experience of seeing it,” Jenkins says. “It really hit me in that way of exactly what I think superheroes were designed to do — to inspire you to metaphorically imagine the superhero within.”  That movie gave a grieving young girl some hope. It also provided her with a clear goal. “Seriously, that’s the part I can’t believe,” Jenkins says. “I always thought, because of ‘Superman,’ one day I want to make a movie that makes other people feel like that movie made me feel. The fact that that’s come true is so stunning.”  Watch a behind-the-scenes video of Jenkins’ Power of Women L.A. cover shoot.',\n",

       " \"When Reese Witherspoon was 17, she had already appeared in four films. Still, she took an unlikely part-time job, as an intern in Disney’s post-production department. “I wanted to learn about editing, visual correction, and sound mixing,” she tells me 25 years later. Not long after, she worked as a production assistant on the 1995 Denzel Washington film Devil in a Blue Dress, helping with casting, among other things. Also: “I parked Denzel’s Porsche!”  advertisement  advertisement  That inquisitiveness, as well as nearly three decades in front of the camera, has made Witherspoon one of Hollywood’s most astute producers. She turned Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl into a $369 million worldwide hit in 2014 (that earned Rosamund Pike an Oscar nomination) and did it again, that same year, transforming Cheryl Strayed’s best-selling memoir, Wild, into a breakout success ($52 million plus Oscar nods for Witherspoon and costar Laura Dern). Then came HBO’s Big Little Lies, executive produced with costar Nicole Kidman; the cultural bellwether about female relationships and domestic abuse, based on a novel by Liane Moriarty, swept nearly every category for which it was nominated at the 2017 Emmys. After years of hearing from studio executives that there was no market for female-driven films, Witherspoon had succeeded to a degree that proved a hunger was there. Related: See The 100 Most Creative People In Business 2018 Her instinct for what women want is now being tested on multiple platforms through her 18-month-old storytelling company, Hello Sunshine. She and her team currently have shows in development at Hulu, NBC, and Apple TV (which has partnered on three projects, one rumored to be the biggest deal in history for a straight-to-series show), as well as a film at TriStar/Sony Pictures. But Witherspoon is also laying the foundation for a direct-to-consumer brand, one that is already beginning to speak to women through a website, social media, YouTube and Facebook videos, audiobooks, podcasts, and newsletters—whichever platform she and Hello Sunshine execs think best honors the story being told. For all the company’s digital ambition, Hello Sunshine’s Santa Monica, California, headquarters have an old-fashioned feel. The loft-like interior, with exposed wooden beams and pipes, is cheerfully decorated by Crate & Barrel (Witherspoon collaborates with the retailer). Vintage typewriters and hundreds of books make plain the company’s abiding passions: stories and the people who tell them. Sheets of paper with typewritten words to live by, tacked to a wall, gently rustle every time the front door opens. “I hope that you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there,” reads one, a line from Nora Ephron’s 1996 commencement address at Wellesley College. “And I also hope you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women.” Fluorescent signs at the back of the room illuminate a five-word ethos: optimism, humor, curiosity, honesty, generosity. The space—which doubles as a set for interviews—is recognizable from videos on the Hello Sunshine website. Witherspoon’s glassed-in office is within shouting distance of her coworkers, who on a late March day sit or stand at a handful of desks or read books in armchairs. Witherspoon is wearing a navy blazer and a blue shirt with white hearts, both from Draper James, the apparel and housewares brand she launched online in 2015 as a “hey y’all!” celebration of her down-home roots. Her look is feminine, but not precious. Or, as her friend Kerry Washington describes it, “genteel Southern badass.” Witherspoon, in person, bears a distracting similitude to Elle Woods, the character she made famous with 2001’s Legally Blonde. Celeste Ng, whose novel Little Fires Everywhere is being adapted by Hello Sunshine for Hulu, had a similar first reaction: “She’s bubbly and perky and scarily smart. I thought, Oh my god, it’s Elle Woods! But there’s a kinship with [Election‘s] Tracy Flick, too, in that people who underestimate her learn their mistake really fast.”  advertisement  Wherever Witherspoon goes—Asia, Europe, Africa, South America—she is stopped by Legally Blonde fans: “I went to law school because of you,” they’ll say, or, “You helped me believe in myself.” She gets teary talking about the film’s impact. “I didn’t even understand when I was making it that it was a bit of a modern feminist manifesto,” she says. “Seeing a woman who is interested in feminine attitudes—getting her nails done—but who is also interested in promoting herself and accomplishing things was a new idea of feminine. A lot of women related to that, and the feeling of being underestimated.” Related video: Our all-female crew talks women in Hollywood with Reese Witherspoon Cynics might wonder if Witherspoon’s production company was merely designed to capitalize on #MeToo’s momentum. But Hello Sunshine was founded in November 2016, nearly a year before the flood of 60-plus allegations against veteran Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein exposed just how endemic and toxic the industry’s gender imbalance has been. The outpouring of firsthand accounts of sexual abuse from fellow actors encouraged Witherspoon to reveal her own multiple experiences of harassment and assault, including by a director when she was just 16. She was among the Hollywood women who organized the all-black dress code for the Golden Globes this past January as part of the Time’s Up movement. This look is totally Madeline Mackenzie! @reesewitherspoon is in Monterey and brought along the Draper James Elliston Floral Skirt — link in bio to shop ???? A post shared by Draper James (@draperjames) on Apr 14, 2018 at 11:09am PDT “Part of me is incredulous,” says Witherspoon of Hollywood’s quick pivot to addressing gender disparity. “I can’t believe people are actually listening now. It’s also a relief,” she adds with a laugh, “not to have to spend the first 15 minutes of every meeting talking about the lack of content for women. Now it’s, ‘Yeah, got it.’ ” At the same time, she says, “a lot of us are having to step up into leadership positions that we didn’t know we were capable of. I definitely feel that in my life.” Putting more women on screen is a Hello Sunshine mandate. But surfacing the voices of real—and diverse—women is the company’s true mission. There are many female-focused production companies, and several successful digital brands that produce social content directed at women, but no entity has yet tried to do what Witherspoon is attempting: to build a premium independent film and TV studio within a direct-to-consumer, female-led brand that operates on multiple platforms. “Fortunately,” Witherspoon says, “I like proving people wrong.” Hello Sunshine is Witherspoon’s third production company. At 25, she had an office and five employees to develop movies for Universal Studios. She called it Type A Films. “I had no idea what I was doing,” she says. “In four years I produced one film, Penelope, with Christina Ricci. It was beautiful, and I loved it, but it was clear to me that I wasn’t ready to tell stories—because I didn’t know what stories I wanted to tell.”  advertisement  As she aged, substantial roles became harder to come by. “It was getting laughable how bad the parts were, particularly for women over 35,” says Witherspoon. “And that, of course, is when you become really interesting as a woman.” Suddenly, there were stories she wanted to tell. Witherspoon thought about partnering again with a studio to develop films. Her husband, Jim Toth, dissuaded her. Toth is a motion picture talent agent at Creative Artists Agency, and it was apparent to him that his wife was good at reading the zeitgeist and spotting promising authors. Toth told her, “‘Babe, do it yourself,'” Witherspoon recalls. “‘You read more books than anyone I know. You know what works as well as anyone.'” She also wanted to “further the evolution of women’s roles,” she says, and they both knew that partnering with a studio would mean satisfying a corporate mandate. “I’d be making products they like,” she says. Witherspoon joined forces in 2012 with another producer, Bruna Papandrea. They created a company called Pacific Standard, which went on to adapt two of that year’s hottest book properties, Crown Publishing Group’s Gone Girl and Alfred A. Knopf’s Wild (Strayed had personally sent an advance copy directly to Witherspoon in November 2011). Around the time that they were developing Big Little Lies, in 2014, Witherspoon began noting changes in consumer behavior. “Women weren’t going to movies,” she says. “They were streaming shows. They were on Instagram and Facebook. Digital was winning. The only way was to go where women are, instead of expecting them to come to us in theaters.” The digital imperative was underscored by her three children—Ava, 18, and Deacon, 14 (with first husband, actor Ryan Phillippe), and 5-year-old Tennessee (with Toth, whom she married in March 2011). For them, YouTube and streaming had replaced watching network TV and going to the movies. Rather than moaning like so many in the industry about the tyranny of tiny screens, Witherspoon became excited by the creative potential of digital platforms and the relationships forged on social media. She joined Instagram in 2013 and started to build an audience (12.8 million followers to date). Draper James—which now has four brick-and-mortar stores—allowed her to become involved with consumers in a more intimate way. “I’d never had that before. I was always behind a screen. And I’m an extrovert,” adds Witherspoon, who remains creative director and the face of the retail company. Witherspoon’s second-ever Instagram post, in May 2013, was about J. Courtney Sullivan’s novel The Engagements (“I love this book! Has anyone else read?”). It got a big-enough reaction that other book recommendations followed. News she posted about Pacific Standard’s coming adaptations of Gone Girl and Wild gave both novels sales bumps. According to Amazon Books, Gone Girl sales tripled following the release of the first movie trailer, then doubled during the opening weekend. Witherspoon learned that she could personally build audiences for movies long before they were released. At the same time, she was also loving the conversations she was having with other women about literature. After starting an informal Instagram-led book club in 2015, Witherspoon grew even more interested in digital community  building. Papandrea preferred to stick with film and TV. The pair decided to dissolve Pacific Standard (though they continue to partner on Big Little Lies; season 2 is due in 2019), and Witherspoon began to think about who might help her build a consumer-facing brand.  advertisement  If Witherspoon is the soul of Hello Sunshine, then CEO Sarah Harden, a fast-talking Australian, is the heart of the place, pumping life into the operation daily. I meet her in the company’s second office, in Beverly Hills, where the film and TV brainstorming happens. Harden and Witherspoon met through Peter Chernin, who was head of 20th Century Fox when the studio produced 2005’s Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, for which Witherspoon won a Best Actress Oscar. When Chernin left the company, Witherspoon followed his career. “He is very smart,” she says, “and a good prognosticator.” Chernin had gone on to found his own media company, the Chernin Group, and launch (with AT&T) a subsidiary called Otter Media, dedicated to acquiring and building media brands for niche audiences. One of them, Crunchyroll, is now the largest global distributor of anime. The executive overseeing Otter’s acquisitions was Harden, who watched digital media studio Rooster Teeth turn itself into an online mecca for gamers. “Sixty thousand people go to [the Rooster Teeth] convention in Austin every summer,” Harden says. “I said, ‘We’ve got to find a female equivalent.’ ” She spent four years looking at existing female-driven brands. Most “were beauty- and fashion-focused, publishing-focused. They weren’t video storytelling at their core. And video is expensive,” she adds. “It takes incisive understanding to build full-scale, profitable businesses around that, and it requires creating a brand people love.” Witherspoon first brought her idea for Hello Sunshine to Chernin in the summer of 2016. One of her criteria: “I needed to have a woman run the company,” she says. Chernin introduced her to Harden, and by November, Otter Media was Hello Sunshine’s only external seed investor (for an amount in the “single-digit millions,” says Harden), joining Witherspoon, Toth, and investor Seth Rodsky, who was Witherspoon’s partner in founding Draper James. The investment “had nothing to do with Reese being a movie star,” says Chernin. “She’s a great entrepreneur because of her willpower. And she had a remarkably clear idea of what she wanted to build.” He also saw a potentially lucrative white space for an underserved audience. Unlike the millennial- and coastal-focused brands that dominate the digital landscape, Witherspoon is targeting literate women across America, spanning a strikingly wide age range of 20 to 60. Hello Sunshine now has 19 employees, with 20 more likely to join by year’s end—a workforce that, yes, includes men. It’s important, Witherspoon says, that men “feel they have an opportunity to create a new reality for the world too.” Underlying everything, says Harden, is books. Witherspoon’s book club picks—and, yes, she chooses each one (helpfully, she reads fast)—were an easy way to establish the company’s tone. One of Harden’s first moves after taking the helm of the company last June was to turn each selection into a monthly event, supported by video interviews with authors (usually conducted by Witherspoon), social posts on, say, a book’s inspiration, and giveaways—all in the service of community building. Maintaining levity is important, says Harden: “You can go to earnest places very quickly, and Reese will say, ‘This is not funny! Nothing about this is funny!’ ”  advertisement  Reese’s Book Club x Hello Sunshine, which counts upwards of 460,000 followers on Instagram, hasn’t reached Oprah book club heights (more than a million followers), but Hello Sunshine is already considered by the publishing industry to be a powerful marketing force. Two of her selections have been HarperCollins titles: Kate Quinn’s The Alice Network and Balli Kaur Jaswal’s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows. “With both novels, we saw significant upticks, not just in sales but in distribution,” says Jennifer Hart, a marketing executive at the publishing company, who is particularly optimistic about a recently launched Hello Sunshine newsletter. Witherspoon is world-famous, deep-pocketed, and married to a top agent at a leading Hollywood agency (where she is also a client). It’s tempting for people to attribute her success as a producer to her undeniable advantage. But Witherspoon’s pipeline to the book world is authentic and robust. Since posting her first book recommendation five years ago, she has relied on her taste and instinct to predict, again and again, which titles will resonate with her audience, and that has encouraged the book world to court her attention. The Alice Network became a New York Times bestseller six months after Witherspoon selected it for her book club. HarperCollins even timed the release of last March’s Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows—”which wasn’t on anyone’s radar as a big book,” says Hart—to coincide with the Hello Sunshine pick. “I don’t think there’s anyone out there who is as much of an advocate for female authors, and for pushing out new, diverse voices,” says Hart. Little Fires Everywhere was months from publication when Witherspoon first read it, and she chose it for her book club last September, before it became a monster best seller. Like Big Little Lies, the novel is rich with conversation starters—in this case, adoption, parenting, race, and class. Witherspoon had been looking for a series to coproduce with Kerry Washington, and the minute she finished Little Fires, she emailed the actress. “The message was, ‘I’ve found our project!’ ” says Washington, who was shooting Scandal at the time. “I finished it in 72 hours. I literally locked myself in a bathroom.” Hulu won the bidding war and is developing the series. @reesewitherspoon and @kerrywashington are on ???????????? with some MAJOR news. ???? our Stories or tap the link in bio to see what they’ve been up to! #LittleFiresEverywhere @pronounced_ing A post shared by Hello Sunshine (@hellosunshine) on Mar 2, 2018 at 10:11am PST Hello Sunshine’s newest venture is a multiyear partnership with Audible, the world’s largest producer of audiobooks, which will allow anyone to access the audio versions of Witherspoon’s monthly book club picks. Don Katz, the founder of the company, now owned by Amazon, had lunch with Witherspoon in May 2017 (they were both speaking at the Milken Conference) and “one thing led to another,” he says. A separate but related deal, Audible Originals x Hello Sunshine, will enable Witherspoon’s company to commission new audio-first or audio-exclusive works from authors, playwrights, and TV writers. “Reese is focused on talent—actors and writers—who [are] underemployed for various reasons,” says Katz, “and she’s aware of an audience that is similarly underserved. All of those people come with her.” Chernin says that Hello Sunshine’s biggest challenge now is growing its daily engagement, and Harden and Witherspoon know that one key to this will be maintaining Hello Sunshine’s positive, pro-women voice. Witherspoon has been remarkably savvy in the way she communicates with her audience. But as Lena Dunham, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Tony Robbins might attest, too much honesty can be perilous when you are running a personal brand. A single tone-deaf comment, awkwardly phrased joke, or attempt at “making a little trouble” as Nora Ephron suggests, could derail your entire business. But Witherspoon’s wit and straightforwardness are what her fans love about her. If she plays it too safe, she risks losing them, too.  advertisement  Witherspoon needs to walk off a sciatica flare-up, a recent development, so we stroll from the Santa Monica office to a nearby grocery and café. Witherspoon, who grew up in Nashville, talks about having two doctors as parents—her father is a retired otolaryngologist and her mother has a PhD in pediatric nursing. “My dad, every day he read medical journals and historical novels. If you didn’t have something interesting to say at the dinner table, it was because you weren’t doing any research or you weren’t a curious person,” she says. “He’s not a people person,” she adds. “I get that from my mom.” Asked about her career role models, she thinks for a few moments. “Goldie Hawn,” she says finally. “When she saw studios weren’t making parts for her, she knew her audience and would create a film based on what she knew they wanted to see—Private Benjamin, or Wildcats. Also Dolly Parton, who told me she did her best work partnering with women.” The old trope of the competitive female coworker, will, in Witherspoon’s opinion, disappear as jobs for them increase. “There’s real power in partnership, and I don’t think we have the ego thing as much.” HBO’s chairman and CEO, Richard Plepler, says that when Witherspoon learned that Nicole Kidman was also interested in optioning Big Little Lies, Witherspoon and Papandrea got in touch with Kidman and suggested that they join forces. “I love that about Reese,” says Plepler. “There’s room for everyone at the table.” For Witherspoon, partnering with Kidman has proved to be what she calls a “one plus one equals five” strategy: “People see the show’s success, that it makes a lot of money for the company, and that will create another show like that.” It’s playing out faster than she could have imagined. Casey Bloys, HBO’s president of programming, admitted in April that the network’s recent equal-pay push (e.g., Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood will earn as much as her male costars starting with season 3) was a “direct result” of the Time’s Up movement and encouragement he received from Witherspoon. Witherspoon and Kidman, meanwhile, will each take more than $500,000 per episode for season 2 of Big Little Lies. While crunching on avocado oil potato chips at the café, Witherspoon tells me about an exercise she does with her family, on the rare occasions when they watch TV together. A commercial will come on—such as a recent Adidas ad featuring athletes, models, and DJs sitting around a table, talking about what’s cool—and when it’s over, she’ll press pause and ask, “What did you see?” In this instance, “they said they saw a mix of people who were interesting and creative. And I said, ‘You know what I see? Three women and 13 men at the table. That’s what I see.’ ” Invariably, during these exercises, her family will ask her to roll the commercial back to check her math, and she’s usually pretty close. “Now my husband sees it all the time,” she says. “You just have to ask yourself, What am I not seeing?”  advertisement  One of the projects in development at Hello Sunshine is a film version of Karin Tanabe’s The Gilded Years, which will be released by TriStar/Sony Pictures next year. The 2016 novel reimagines the true story of the first black graduate of Vassar, in 1897, who was light-skinned enough to pass for white. Witherspoon fast-tracked a bidding war by preemptively casting the immensely popular former Disney star and pop singer Zendaya, who will also coproduce. For the adaptation, called A White Lie, she hired veteran TV screenwriter and producer Monica Beletsky (Fargo, Parenthood) because Beletsky had an idea for how to turn the period piece—always a hard sell with studios and audiences—into a thriller. Beletsky says she’s never before experienced the level of support she received from Hello Sunshine. “It can’t be overstated how rare it is to find producers who so quickly take a risk on an original idea, who are able to see the same film in their head that I see in mine,” she says. In her experience, producers don’t prep much before pitching movies to studios—”maybe a phone call the day before,” she says. But prior to her first meeting with potential buyers for A White Lie, Hello Sunshine had her workshop the pitch in front of different groups of employees. “I kid them that I felt like I’d been trained for the movie-storytelling Olympics.” The pitches are multimedia productions: Beletsky described her script in front of images from the period; as she talked about a scene, the real places would appear behind her. She’s half black and half Jewish, so she spent some time talking about identity; Zendaya spoke of “colorism” and how she connected to the material. At the end of one meeting, a potential buyer said, “Well, the good news is that we’re living in a world where people are more open-minded,” recalls Lauren Neustadter, Hello Sunshine’s head of TV and film development. Witherspoon was dismayed by the comment, Neustadter says, and on the way back to the office Witherspoon asked her assistant to find current photos of the boards of various big corporations, as well as members of Congress. They offered a stark finale to the team’s second pitch meeting, one that emphasized how little has actually changed—the very reason the film needs to be made. “Reese got very emotional,” remembers Neustadter, “and she said to the room, ‘We wish that we lived in a world where that was different.’ ” She was essentially asking studio execs what she asks of her family: What are you not seeing? It’s a question she hopes every Hello Sunshine project will answer. Reese Witherspoon is No. 11 on the 2018 Most Creative People in Business list.

The newlyweds tied the knot during a romantic beachside wedding in Curacao on Sunday, May 14, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.  The Atlanta Falcons linebacker, 32, and reality star exchanged vows at sunset before some 100 guests.  “I really wanted to pick a place that no one I knew had been before … so it would be an experience not just for me and Phil, but for everyone,” Roberts told Us of the location ahead of their big day. “The island is close to Aruba, but closer to Venezuela and South America and it’s only a two-hour flight from Miami. It was perfect.”  The bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.  “I wanted to be able to dance the night away,” Roberts told Us.  Their beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.  “Everything is very formal beach glamour, it’s a beach wedding, but still very glam,” Roberts told Us of her vision. “Lots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.”  The couple got engaged during a November 2016 episode of the hit E! show.

       " 'On March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, student-led pro-gun control “March For Our Lives” demonstrations took place across America, including in Washington, D.C.The word “Our” in March For Our Lives refers to students.From Wikipedia:March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your are requesting additional information reference this event, please follow the below steps to file your Freedom of Information Act request: https://foia-dc.gov/App/Index.aspx If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly. Officer Scott C. Earhardt, Badge No. 2372 Homeland Security BureauSpecial Operations DivisionPlanning and LogisticsMetropolitan Police Department2850 New York Ave., N.E.Washington, D.C. 20002202-671-6529 (Office)202-671-6522 (Planning)202-671-6511 (Station) Scott.Earhardt@dc.govBelow is a screenshot of the email (source: Professor James Fetzer):According to the PDF document, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C., Scott Earhardt indeed is a detective there. Here’s a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document:Here are some facts:The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “ several months prior to the actual event”.Questions:How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?See also:UPDATE (March 31, 2018):There are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that there’s a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to the National Park Service, not Metro PD. See “The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application“.I, therefore, asked Professor James Fetzer for the original Earhardt email. Fetzer had obtained the screenshot of the email from Ole Dammegard, whose friend was the person who originally contacted Officer Earhardt about the permit.I just received an email from Mr. Dammegard, with an attachment of the original Earhardt email, indicating the date on which the email was sent to Dammegard’s friend who, understandably, prefers to remain anonymous.I find the above email from Officer Earhardt to be credible. I also have confidence in the integrity of Professor Fetzer and Mr. Dammegard, neither of whom profits from counterfeiting the email — which is something we can’t say about those people who instigate false-flag mass-shooting incidents like Parkland.In the meantime, Professor Fetzer had placed a phone call to Officer Earhardt to confirm the latter’s email. When we hear from Officer Earhardt, I will update this post with that information.Update (April 5, 2018):Officer Earhardt has given 4 different dates for when Metro PD received the permit application.

       " 'A mosque in Georgia is under fire after they solicited donations allegedly for victims of Hurricane Harvey but decided to keep them and send them to a different kind of refugee instead.“Because Donald Trump will not let victims of war and crime seek solitude in the United States, we can not in good conscience help his people when so many Muslims can not find shelter,” said Imam Sharaj Alkalb of the Ramazala Mosque in Peachton. “Allah has told us that we must consider where the need is greater and respond to it.”The mosque recently made headlines for its “Good work” in the community.

       " 'Not so fast. Despite reports, a source tells Us Weekly that Angelina Jolie is not off the market.  “Angie isn’t dating a real estate agent. She isn’t even dating at the moment,” the insider reveals. “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key.”  The Salt actress, 42, and estranged husband Brad Pitt officially called it quits in September 2016 after more than 10 years together and two years of marriage. They are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.  “The divorce talks between Brad and Angie are ongoing,” the source adds, noting that Pitt, 54, is lonesome for their children, who live with their mom. “Brad wishes the kids would spend overnights at his house, but he is hopeful that over time, that will organically happen.”  The Tomb Raider star and Pitt much of their marriage on the move, raising their family in various cities. But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. “Angie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,” the source says. “Yes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It’s best for the kids that they aren’t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn’t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.”  Jolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the First They Killed My Father director admitted. “It’s not something I wanted. There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”  Although Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. “Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,” she disclosed. “Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!',\n",
       " 'Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s custody arrangement was put in place with the best interest of their kids in mind. However, it appears the “Fury” actor is more thrilled about the perks that will come along with the new agreement.  Pitt, who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9, with Jolie, is reportedly excited about being able to spend more time with his children following the previous arrangement, which damaged their relationship.  “Brad was always an amazing dad. The kids have always been his life. He has flaws like most people, but so does Angie,” a source told People.  “Brad must be so relieved that the court is now helping him,” the insider added.  Photo: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images  In Pitt and Jolie’s previous custody agreement, there wasn’t “a set schedule” and the arrangement was “unorganized,” according to those close to the stars.  However, the court has since ordered Jolie to allow the actor to repair his relationship with his children and has implemented a detailed schedule that divides custody between the parents.  While the younger children are required to abide by the current arrangement in place, the courts consider Jolie and Pitt’s 16-year-old son old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father. Even if Maddox opts not to spend much time with Pitt, seeing the other kids will be a relief for the actor.  “It’s been obvious that he has been missing his kids like crazy,” a source said. “To live so close to them, but not seeing them often, has definitely been painful for him.”  In the summer months, Pitt is expected to divide his time between Los Angeles, where he will film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and London, where Jolie is filming “Maleficent 2.”  Almost two years after Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, Pitt reportedly began “casually dating” and was most recently linked to MIT Professor Neri Oxman.  In May, sources told Us Weekly Pitt planned to cut down quality time with his rumored girlfriend in order to stay in Los Angeles and give his children his undivided attention.  “Their busy schedules are going to be a huge challenge because Neri isn’t going to give up her life in Cambridge or her job at MIT for anyone, even Brad Pitt,” the insider said.  While the actor hasn’t confirmed the romance, it appears he has decided to spend the majority of his free time with his children over the summer.  Photo: Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Brad Pitt may be finding love again, but a source close to him EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that the actor doubts the ‘right guy’ exists for Angelina Jolie. Ouch!  After causing everyone who still believed in true love to shudder collectively after hearing that the two of them were breaking up, Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, still don’t seem to be on the friendliest of terms after their split. A source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Brad doesn’t think a long-lasting love is in the cards for Angelina. “Brad is doubtful Angelina can have a successful marriage after theirs failed. Brad knows first hand how incredibly unique and challenging it is being in Angelina’s family. Brad gave it everything he had and is disappointed they could not stay together,” our source says.  Brad is currently rumored to be dating actress Ella Purnell, 21, but he still has a lot of respect for his ex. The source went on to say, “It is difficult dealing with the media, the fame, career, traveling and everything else that goes with being one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Brad knows what a dedicated mother Angelina is and how hard that can be for even the strongest men to deal with in a relationship.”  We reported earlier about how Angelina invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with their kids, but that Brad wasn’t “having it” with the prospect of any hangout with his ex. Our source added, “Brad understands that the best, most healthy and lasting relationships need lots of compromise so whoever has a shot at marrying Angelina will need to give up a lot to fit into her challenging lifestyle. Brad feels that while he wishes her the best, after several failed marriages for Angelina, the right guy for her might not exist.” While you muse on whether true love exists or not, check out pics of the celebrity couples who had downright painful breakups.

       " 'Brad Pitt.  Noted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single — and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes. So it should come as no surprise that sometimes the baggy-pants aficionado chooses to go incognito with the ladies by using a different name. Or should we say, his real name.  As Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn’t you know, according to “Page Six,” dear ol’ Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.  Pitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing “sunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket” (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who “looked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn’t her.” Per “Page Six”:  When the woman said, “I’m Lydia,” Pitt “put out his hand and said, ‘Hi, I’m William.’ She replied, ‘Oh, you look like a Bradley.’ And he responded, ‘Well, that’s my middle name’ and smiled and winked at her.”  As Lydia exited she said, “‘Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.’ He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.”  Sounds a lot like another William we know.',\n",

       " 'If you always wanted to go shoe shopping with Sarah Jessica Parker (and who doesn’t?), you’re out of luck. The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.  The $400 price tag for the “Sole in the City with SJP” experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale’s, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.  “What better way to meet than at Bloomingdale’s 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,” Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. “I’ll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I’ll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it. Next we’ll head to Forty Carrots for what some may say is the best frozen yogurt in NYC and we’ll chat about my city and why I’ve called it home for so many years. After that, I’ll send you off in your new SJP shoes to a special evening at the exquisite and incomparable New York City Ballet. You’ll have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises. It’ll be a night you won’t soon forget.”  Considering a pair of her shoes retail for between $295-$545 alone, this is actually a great deal! The bad news is there were only four spots available and they’re already booked. The good news that all proceeds from the experience go to help fund the New York City Ballet.  Going shoe shopping with a celebrity while giving back to the arts is something Stylish can totally get behind. Fingers crossed SJP does more of these in the future!

       " 'It’s only week 3, but the drama has already begun on Dancing with the Stars.  After Tom Bergeron opened guilty pleasures night by dedicating the show to those affected by the Las Vegas shooting, cohost Erin Andrews informed the audience that pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy wouldn’t be taking the stage Monday.  “Maks is dealing with a personal issue so Alan is stepping in and dancing with Vanessa tonight,” she said, referring to pro Alan Bersten, who got eliminated last week with partner Debbie Gibson.  Craig Sjodin via Getty  However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.  “There’s a big chemistry issue,” the insider says. “They both have big personalities and that’s not always the best recipe for a good partnership.”  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now.  While the former Total Request Live host, 36, has called the Ukrainian dancer the “best coach,” the source adds, “They’ve been fighting a lot.” (Reps for Chmerkovskiy and Lachey could not immediately be reached for comment.)  This isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy, 37, has butted heads with his DWTS celebrity counterparts. In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, “That’s literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.”  On the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.  “I feel that I can really be myself with Maks,” she told PEOPLE in 2014. “He pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it’s in real life or on the dance floor. It’s cool.”  He added at the time, “She lets me be creative. I’ve already done more on this season than I’ve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.”  RELATED VIDEO: Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Welcome Son Shai Aleksander  Andrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. ““The reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I’m like a guy in a lot of ways,” the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.  When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could’ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: “I wouldn’t be surprised if Maks doesn’t return as her partner for the rest of the season.”  However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.  Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.',\n",
       " 'In his upcoming book \\'The Kardashians: An American Drama,\\' Jerry Oppenheimer takes a closer look at two of the longest-circulating rumors about the Kardashian family.  First is the claim that Kris Jenner had an affair with her husband\\'s best friend Orenthal James Simpson, which appears to have first emerged after Kris split with fiancé Cesar Sanudo.  The second concerns the paternity of Kris\\' third child Khloe, who multiple sources close to the family believe was not the daughter of Robert.  That first claim still lacks any definitive proof or solid evidence the book reveals, while Oppenheimer speaks to a number of people who lend credence to the second claim by recounting conversations they had with Robert.  This latest work by the New York Times bestselling author will be released by St. Martin\\'s press this September.  Scandal: Cesar Sanudo believed that his fiancee Kris Jenner was sleeping with both Robert Kardashian and OJ Simpson when they were engaged (Simpson and the Kardashians above in the mid-80s)  Sanudo\\'s daughter Amber Carillo says in the book that although her father was the son of Mexican immigrants, he had some shocking opinions about interracial dating.  Origin: Sanudo (above with Kris) shared his thoughts with his daughter  She recounts one time when her father had been watching an episode of the family\\'s E! reality series \\'Keeping Up With the Kardashians\\' and said to her: \\'Why would Kris let her kids date black men.\\'  Carillo says she dismissed his remark by saying \\'this is not the 1920s\\' and urging her father to \\'get the fifties and sixties mentality about race out of your head.’  She goes on to reveal however that part of his anger likely stemmed from his belief that Kris had been cheating on him with both Robert and OJ.  \\'That racial mixing angered him. And that’s why he used to say Kris was sexually involved with OJ,\\' explains Carillo.  \\'How real that is, and did my dad witness it, I don’t think so. He said he was pretty sure that she was seeing OJ along with Kardashian, that she had an affair with OJ too.\\'  She later adds: \\'He thought more or less that Kris would be with OJ and I had to correct him.\\'  OJ was a major part of Kris\\' life once she met Robert, as he lived with the pair and Robert\\'s brother Tom at their home in Beverly Hills whenever he and first wife Marguerite were on the outs - which was very often in those final years of their marriage.  He was also with Robert when he first picked Kris up at the airport in Los Angeles, and by Robert\\'s side when he flew to New York to take his future wife back after his relationship with Priscilla Presley came to an end.  On that trip the three stayed at The Plaza and went to Studio 54 before jetting off to Montreal where Simpson was providing commentary for ABC Sports at the 1976 Summer Games.  It was at those Olympics that Bruce Jenner shot to fame with his win in the decathlon.  More allegations: Robert\\'s pastor Kenn Gulliksen and best friends Joni Midigal and Larry Kraines all say that Robert told them privately that he was not Khloe\\'s father (Khloe and Robert above in the late 1980s)  Family affair: His love for Khloe was the same as it was for his two oldest daughters regardless of this fact all three claim, and he refused to ever take a DNA test (family above in the late 1980s)  Fila-ing it: Robert and Kris welcomed their first child, daughter Kourtney, just nine months after their wedding (above in 1979)  Two years later, Kris and Robert walked down the aisle, with their first daughter Kourtney coming just nine months after the pair said \\'I do.\\'  Her birth in 1979 was followed by the arrival of little sister Kim just 18 months later, quickly filling out the family.  Then, a little less than four years after Kim was born, Kris gave birth to a daughter Khloe.  Much has been said over the years about Khloe\\'s paternity, with Kris and her daughters all summarily shooting down any stories or reports claiming that Robert was not the father of Kris\\' third child.  Robert never spoke publicly about the matter, though in at least one legal filing in the aftermath of his separation from Kris years later was reported to have stated that he had \\'four biological children.\\'  Kris and Khloe both say Robert was her father  That is not the story he told however to three of the people who were closest to him back at that time - his pastor Kenn Gulliksen, lifelong friend Joni Midigal and close confident and high school pal Larry Kraines.  \\'Kris and Robert had four children. Well they had three kids and somebody else’s kid,\\' reveals Gulliksen.  \\'Bob never asked my counsel but I simply heard from him that Khloe wasn’t his biological daughter.  He then states: \\'He gave me no names of who the father was. But I certainly know it wasn’t OJ.\\'  Robert did however still love Khloe as if she were a daughter according to Gulliken.  ‘It was my strong impression from him that he loved Khloe very much but he said it in a way that implied she’s not my blood daughter, meaning his biological daughter,\\' he tells Oppenheimer.  ‘My understanding from him was that he and Kris hadn’t had sex during the period of time they would have had to had sex when Khloe was conceived.’  Kris has said many times in the past and wrote in her 2011 memoir that Khloe was conceived in Italy.  Kraines, who was actually at the hospital when Khloe was born, says that Robert told him soon after the delivery: \\'It\\'s all bulls***.\\'  Mystery man: Some have alleged that Khloe\\'s real father is Kris\\' former hairdresser Alex Roldan (above in 2012)  Here comes the bride: New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in \\'Kardashians: An American Drama,\\' which is out in September (Kris and Robert Kardashain with Pastor Kenn Gulliksen at their 1978 wedding)  Despite these private conversation with friends in which he expressed that Khloe was almost certainly not his biological child, Robert refused to take the next step because of the kind of person that he was according to Midigal.  ‘He made a decision that no matter who Khloe’s father was that Robert was going to love her as his own, and it was all done. That was his decision. It was the honorable way of doing it, and the respectful way,’ says Midigal.  \\'He didn’t want a DNA test done, he didn’t want to find out anything. He told me, \"I love Khloe. She’s wonderful. She’s mine, period.” But he knew she wasn’t his. His confirmation to me was, \"She’s mine and I don’t care who the father is.\\'\"  New York Times-bestselling author Jerry Oppenheimer is telling all about Kris Jenner in \\'Kardashians: An American Drama,\\' which is out in September  Among those whose names have been floating around as possibly being Khloe\\'s father are Simpson and Kris\\' hairdresser Alex Roldan.  Kylie Jenner made light of the claims that Roldan was Khloe\\'s father back in 2012 by tweeting a photo of Khloe and the hairdresser, writing: \\'\\'First official photo of my sister and her dad! Like father like daughter!\\'  Khloe meanwhile addressed the rumor in March of last year on an episode of her now cancelled show \\'Kocktails With Khloe.\\'  It came up during a conversation about the dark side of fame, with Khloe expressing her distaste for claims that had been made by her father\\'s widow Ellen Pearson.  \\'I think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad’s wives,\\' said Khloe.  \\'She wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I’m not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.\\'  She went on to say: \\'I was like, \"Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f***ing want. Do not talk about my dad.… He’s not here!”\\'  It is all happening once again however, only this time with three people and not just one claiming Robert confided in them about the fact that Khloe was not biologically a Kardashian.',\n",
       " 'President Donald Trump‘s use of Twitter has long been a controversial component of his presidency, in part because of his frequent use of the “block” button, which the president has unleashed on a number of notable actors, authors and activists who have used Twitter as a platform to criticize him and his administration.  But his critics scored a victory on Wednesday when a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that blocking his foes from viewing his tweets violates the First Amendment — because his Twitter feed is an official government account.  “Well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,” model and author Chrissy Teigen, whom Trump blocked in July 2017, tweeted Wednesday after the judge’s ruling was announced.  According to The New York Times, seven Twitter users and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University sued the president, claiming Trump’s account is part of the government and blocking them violates their First Amendment rights.  Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald agreed with the plaintiffs, noting in her ruling that “the speech in which they seek to engage is protected by the First Amendment.” She also wrote that Trump and White House social media director Dan Scavino “exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account.”  well well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WajEXiAQVi — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 23, 2018  Here’s a running list of notable people who have received the “@arealDonaldTrump blocked you” message on Twitter — but should be able to read his tweets again soon:  1. Laura Packard  Packard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting “America last,” and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.  Don\\'t you mean put America last? https://t.co/8tTxFjdYIw — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Your latest TrumpCare bill would mean 32M Americans will lose their health insurance. What about putting them first? https://t.co/wPObZisLQp — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 19, 2017  Omg. The President of the United States just personally blocked me. pic.twitter.com/MgLfwufOXC — Laura Packard (P.S. Pls ban the nazis already) (@lpackard) September 20, 2017  The morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress — and it isn’t that he’ll lift the block: “I just wish that he would listen.”  But Packard addressed Wednesday’s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.  Oh hai @realdonaldtrump! If you need to unblock thousands (tens of thousands?) of people in a hurry, perhaps due to court order, you can do it 1 by 1 but it\\'s a lot easier to use https://t.co/HswTF8YZED and then do mass unblocking. — Laura Packard (@lpackard) May 23, 2018  2. Rosie O’Donnell  Trump and O’Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host  on ur back ? dear god don – the russians bought their train ticket – u r confused -prostitutes peeed on ur back in moscow @realDonaldTrump — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 23, 2017  Just a few hours after sending the tweet, O’Donnell found herself blocked.  awww @realdonaldtrump – i get it – its too tough to read the truth … poor baby – i understand don – u take care of u – friend #BLOCKED pic.twitter.com/EQxnZarnhE — ROSIE (@Rosie) July 24, 2017  She’s still tweeting about him, though — and has asked others to forward along her messages.  3. Anne Rice  I\\'ve been blocked from Trump\\'s twitter site. Hilarious. This after a few responses to his tweets! Wow. I\\'m amazed! Truly amazed. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  Maybe I\\'ll be personally attacked next. One can always hope. — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  And I so relished responding personally to Trump\\'s tweets. Ah well… — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) June 26, 2017  The president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes — personally responding to Trump’s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it’s almost all she tweets about even now, after she’s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.  Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty  The tweet read:  “The Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.”  Now, like O’Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.  Already been smeared by the right. Please RT this to Trump. He\\'s blocked me. https://t.co/jvnIKnJDsj — Anne Rice (@AnneRiceAuthor) August 13, 2017  4. Chrissy Teigen  After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him \"lol no one likes you\" was the straw pic.twitter.com/MhZ6bXT1Dp — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 25, 2017  The latest addition to the “blocked by Trump” club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for “nine years” — long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:  Lolllllll no one likes you — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 23, 2017  Teigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: “After 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him ‘lol no one likes you’ was the straw.”  Francois Mori/AP  5. Stephen King  Trump has blocked me from reading his tweets. I may have to kill myself. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) June 13, 2017  He’s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president’s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it’s possible they ended up on Trump’s radar.  Donald Trump: A remarkable combination of unhinged and dumb as dirt. Time to start talking impeachment. Really. Enough is enough. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 10, 2017  Trump\\'s tweets in his first hundred days draw a pretty clear portrait: he\\'s an almost textbook case of narcissistic personality disorder. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) May 4, 2017  With President Forrest Trump, every day is like a rancid box of chocolates. You never know what kind of shit you\\'re going to get next. — Stephen King (@StephenKing) April 11, 2017  6. Marina Sirtis  I\\'ve been blocked by our Prez !! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  The actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:  @realDonaldTrump threatening to go to WAR to deflect from Russiagate!! Willing to let our boys die to save his sorry ass! — Marina Sirtis (@Marina_Sirtis) May 9, 2017  Six minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.  7. Bess Kalb  OH. MY. EFFING. GOD.  The President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings. #MAGA pic.twitter.com/oB5zTAs7In — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017  A writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she “hurt his feelings.” There’s no telling which of Kelb’s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:  Trump is the funniest example of why you should always be nice to the makeup lady. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  The President of the United States of America just picked a twitter fight with Rosie O\\'Donnell. https://t.co/yYwVbq74Sh — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 11, 2017  Oh boy, honey. I\\'ve tried to lay off and let you President like you said you would, but this is a new kind of simplistic nonsense rhetoric. — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 28, 2017  8. Andy Signore  INSANITY!! – The @POTUS @realdonaldtrump can\\'t take my tweets criticizing his reign, so they BLOCKED me 😂😂 I have a theory about this (1of8) pic.twitter.com/KcW7JdFpd8 — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 5, 2017  Signore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What’s surprising is that Signore wasn’t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.  I am so damn sick of bully @realDonaldTrump taking words out of context to act out his agenda of fear, corruption & bigotry. #NotMyPresident — Andy Signore (@andysignore) June 4, 2017  By the next night, he was blocked.  9. Angelo Carusone  Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now? pic.twitter.com/KBGG3YKfvf — Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) June 15, 2017  Trump’s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.  Carusone said he hadn’t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.  “Sigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?” Carusone wrote.  10. Holly Figueroa O’Reilly  Who says Trump doesn\\'t read our tweets? 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/SQ8mb06InR — Holly O\\'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 29, 2017  Songwriter O’Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruth calling for an independent probe into the Trump administration’s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She’s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:  Did you seriously use your 11-year-old son, Barron Trump, as a political shield? You are the biggest f\\'ing coward.#TuesdayThoughts pic.twitter.com/wswdoBTsM7 — Holly O\\'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 25, 2017  O’Reilly, however, isn’t taking Trump’s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is “unconstitutional” and seeking to remove it, according to court documents.',\n",
       " 'Lydia McLaughlin has confirmed she will not return to The Real Housewives of Orange County. Lydia returned to the SoCal crew in Season 12 after having previously spent some time on the show back in Season 8. “RHOC has given me a great platform and I’m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time,” she wrote in a blog post on Friday (February 9). “I need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity. After a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don’t see. I trust my path and I’m excited for what the future holds.”  When Season 12 wrapped up, Lydia and her husband, Doug, revealed that they were mulling over plans for them to possibly expand their family with a daughter (more on that in the video below). They are already parents to three sons. In reflecting on her sophomore season on the show, she shared, \"I feel like last time I was with this group of women, I just really observed and I didnt necessarily speak my mind. And this time around, I feel like I really was able to stick up for myself and voice my opinion and I\\'m proud of myself for that.\"  This past season, in addition to watching Lydia\\'s home life with her husband and three kids, fans also got to know her mom, Judy Stirling, a little better; watched Lydia expand her Nobleman magazine empire; and also learned a bit more about her family\\'s history as media moguls in her native Canada.

       " 'Robert Pattinson on \\'Twilight\\' Experience: \\'It\\'s All Fond Memories\\'  Email Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  It looks like Robert Pattinson is looking back at his \"Twilight\" experience with a positive light.  On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film \"Good Time.\" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The \"Twilight\" saga.  It had been five years since the final \"Twilight\" film had been released, \"Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,\" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how \"amazing\" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.  \"It\\'s all fond memories,\" Pattinson remarked about filming the \"Twilight\" movies. \"I mean it\\'s almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it\\'s just such a magical way to spend your 20s.\"  \"I mean it\\'s completely crazy. I still haven\\'t really processed it. I mean I always thought that there\\'d be more of a fallout—a psychological fallout years later,\" the actor adds.  His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow \"Twilight\" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last \"Twilight\" film.

       " '\\'Furious\\' Kylie Jenner accuses Travis Scott of \\'cheating on her with several women\\'  Well, it seems that all is not well in the world of Kylie Jenner. Fresh off the back of rumors that members of her staff have been trying to take photos of her in the privacy of her home, it\\'s being reported that she has had a blazing row with her expected baby daddy, Travis Scott.  As I\\'m more than sure you are aware by now, it\\'s pretty much blindingly obvious that Kylie Jenner is pregnant. While we have yet to receive any form of confirmation from the 20-year-old or her sisters, everything points to the fact that Jenner is expecting. Whether it\\'s her change of tact on Instagram, the fact the had a crib delivered to her house or the latest campaign from Calvin Klein in which she can be seen covering her tummy, Kylie Jenner is pregnant.  However, as the rumors began to become more and more concrete, it was suggested that Jenner and her beau had split up. While it was never confirmed that Kylie and Travis had decided to go their separate ways, a source has revealed to Insider that the two stars had a blazing row at Kris Jenner\\'s house and things turned nasty.  “Kylie and Travis got into a blowout fight after he showed up unexpectedly to her mother Kris’ house, where she’s been staying lately. She flipped out on him and accused him of cheating on her with several women during her pregnancy, including a girl that she is kinda friends with!”  The source continued, saying that the rapper had been doing all that he could to try and win Kylie back, but the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was having none of it.  “He has been trying to do everything he can to win her back, including sending her flowers and gifts,” the source said. “But she is just so emotional right now that she doesn’t know what she wants. The fact that they are still talking and in communication leads some of her friends to believe that they will fix things before the birth of the baby.”  Although Kylie had disappeared from the public eye since the rumors, according to Entertainment Tonight, she’s not planning to hide the fact that she’s a mom once she gives birth.  “Kylie has been chilling at home for the most part and just living her best life. She has really enjoyed this time away from the spotlight. It’s the first time she can remember in her entire life not being followed by cameras and she’s just trying to enjoy this privacy,” a source told the website.  The source continued, saying: “she’s definitely not going to deny that she’s had a baby, or continue to evade questions about it at all.”  The outlet also learned that \"this isn’t a permanent thing. As soon as the baby is born, she will make an announcement and introduce the baby to her fans. She will also address the fact that she went ‘dark’ on social media and in the public.”  The source claims that Kylie will announce the birth on Instagram and also claims that the 20-year-old is extremely excited to be a mother. “Yes, she will release a photo and yes, she will acknowledge the baby. She’s excited to continue to be her authentic self, and that will soon mean being a mother and sharing that with her fans.”  So while there may be trouble in paradise, it looks like we will finally be getting the news we\\'ve all been waiting for shortly. I\\'m calling it guys: Jenner is pregnant and the baby will arrive in the next month or so.',\n",

Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.\",\n",

       " 'Maarten de Boer/Getty Images Entertainment UPDATED: Brendan Fraser Says the HFPA Denied His Claims of Sexual Harassment In a GQ profile from earlier this year, Brendan Fraser claimed that former HFPA president Philip Berk groped him in 2003. The organization quietly launched an internal investigation and, according to Fraser, tried to explain that Berk’s actions were intended as “a joke.” But Fraser’s not laughing.  Recently, I spent some time with the actor Brendan Fraser for a feature in this magazine. In one of our last conversations, he shared a startling story with me. In 2003, he said, he had been groped by a former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization responsible for putting on the Golden Globes. The incident, he said, was traumatic—\"I felt ill. I felt like a little kid\"—and the aftermath even more so: \"I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me.\"  After the story was published, the HFPA issued a statement promising an investigation:  \"The HFPA stands firmly against sexual harassment and the type of behavior described in this article. Over the years we\\'ve continued a positive working relationship with Brendan, which includes announcing Golden Globe nominees, attending the ceremony and participating in press conferences. This report includes alleged information that the HFPA was previously unaware of and at this time we are investigating further details surrounding the incident.\"  EDITOR’S PICK  Since then, the HFPA has remained silent about what they did or did not determine, but according to Fraser, the organization\\'s investigation has now concluded. In April, he says, an independent investigator contacted him and interviewed him about the incident, which took place at the Beverly Hills Hotel in the summer of 2003. There, as Fraser originally recounted to me, he was groped by former HFPA president Philip Berk: \"His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.\" (Berk denied this: \"Mr. Fraser\\'s version is a total fabrication.\" Berk said he pinched Fraser in jest, in reference to a false gossip item he\\'d read about Fraser doing the same to someone else.)  After the HFPA finished its investigation, according to Fraser, the organization contacted him again and proposed issuing a joint statement, which said, \"Although it was concluded that Mr. Berk inappropriately touched Mr. Fraser, the evidence supports that it was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance.\" The organization also apologized to Fraser in the proposed statement and suggested a forward-looking resolution: \"All parties consider this matter to be concluded.\" The HFPA wrote that it looked forward \"to continuing to work with Mr. Fraser.\" And presumably Philip Berk would remain a member in good standing of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and a Golden Globe voter. Berk, in an e-mail, confirmed his ongoing status as an active voter in the HFPA. \"Yes, I certainly am,\" he said.  Fraser said he declined to sign on to the proposed joint statement. \"I don\\'t get the joke,\" he told me last week. Berk\\'s intentions were irrelevant to him—whether they were meant in jest or otherwise, Fraser felt violated. \"I\\'m the only one who would know where I was touched on my body,\" he told me.  Fraser also said that the HFPA declined to share the full results of their investigation with him, or explain what methodology or evidence they used to draw their conclusion: \"What I said to them was, \\'Show me the investigator\\'s report, and then I\\'ll know what I\\'m signing off on.’ ” The HFPA, according to Fraser, showed him a summary of their findings but refused to share the full report the organization said those findings were based on, citing witness-confidentiality concerns. \"They\\'re kind of behaving like wolves in sheep\\'s clothing about it, saying, \\'Oh, we want him to heal.\\' Well, the first step in that direction would be: What am I healing from? Can I please see this report? What is it? They commissioned an investigation. They received their report. And they\\'re not giving any details about it, and they\\'re not giving up the report itself.\"  \"I myself was not shown either report,\" Berk told me, referring to the investigator\\'s findings and the proposed joint statement. \"But [I was] told the statement would absolve me of any wrongdoing.\" Asked if he had faced any discipline from the HFPA, Berk wrote: \"None at all.\"  The HFPA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  In 2003 Fraser, through his representatives at the time, privately sought and received an apology from Berk and the HFPA, though Berk told me in February that the letter admitted \"no wrongdoing,\" describing it as \"the usual \\'If I\\'ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize.’ ” Fraser didn\\'t speak publicly about the incident until earlier this year, when he described it to GQ. He was inspired in part, he said, by seeing friends and former colleagues speak about their own difficult experiences with assault and harassment in Hollywood, and in part by the realization that Berk was still a member of the HFPA and an attendee at the most recent Golden Globes ceremony.  Since his account of what happened to him in the summer of 2003 was published, Fraser has had ample time to reflect. \"If I was a woman, I question if Berk would\\'ve even been in a job in 2003,\" Fraser told me. (In 2014, Berk took a voluntary leave of absence from the HFPA after the publication of his memoir, With Signs and Wonders, which contained material about the organization and its membership that other HFPA members reportedly took issue with; after six months, he resumed full membership.) Fraser said that he was angry at himself for having stayed quiet in 2003, and now he felt like he was being asked to do so again. \"It\\'s about being stripped of your identity, and of a power play being pulled to tamp it down, and being sort of backhandedly complicit in it by keeping quiet, entering into an agreement that you won\\'t talk.\"  This past January, an estimated 19 million people watched the Golden Globes, which is voted on and presented by the HFPA. In Hollywood, the Golden Globes are closely watched as precursors to the Academy Awards, though the voting body of the HFPA, which is kept secret, consists of less than one hundred journalists (compared to more than 6,500 Oscar voters), representing outlets as far-flung as Brazil\\'s Sci-Fi News and Italy\\'s Il Manifesto. The HFPA holds private press conferences and junkets throughout the year with Golden Globe hopefuls: Actors and actresses are asked to appear before members to answer questions and often take photos with them afterward—a cozy arrangement that some in Hollywood have questioned.  “It’s about being stripped of your identity, and of a power play being pulled to tamp it down...”  \"I want to find some way to make medicine out of this poison, which is not specific just to this enterprise,\" Fraser told me. \"There\\'s a system in place that\\'s unwritten. If you abide by it, you will be rewarded. If you don\\'t, you won\\'t be. But outside of that, I want to end this episode, this chapter, in my own life and career and move on, just as I\\'m hopeful that others will be able to in years to come.\"  He was speaking up again, he said, in the hope that HFPA will ask Berk to step down, and institute new policies around harassment—\"I wanted them to have every opportunity to change this\"—but admitted that at this point, he was keeping his expectations in check, both for himself and for others in the industry: \"I think I\\'m just the first brick in the path. Maybe someone else will put another brick down and the path will continue on. I don\\'t know.\"  \"It\\'s not too late,\" he said. \"They can still do the right thing.\"  Update (4:50 p.m.; June 6, 2018): Through a spokesperson, the HFPA has issued a statement.  The HFPA continues to stand firmly against sexual harassment. As such, we have always taken Brendan Fraser’s allegations very seriously—both when he originally spoke out in 2003 and now again 15 years later. Back then, after an initial inquiry, we provided Mr. Fraser with the exact redress he sought—an acknowledgement of the transgression and an apology. Mr. Fraser continued to attend HFPA events including the Golden Globes. When Mr. Fraser raised the allegations again this year in the March issue of GQ, adding several previously unknown details, we conducted an internal review and then took it upon ourselves to commission an independent investigation into the matter to ensure impartiality. We’ve shared the results of that investigation with Mr. Fraser, and again apologized, but also conveyed our need to abide by the investigation’s finding that the exchange was not an intended sexual advance. We want to reiterate that the HFPA understands today—as it did 15 years ago—that what Mr. Fraser experienced was inappropriate.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s not a good time to Jennifer Aniston. After her marriage with Justin Theroux ended, she has been constantly in the limelight being scrutinized for her reactions on how her ex is moving on after the split. A while ago it was Selena Gomez and now it is another actress who has been drawn into the picture. The Friends actress is fed up with hearing news of Emma Stone and Justin\\'s budding romance.  The actress is reportedly furious seeing how things are unfolding for Emma and Justin. According to Radar Online, Jennifer is filled with \\'furious rage\\' looking at both of them get close and taking various trips together. “It bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn’t taking this lying down,” a source told the website.  Jennifer is not taking news about Emma and Justin well (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)  It seems like Jennifer is taking every bit of help she can from her pals in order to get back at Emma. “She’s dragging Emma every chance she gets and warning pals like Jason Bateman and Jimmy Kimmel to avoid her,\" the source added. The website further added that Jennifer is \"fuming\" over their now public romance. “Jen and her squad take issue with the fact that Emma never met a role she couldn’t steal from another actress [most famously ‘La La Land’ from Emma Watson],” the source revealed.  “I don’t think she realizes who she messed with and how far Jen’s reach is,\" the source added. The website claims that the rage Jennifer has towards Emma is a lot like she had over Angelina Jolie after Brad Pitt broke up with her to be with the Maleficent actress. “This is a pattern for Jen, never directing the rage or gossip at the guy who left her but instead at the next woman he hooks up with,\" the source revealed.  Emma Stone and Justin Theroux in NYC yesterday(05/02), leaving/going to a restaurant pic.twitter.com/0Bwhwk8Fzi — emma stone (@stonearchive) May 4, 2018  While Jennifer hasn\\'t taken any steps yet, the source believes that Emma should be careful. “Jen is in revenge mode and Emma needs to recognize that she’s messing with somebody with a lot of loyal Hollywood friends,\" the source said. The rumors about Emma and Justin dating emerged after the two were spotted dining together in NYC. The pair was all smiles as they were photographed heading into Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho for a night out.  At the same time, nearly a month after Justin announced his split from Jennifer Aniston, he made his first public appearance at the Louis Vuitton fashion show during Paris Fashion Week on March 6. The actor was seen sitting next to Michelle Williams and Emma. The following month, Justin shared some pictures on his Instagram where it was seen that the actor was hanging out with the Queer Eye\\'s Jonathan Van Ness and Emma. Knowing how one photo is enough to raise speculation, Justin was careful of the words he used and made sure that he made their relationship status clear in the caption.  \"Save lives! Save lives! Saving lives! Doing the most! Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs,\" he wrote. The pair was also spotted leaving Met Gala together even though they arrived separately at the event. Emma looked flawless as she wore a navy dress with gold embellishments for the event, while Justin chose to keep his look a bit casual as he opted for an all-black ensemble. The pair has been good friends ever since they worked together for Netflix\\'s show \\'Maniac\\'.',\n",

       " 'CLOSE They took their Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fandom to a whole new level. USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she\\'s repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about \"taking somebody out\" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  \"It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),\" Harding said in part of the interview that didn\\'t run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding\\'s life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding\\'s mother isn\\'t fan.  “I don’t give a (expletive) about the movie,\" said LaVona \"Sandy\" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. \"I don’t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.”  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to \"spank\" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  “Take a lie detector (expletive),\" Harding said in response to her mother\\'s denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic \\'I, Tonya\\'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  \"I have two Olympics medals,\" Kerrigan said. \"They didn’t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.”  Harding didn\\'t deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women\\'s figure skating.  \"Sure. Why not?\" Harding said. \"I mean, I was there. I skated.”  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  \"Enough apologizing,\" Harding said. \"She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.\"  PHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan',\n",
       " 'Another Bachelor couple bites the dust.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Derek Peth and Taylor Nolan have decided to end their engagement, they announced on Tuesday. Their breakup comes about a year after they started dating on Paradise, and 10 months after Peth proposed with a stunning Neil Lane sparkler on the reunion show last August.  \"It is with much sadness that we have decided to end our engagement. We put everything we could into our relationship and are heartbroken to go forward separately, but we know this is the best decision for the both of us,\" Peth and Nolan said in a joint statement to ET. \"We will still be present in each other\\'s lives with support, admiration and respect for each other.\"  Before meeting Nolan on Paradise, Peth appeared on JoJo Fletcher\\'s season of The Bachelorette. Nolan, meanwhile, gained notoriety for her \"emotional intelligence\" argument with Corinne Olympios on Nick Viall\\'s season of The Bachelor. Peth and Nolan were pretty much inseparable when they hit the beach for season four of Bachelor in Paradise last summer, and two months later, Peth put a ring on it.  Managing a long-distance relationship -- Peth lives in New York and Nolan resides in Seattle -- was always a concern for the pair.  \"Originally we were like, ‘This is fun, but we\\'re in different states,’” Peth told ET during a joint interview with Nolan last September. “We tried to be realistic and then it turned out I couldn\\'t stay away from her.”  “We had a couple of really amazing days together before filming [the finale] -- we came out [to L.A.] early and did our own thing and I was like, \\'I freaking love this girl, let\\'s do something crazy,\\'” Peth shared of his decision to get down on one knee. “We don\\'t really believe in having \\'the one\\' or that one person; it\\'s really about choosing each other, [but] there\\'s something magnetically that has always attracted me to Taylor. We tried not to like each other, but that\\'s what made it so genuine. We tried as hard as possible to not like each other, every step of the way!”  “I was very resistant, but part of what I love him about it, is that he is so patient with me,” Nolan added. “He allows me to go through my process and is very supportive in that -- he\\'s a very good teammate.”  Season four of Paradise ended with three couples: Lacey Mark and Daniel Maguire (who revealed their breakup at the reunion), Nolan and Peth (who just split), and Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk (who are still together).  Season five, meanwhile, already has one engagement -- Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon. See what they told ET about the special moment in the video below.

       " 'Television networks, viewers, readers and restauranteurs are paying tribute to Anthony Bourdain this weekend, one day after he was found dead in a hotel room in France.  His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon\\'s bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like \"Kitchen Confidential.\"  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain\\'s home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.  Related: Inside Anthony Bourdain\\'s globe-trotting career  Other CNN programs are also honoring Bourdain\\'s legacy.  \"It is hard to imagine he is gone,\" Anderson Cooper said Friday night. \"Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.\"  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past \"Parts Unknown\" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain\\'s all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain\\'s previous show \"No Reservations\" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of \"Parts Unknown\" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now \"with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.\"  That episode will be followed by the tribute special.  Related: How the press can cover suicide without creating a \\'contagion\\'  \"Somebody as vital, as passionate, as alive, as warm as human as Tony Bourdain, I could not imagine, A, that he was gone, and B, that he was gone in this manner,\" Christiane Amanpour said in an interview for the special.  She said his death has \"left a massive hole in\" the world.  The manner of Bourdain\\'s death has also caused CNN and many other news outlets to highlight suicide prevention resources.  All three network nightly newscasts in the U.S. featured the \"lifeline\" number, 800-273-8255, and encouraged people to call for help.  CNN and CNN.com have also been prominently featuring the number.  \"You never know what goes on in anybody\\'s head and you never really know what goes on anyone\\'s heart,\" Cooper said in the CNN tribute.  \"But certainly, you know, the pain he must have been feeling, at least in that moment or in those moments, and the loneliness he must\\'ve been feeling -- it\\'s just terribly sad to think about. And makes me very sad for him to have -- to have succumbed to that.\"  Asking for help  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. It\\'s now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller\\'s ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.',\n",

LOS ANGELES - Adele stood proud with Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lawrence protesting equality for women in America by carrying placards at the 2018 Women\\'s March in Los Angeles on Saturday.  The British pop - star who resides in La La Land with husband Simon Konecki and their five-year-old son Angelo - shared a selfie with the Holiday star and Hunger Games actress with their protest placards as they joined thousands of women speaking out against President Donald Trump and the lack of equality in the US.  The 29-year-old singer says she has raised her little boy to have empathy for the opposite sex.  Speaking about the influence the women in her life have had on her career, the Hello hitmaker captioned the post: \"The most influential people in my life have always been women. My family, my friends, my teachers, my colleagues, and my idols. I am obsessed with all the women in my life. I adore them and need them more and more every day. I am so grateful to be a woman, I wouldn\\'t change it for the world. I hope I\\'m not only defined by my gender though. I hope I\\'m defined by my input to the world, my ability to love and to have empathy. To raise my son to be a a good man alongside the good man who loves me for everything I am and am not. I want what\\'s best for people, I think we all do. We just can\\'t agree on what that is. Power to the peaceful, power to the people x #womensmarch2018 (sic)\"  The Make You Feel My Love singer joined the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon in standing strong and fighting for their rights and hoping to bring change to the country.  On one of her signs, typical of potty-mouthed Adele, she displayed the words: \"Everyone\\'s full of s--t.\"  Her other placard said: \"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change! I am changing the things I cannot accept.\"  Lawrence\\'s read: \"A woman\\'s place, is in the revolution.\"  Whilst Diaz\\'s said: \"A movement should never take us backwards, it should only ever carry us forwards!\"',\n",

In an appearance on CBS’s “Sunday Morning,” the “Million Reasons” singer talked about how her life has changed since becoming famous and how she feels like she has no freedom because of the attention she has been getting. Gaga also said that she finds solace in her home, and that leaving it gives her a bit of anxiety. “I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line I’m not free anymore,” Gaga said.source “It’s like I’m stepping out into this entirely different world where everybody’s allowed to follow me, take pictures of me, treat me like a circus freak and flat out do whatever they want around me and I can’t even call the police to help me because they’re not doing anything wrong,” the singer complained. “I realize that this is part of what I wanted when I set out to become famous and fulfill my dreams, but nobody told me I’d have to give up my privacy completely. And to top it all off – we’ve just had the presidential election and the least favorite guy won. Now I gotta deal with that as well.”source site Asked to elaborate on her opinion on President-elect Donald Trump, Gaga said that he wasn’t her “first choice,” as well as that “he couldn’t have picked a worse time to become President of the United States,” due to the fact that “I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House.” “It was fun pretending to be someone else at the beginning of my career, wearing masks and all that, but there comes a time when you outgrow all those childish costumes and just want to be yourself.

       " 'The One with the Rumor is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series\\' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston\\'s then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of an \"I hate Rachel\" club. The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel (Aniston) was a hermaphrodite.  The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as \"insulting\" by a national intersex education group. Pitt admitted his appearance was mainly to promote his upcoming film, Spy Game.  Plot [ edit ]  Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross\\' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey Tribbiani that she won\\'t be cooking a turkey because of Will\\'s, Chandler\\'s, Rachel\\'s and Phoebe\\'s aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe\\'s maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach.  Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel Green, who he hated in high school, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he - and Ross - founded the \"I Hate Rachel\" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school\\'s 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel\\'s rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will\\'s rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel\\'s queen bee status, and that they\\'re having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn\\'t going to marry her.  The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.  Production [ edit ]  It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will\\'s weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]  Reception [ edit ]  As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: \"Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes\\' viewing, the audience did, too.\"[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was \"definitely [...] going against type\"[7] and LeBlanc called him \"really great on the show\".[4] USA Today rates Will\\'s line \"Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates\" one of the best of the episode.[8]  The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode \"ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional\". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society\\'s website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9]  Primetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]  Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[10]  References [ edit ]',\n",

While vacationing in Italy, Jillian Michaels claims a yacht crew member tried to extort her through an “aggressive and threatening” exchange.  The fitness star opened up on Facebook saying she had chartered a boat for 12 days for $60k, but when she arrived on Tuesday, the boat was rusted and damaged.  The 43-year-old trainer said the crew demanded extra money for fuel because the “gas cash had been drained by mobsters in Capri,” writes the Daily Mail.  In a video sent to the Daily Mail, Michaels is seen arguing with a crew member and is insisting the interaction be filmed. She claims she is being scammed and held hostage.  Michaels found the boat through an online company and was traveling with friends, family members and her daughter.

       " 'King of her heart! Taylor Swift sent fans into a frenzy when opening up about the meaning of her new album, Reputation, and how she found love again.  “[I] think there was a bit of a bait-and-switch that happened with this album when we put out ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ and we’re like, ‘Guys, this album is gonna be one thing.’ And then the album came out,” Swift, 28, told fans at her intimate Taylor Swift NOW concert hosted by AT&T in Chicago on Wednesday, August 29, according to Entertainment Tonight. “It’s legitimately an album about finding love throughout all the noise.”  The Grammy winner elaborated on her remarks, seemingly referencing her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. “I starts with the noise and how that makes all you feel and how it makes you feel when people are saying things about you that you feel, like, aren’t true and living your sort of life in defiance of that. And then, sort of, in the middle of the album you kind of realize, ‘How much do I really value that?’ she explained. “If you can find something real in spite of a bad reputation, then isn’t that what matters the most to you? And doesn’t it matter the most to you that you know who your real friends are now?”  Alwyn, 27, has supported Swift on many stops along her Reputation tour. The duo, whose relationship made headlines in May 2017, recently enjoyed a getaway in London earlier in August. Back in July, the pair jetted off to Turks and Caicos for a July 4 vacation in lieu of Swift’s annual bash.  “They seemed genuinely happy,” an onlooker told Us Weekly at the time of the twosome as they strolled beachside. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”  A source told Us later that month that Swift and Alwyn are the perfect pair. “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” noted the insider. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  Taylor Swift NOW will be available on AT&T’s DirectTV channels (Ch. 1113) or DIRECTV NOW or U-Verse (Ch. 1501) on Thursday, August 30.

       " 'Christopher John Cornell (né Boyle; July 20, 1964 – May 18, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was best known as the lead vocalist for the rock bands Soundgarden and Audioslave. Cornell was also known for his numerous solo works and soundtrack contributions since 1991, and as the founder and frontman for Temple of the Dog, the one-off tribute band dedicated to his late friend Andrew Wood.  Cornell is considered one of the chief architects of the 1990s grunge movement, and is well known for his extensive catalog as a songwriter, his nearly four-octave vocal range,[3] and his powerful vocal belting technique. He released four solo studio albums, Euphoria Morning (1999), Carry On (2007), Scream (2009), Higher Truth (2015) and the live album Songbook (2011). Cornell received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his song \"The Keeper\", which appeared in the 2011 film Machine Gun Preacher, and co-wrote and performed the theme song to the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), \"You Know My Name\". His last solo release before his death was the charity single \"The Promise\", written for the ending credits for the 2016 film of the same name. He was voted \"Rock\\'s Greatest Singer\" by readers of Guitar World,[4] ranked 4th in the list of \"Heavy Metal\\'s All-Time Top 100 Vocalists\" by Hit Parader,[5] 9th in the list of \"Best Lead Singers of All Time\" by Rolling Stone,[6] and 12th in MTV\\'s \"22 Greatest Voices in Music\".[7]  Across his entire catalog, Cornell has sold 14.8 million albums, 8.8 million digital songs, and 300 million on-demand audio streams in the U.S. alone,[8][9] as well as over 30 million records worldwide.[10][11][12] He was nominated for 16 Grammy Awards and won twice.[13][14]  Cornell struggled with depression for much of his life. He was found dead in his Detroit hotel room early on the morning of May 18, 2017, after performing at a Soundgarden concert an hour earlier at the Fox Theater. His death was ruled suicide by hanging.[8]  Early life [ edit ]  Cornell was born Christopher John Boyle on 20 July 1964,[15][16] in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised. His parents are Edward F. Boyle,[17] a pharmacist of Irish-Catholic background,[18][19][20] and Karen Cornell,[17][19] an accountant and psychic of Jewish background.[18][20][21][22][23] After his parents\\' divorce when he was a teenager, Chris and his siblings adopted their mother\\'s maiden name, Cornell, as their surname.[21][15] Cornell was one of six children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters.[15] He attended Christ the King Catholic elementary school,[24] where he performed for the first time in front of a crowd, singing the 1960s anti-war song \"One Tin Soldier\".[24] He later attended Shorewood High School.[25][26] When he was in seventh grade, his mother pulled him and his sister out of Catholic school; Cornell claimed because they were about to be expelled for being too inquisitive.[27] Cornell recalled the episode in a 1994 interview: \"With a religion like that, it\\'s not designed for anyone to question. Being young people who have a natural curiosity and half a brain, you\\'re going to start finding inconsistencies, which there are tons of in organized religion. We both sort of made it clear in classroom situations that we didn\\'t get it. \"Explain this to me.\" And they couldn\\'t, so we started creating a lot of problems.\"[27]  Cornell traced his musical influences back to Little Richard via The Beatles.[28] He spent a two-year period between the ages of nine and eleven solidly listening to The Beatles after finding a large collection of Beatles records abandoned in the basement of a neighbor\\'s house.[29] He described himself at this age as a loner; he was able to deal with his anxiety around other people through rock music.[30] During his teenage years, he spiraled into severe depression, dropped out of school, and almost never left the house.[31] At the age of 12, he had access to alcohol, marijuana, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms and prescription drugs and used them daily by 13, stopped for a year, but relapsed at age 15 for another year until he turned to music.[32][33][20]  Cornell took piano and guitar lessons as a child.[32] He once explained that his mother saved his life when she bought him a snare drum, the instrument he adopted in beginning his path to become a rock musician.[21] Before becoming a successful musician, he worked as a busboy,[34] as a dishwasher,[34] as a fish monger at a seafood wholesaler[31] and was a sous-chef at Ray\\'s Boathouse in Seattle.[35]  In the early 1980s, Cornell was a member of a cover band called The Shemps, which featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto and performed around Seattle.[36] After Yamamoto left The Shemps, the band recruited guitarist Kim Thayil.[36] Cornell and Yamamoto stayed in contact, and after The Shemps broke up, the pair started jamming together, eventually bringing Thayil in to join them.[36]  Recording career [ edit ]  1984–1997 and 2010–2017: Soundgarden [ edit ]  Soundgarden was formed in 1984 by Cornell, Thayil and Yamamoto with Cornell originally on drums and vocals. In 1985, the band enlisted Scott Sundquist as the drummer to allow Cornell to concentrate on vocals.[37] The band\\'s first recordings were three songs that appeared on a compilation for C/Z Records called Deep Six. In 1986, Sundquist, who by that point had a wife and a child, decided to leave the band and spend time with his family.[36] He was replaced by Matt Cameron, the drummer for Skin Yard, who became Soundgarden\\'s permanent drummer.  \"Flower\" Ultramega OK. The song\\'s intro features \"Flower\" was the only single released from. The song\\'s intro features Kim Thayil blowing across his guitar strings. Problems playing this file? See media help.  Soundgarden signed to Sub Pop, releasing the Screaming Life EP in 1987 and the Fopp EP in 1988 (a combination of the two was issued as Screaming Life/Fopp in 1990). Though the band was being courted by major labels, they signed to independent label SST Records in 1988 to release their debut album, Ultramega OK, for which they earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990.[38] The band subsequently signed with A&M Records, becoming the first grunge band to sign to a major label.[31]  In 1989, the band released their second effort and their first album for a major label, Louder Than Love. Following the album\\'s release, Yamamoto left the band to finish his master\\'s degree in physical chemistry at Western Washington University.[39] He was replaced by former Nirvana guitarist Jason Everman. Everman was fired following Soundgarden\\'s tour supporting Louder Than Love. In 1990, the band was joined by a new bassist, Ben Shepherd.[40]  Along with Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden quickly became one of the most successful bands from Seattle\\'s emerging grunge scene in the early 1990s. With Shepherd, the new line-up recorded Badmotorfinger in 1991. The album brought the band to a new level of commercial success, and Soundgarden found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention given to the Seattle music scene. Badmotorfinger included the singles \"Jesus Christ Pose\", \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\". The three singles gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations, while the videos for \"Outshined\" and \"Rusty Cage\" gained considerable airtime on MTV. The song \"Jesus Christ Pose\" and its music video was the subject of widespread controversy in 1991, and the video was removed from MTV\\'s playlist. \"Rusty Cage\" was later covered by Johnny Cash on his 1996 album, Unchained. It also appeared on the fictional radio station Radio X in the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and in the 32-bit version of Road Rash. \"Room a Thousand Years Wide\" was released (along with the B-side \"HIV Baby\") as a 7\" single through Sub Pop\\'s Single of the Month club a full year before the release of Badmotorfinger, and later re-recorded for the album. Badmotorfinger exposed Soundgarden to its first mainstream success: it was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1992,[38] and was later ranked number 45 in the October 2006 issue of Guitar World on the magazine\\'s list of the 100 greatest guitar albums of all time.[41]  The band\\'s fourth studio album, 1994\\'s Superunknown, proved to be the band\\'s breakthrough album. Upon its release in March 1994, Superunknown debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[42] The album launched several successful singles, including \"Spoonman\" and \"Black Hole Sun\", and brought Soundgarden international recognition. Superunknown achieved quintuple platinum status in the United States,[43] triple platinum status in Canada,[44] and gold status in the United Kingdom,[45] Sweden,[46] and the Netherlands.[47] Rolling Stone gave Superunknown four out of five stars. Reviewer J.D. Considine said Superunknown \"demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career.\" Considine criticized \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Half\", stating that the former is \"not a very good song\" while the latter \"is the virtual definition of a B-side.\"[48] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that \"Superunknown actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept.\" He added that \"Soundgarden ... want[s] something different from standard heavy metal.\"[49] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A, saying \"Soundgarden is pumped and primed on Superunknown, and they deliver the goods.\" He praised it as a \"hard-rock milestone—a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and \\'90s anomie and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal.\"[50] The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995.[51] Two singles from Superunknown, \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\", won Grammy Awards, and the music video for \"Black Hole Sun\" won a MTV Video Music Award and a Clio Award.[38][52] Superunknown was ranked number 336 on Rolling Stone magazine\\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,[53] and \"Black Hole Sun\" was ranked number 25 on VH1\\'s list of the 100 greatest songs of the \\'90s.[54]  \"Burden in My Hand\" \"Burden in My Hand\" was the second single released from Down on the Upside. The song was written by Cornell and blends acoustic and electric instrumentation. Problems playing this file? See media help.  The band\\'s fifth album was 1996\\'s self-produced Down on the Upside. The album spawned several singles, including \"Pretty Noose\", \"Burden in My Hand\" and \"Blow Up the Outside World\". The album was notably less heavy than the group\\'s preceding albums, and marked a further departure from the band\\'s grunge roots. Soundgarden explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds.[55] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said, \"Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.\"[56]  However, tensions within the group arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell reportedly clashing over Cornell\\'s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band\\'s trademark.[57] Despite favorable reviews, the album did not match the sales of Superunknown.[43]  In 1997, Soundgarden received another Grammy nomination, for the lead single \"Pretty Noose\".[58] As tensions grew within the band, reportedly due to internal strife over its creative direction, Soundgarden announced it was disbanding on April 9, 1997. In a 1998 interview, Thayil said, \"It was pretty obvious from everybody\\'s general attitude over the course of the previous half-year that there was some dissatisfaction.\"[59]  Cornell, Cameron and Shepherd performing with Soundgarden at Lollapalooza 2010  On January 1, 2010, Cornell alluded to a Soundgarden reunion via his Twitter account, writing: \"The 12-year break is over and school is back in session. Sign up now. Knights of the Soundtable ride again!\" The message linked to a website that featured a picture of the group performing live and a place for fans to enter their e-mail address to get updates on the reunion. Entering that information unlocked an archival video for the song \"Get on the Snake\", from Soundgarden\\'s second studio album, 1989\\'s Louder Than Love.[60]  In March 2010, Soundgarden announced that they would be headlining Lollapalooza 2010. Soundgarden made the announcement through their website and email list.[61] On April 16, 2010, Soundgarden held a secret show at the Showbox Theater on First Avenue in downtown Seattle, publicized via the band\\'s mailing list. The show was billed as Nudedragons, an anagram for Soundgarden.[62]  Asked in August 2010 if Soundgarden will record new material, Cornell replied, \"it would be exciting to record one song, to hear how Soundgarden-ish that might be this much time later. But for me, it\\'s been more of a trip relearning the songs and playing them together. Some of the songs we\\'re approaching we\\'ve never played live.\"[63]  Soundgarden made their first television appearance since their reunion on Conan O\\'Brien\\'s second episode of Conan on November 9, 2010 on TBS and toured North America in summer 2011. In summer 2012, Soundgarden released a new single and video, \"Live to Rise\", for The Avengers movie soundtrack. Their sixth album, King Animal, was released in November 2012 to largely positive reviews.  Soundgarden had continued to tour worldwide and guitarist Kim Thayil mentioned in several interviews that the band was to begin work on material for their seventh album.[64]  Following Cornell\\'s death, the surviving members of Soundgarden discussed the possibility of moving on with a replacement for him,[65][66][67][68] but Thayil confirmed in an October 2018 interview with Seattle Times that the band had once again dissolved.[69][70]  1998–2000 and 2006–2017: Solo career [ edit ]  In 1998, Cornell began working on material for a solo album on which he collaborated with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of the band Eleven. The album, titled Euphoria Morning, was released on September 21, 1999. In his first ever solo tour Cornell spent seven months on the road from September 13, 1999 to March 7, 2000 playing 61 shows[71] in support of Euphoria Morning. Cornell performed two of those coinciding with the debut of the album on September 21 and 22, 1999 at the Henry Fonda Theater in Hollywood California. Attendance for the shows were high, considering he performed the initial shows before fans were even familiar with the music. The touring band was made up of some of the contributing musicians Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Rick Markmann, and Greg Upchurch. The album proved commercially unsuccessful selling 393,000 copies in the U.S.,[72] although the album\\'s single \"Can\\'t Change Me\" was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 2000 Grammy Awards.[73] Cornell recorded a version of Can\\'t Change Me in French,[74] this version is a bonus on Euphoria Morning\\'s deluxe version.[75] The album includes \"Wave Goodbye\", Cornell\\'s tribute to his late friend Jeff Buckley.[76][77] It has been noted that Euphoria Morning is influenced by Buckley\\'s songwriting and distinctive vocal style.[76] The album was re-released in 2015 on CD and vinyl and retitled Euphoria Mourning, with Cornell stating in the press release that he had originally intended the album to be called that, but his manager at the time, Jim Guerinot, suggested that \"Euphoria Morning\" without the \"u\" would be a better title. \"The title was so beautifully poetic to begin with, just the concept of euphoria in mourning; it was a moment I felt inspired and I let all the air out of it. So when we decided to do its first vinyl release I thought, I want to change the fuckin\\' title! [Laughs] It\\'s time to change it,\" Cornell stated.[34]  An unreleased song called \"Heart of Honey\" was also recorded in collaboration with Johannes and Shneider during this period. According to Alain Johannes,[78] \"Heart of Honey\" was recorded for the film Titan A.E. but not used. The song leaked on the internet.[79] While on his solo tours between 2011–2016, Cornell would often pay tribute to the late Natasha Shneider and play the song \"When I\\'m Down\", (from the album Euphoria Morning that Shneider produced) accompanied by a vinyl recording of the original piano track that Shneider performed for the song.[80][81][82][83]  \"Billie Jean\" unplugged From the live album Chris Cornell: Unplugged in Sweden Problems playing this file? See media help.  Though not officially released onto CD, an hour-long acoustic concert Cornell performed on September 7, 2006 at O-Baren in Stockholm, is widely available for download under the title Chris Cornell: Unplugged in Sweden. A promotional CD for his solo album, Carry On, was released in March 2007, titled The Roads We Choose – A Retrospective. The 17-song CD included songs from Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave and Cornell\\'s solo work.  On June 5, 2007, Cornell released his second solo album, Carry On, produced by Steve Lillywhite. It debuted at number 17 on the American Billboard charts. Among the artists who accompanied him on his second solo release was friend Gary Lucas, who contributed acoustic guitar to some of the tracks. Cornell has stated that he is always writing, and that there are some songs that he was not able to put onto an Audioslave album.[84] While recording his second solo album, Cornell was involved in a motorcycle accident.[85] He was apparently \"rear-ended by a truck in Studio City, Los Angeles while riding his motorcycle\" and \"catapulted 20 feet into the air.\" He was able to walk away from the accident, but had severe cuts and bruises. He returned to the studio later that day.  Cornell performing live in Melkweg in Amsterdam , the Netherlands in 2007  In 2007, Cornell appeared as support to Aerosmith on at least two legs of their 2007 world tour[86]—Dublin, London, and Hyde Park—and to Linkin Park in Australia and New Zealand.[87] These shows formed part of his own ongoing world tour which began in April 2007 and continued into 2008 and 2009. Cornell has described his touring band—comprising guitarists Yogi Lonich and Peter Thorn, bassist Corey McCormick and drummer Jason Sutter—as \"musicians that could get the whole picture\" playing music by Soundgarden and Audioslave, as well as his solo material.[88]  In 2008, Cornell was featured on the Main Stage of Linkin Park\\'s Projekt Revolution tour.[89] Throughout the tour, Cornell collaborated with Linkin Park\\'s Chester Bennington while performing \"Hunger Strike\", and with Street Drum Corps for a number of his Soundgarden tracks.[90] While Linkin Park would perform their Grammy-winning song \"Crawling\", he would appear on stage singing the second verse of the song, the outro, and harmonies Aaron Lewis provided for the Reanimation version.[90]  Cornell worked with producer Timbaland on his studio album Scream, which was released on March 10, 2009.[91] Timbaland has referred to the recording sessions as \"The best work I\\'ve done in my career,\" and predicted that Cornell will be the \"first rock star in the club\". Cornell called the new album \"a highlight of my career\". The album was largely panned by critics,[92][93][94] but was the highest charting album of Cornell\\'s solo career, reaching No. 10 on the Billboard 200.[95][96]  Chris Cornell performing at Quart Festival 2009, Kristiansand, Norway  On April 2, 2009, Cornell took over Atlanta Rock station, Project 961, WKLS. For 24 hours the station became \"Chris-FM\" and included a two-hour special of Cornell DJing and playing his favorite songs of his career with the stories behind them leading up to a rebroadcast of his solo show from the previous night.[97] On September 11, 2009, Cornell performed John Lennon\\'s \"Imagine\" on The Tonight Show with Conan O\\'Brien.  In January 2011, Cornell announced his solo acoustic \"Songbook\" tour, continuing a series of acclaimed solo acoustic shows in Los Angeles during 2009 and 2010. The first leg of the sold-out tour began on April 1, 2011 and continued through the U.S. and Canada until May 6, resuming in October and visiting New Zealand, Australia, South America and the U.S. again before ending on December 17. The tour received universally positive reviews.[98]  In November 2011 Cornell, released Songbook, an acoustic live album featuring songs recorded during Cornell\\'s \"Songbook\" tour in North America. It was his first live album as a solo artist and includes stripped-down solo performances of songs from Cornell\\'s whole career as a solo artist as well as with Soundgarden, Audioslave, and Temple of the Dog, plus covers of Led Zeppelin\\'s \"Thank You\" and John Lennon\\'s \"Imagine\". The album received largely positive reviews, with AllMusic calling it Cornell\\'s \"best solo offering to date\".[99] Cornell continued his \"Songbook\" tour in Europe and the U.S. during 2012 and 2013 to further acclaim.[100][101]  Cornell performed a 10-minute acoustic set at the Commander-in-Chief\\'s Ball in the White House on January 21, 2013, which recognized Medal of Honor recipients and Wounded Warriors. He returned later in the evening with Soundgarden to perform at Barack Obama\\'s Inaugural Ball, doing a three-song set at the event.[102]  In January 2015, Cornell announced via his Twitter account that he was in the studio recording a new solo album. Cornell\\'s last studio album, Higher Truth, was released on September 18, 2015.[103]  The last solo release prior to his death was the charity single \"The Promise\", written for the ending credits for the movie of the same name about the Armenian Genocide.[104][105] Prior to his death, Cornell committed all proceeds from the song to support refugees and vulnerable children.[106]  On February 26, 2018, Cornell\\'s first posthumous song was released. Cornell composed the music and added lyrics[107] to Johnny Cash\\'s poems \"You Never Knew My Mind\" and \"I Never Knew Your Mind\". The song, titled \"You Never Knew My Mind\", is featured on the album Johnny Cash: Forever Words, a collection of songs created from Cash\\'s unused poetry, lyrics and letters interpreted by several artists.[108]  2001–2007: Audioslave [ edit ]  Audioslave was formed after Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine and the remaining members were searching for another vocalist. Producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they contact Cornell. Rubin played the Soundgarden song \"Slaves & Bulldozers\" for the remaining Rage Against the Machine band members to showcase his ability. Cornell was in the writing process of a second solo album, but decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk when they approached him. Morello described Cornell: \"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn\\'t believe it. It didn\\'t just sound good. It didn\\'t sound great. It sounded transcendent. And ... when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can\\'t deny it.\"[109] The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal and began working in the studio in late May 2001.[110][111]  Their debut album, Audioslave, released in November 2002, spawned hits such as \"Cochise\", \"Like a Stone\" and \"Show Me How to Live\", and has reached triple platinum status in the United States. The band was nearly derailed before the album\\'s release; Cornell was going through alcohol problems and a slot on the Ozzfest tour was canceled.[35] During this time, there was a rumor that Cornell had checked himself into drug rehabilitation. He later confirmed it in an interview with Metal Hammer that was conducted from a clinic payphone.[112] In a San Diego CityBeat article, Cornell explained that he went through \"a horrible personal crisis\" during the making of the first record, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife. The problems were ironed out and Cornell remained sober.[113] The band toured through 2003,[114] before resting in 2004 to record their second album.[115]  Audioslave\\'s second album, Out of Exile, was released in May 2005 and debuted at number one on the U.S. charts. The album has since gone on to achieve platinum status.[116] The album features the singles \"Out of Exile\", \"Be Yourself\", \"Your Time Has Come\" and \"Doesn\\'t Remind Me\". Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive changes in his life since 2002.[117] He also described the album as more varied than the debut and relying less on heavy guitar riffs.[113] Critics initially described Audioslave as an amalgamation of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden,[118] but by the band\\'s second album, Out of Exile, noted that they had established a separate identity. The album was received more favorably than Audioslave\\'s debut; critics noted Cornell\\'s stronger vocals, likely the result of quitting smoking and drinking,[119] and pointed out that Out of Exile is \"the sound of a band coming into its own\".[120] AllMusic praised the album as \"lean, hard, strong, and memorable\".[121] The lyrics, however, were still a common complaint; musicOMH.com wrote that Cornell\\'s lyrics \"continue to border on the ridiculous\".[122]  On May 6, 2005, Audioslave played a free show in Havana, Cuba.[123] Audioslave became the first American rock group to perform a concert in Cuba, playing in front of an audience of 70,000.[124] The band traveled to Havana on May 4 to interact with Cuban musicians.[125] Cornell commented: \"Hopefully, this concert will help to open the musical borders between our two countries.\" The 26-song set concert was the longest the band had ever played.[126]  In early 2006 the band returned, recording their third album as they had written most of the material during the tour. The band released the album, titled Revelations, in September 2006. Revelations was influenced by 1960s and 1970s funk and R&B music.[127] The first two singles were \"Original Fire\" and \"Revelations\". Two of the songs from the third album, \"Shape of Things to Come\" and \"Wide Awake\" were also prominently featured in Michael Mann\\'s 2006 film, Miami Vice, prior to the release of the album. Despite the exposure to other forms of media and the positive critical buzz for their third album, Audioslave did not tour behind the release. They went into hiatus to allow Cornell to complete \"You Know My Name\", the theme song for the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale, and Morello to pursue his own solo work under the moniker of the Nightwatchman.[128]  All of Audioslave\\'s lyrics were written by Cornell, whilst all four members were credited with writing the music. Their songwriting process was described by Wilk as \"more collaborative\" and \"satisfying\" than Rage Against the Machine\\'s, which was \"a battle creatively\". Cornell, for his part, saw Soundgarden\\'s songwriting method as inferior to Audioslave\\'s.[129][130] Cornell\\'s lyrics were mostly apolitical; Audioslave\\'s Morello referred to them as \"haunted, existential poetry\".[131] They were characterized by his cryptic approach, often dealing with themes of existentialism,[132] love, hedonism,[133] spirituality and Christianity.[131] Cornell\\'s battle with addiction to prescription drugs and alcoholism was a defining factor in the writing and recording process. Even though the singer admitted that he was \"never able to write effectively\" while drinking,[134] and attended rehab after recording the debut album, Morello stated that Revelations was \"the first record [Cornell] didn\\'t smoke, drink, or take drugs through the recording.\"[135] However, Morello said: \"Chris was stone sober during the making of our Out of Exile album. Chris was also sober during the making of Revelations and prior to recording he gave up smoking as well. I apologize for any confusion or concern that was stirred up by the original article. Sobriety can be a matter of life or death and Chris\\'s courage in maintaining his health for years has been an inspiration.\"[136]  News about Cornell\\'s departure emerged in July 2006, when insiders stated that after the third album he would leave to pursue for a solo career. The singer immediately denied the rumors, stating: \"We hear rumors that Audioslave is breaking up all the time. [...] I always just ignore [them].\"[128] On February 15, 2007, Cornell officially announced his departure from Audioslave, stating that \"Due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences, I am permanently leaving the band Audioslave. I wish the other three members nothing but the best in all of their future endeavors.\"[137] As the other three members were busy with the Rage Against the Machine reunion with de la Rocha coming back, and Morello and Cornell had each released solo albums in 2007, Audioslave officially disbanded.[138][139]  On January 17, 2017, it was announced that Audioslave would reunite for their first show in twelve years at Prophets of Rage\\'s Anti-Inaugural Ball, protesting President Donald Trump\\'s inauguration as President of the United States.[140] The event took place on January 20, 2017.[141]  Asked in February 2017 if there would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, frontman Cornell replied, \"It\\'s always a possibility. I mean, we\\'ve been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about actually picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody\\'s so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that\\'s taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it\\'s really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it\\'s comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody\\'s up for it.\"[142]  Other musical projects [ edit ]  Center for Disease Control Boys [ edit ]  From 1986 to 1987, Cornell was also a member of the satirical Western swing band Center for Disease Control Boys.[143]  Temple of the Dog [ edit ]  \"Hunger Strike\" Temple of the Dog. The song was written by Cornell and features a duet between Cornell and \"Hunger Strike\" was the first single released from. The song was written by Cornell and features a duet between Cornell and Eddie Vedder Problems playing this file? See media help.  While still in Soundgarden, Cornell recorded an album with members of what would become Pearl Jam. This collaboration went under the name Temple of the Dog, and the self-titled album was released in 1991. The album is a tribute to their mutual friend, and Cornell\\'s former roommate,[144] Andrew Wood. Wood, the former lead singer of Mother Love Bone, had died of a heroin overdose the year before. Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard of Mother Love Bone teamed up with Mike McCready, new vocalist Eddie Vedder, and drummer Dave Krusen in 1990, forming Pearl Jam. Cameron would eventually become Pearl Jam\\'s drummer in 1998.[145]  Temple of the Dog has gone on to sell more than a million copies,[146][147] thanks in large part to the singles \"Say Hello 2 Heaven\" and \"Hunger Strike\", the latter of which features a duet between Cornell and Vedder. This was the first time Vedder was recorded professionally.[148] Vedder said about Hunger Strike in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead; \"I really like hearing that song. I feel like I could be real proud of it – because one, I didn\\'t write it, and two, it was such a nice way to be ushered onto vinyl for the first time. I\\'m indebted to Chris time eternal for being invited onto that track.\"[149]  During a 2003 Pearl Jam show at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Cornell appeared as a surprise guest. After playing a short acoustic set, Cornell joined Vedder and the rest of the band to perform \"Hunger Strike\" and \"Reach Down\".[150]  On October 6, 2009, Cornell made a surprise appearance during a Pearl Jam concert at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles. The reunited Temple of the Dog played \"Hunger Strike\". At the end of the concert, Cornell took a bow with the band along with Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains.[151]  In September 2011, he joined members of Pearl Jam for a Temple of the Dog live reunion at the two-day PJ20 Festival at Alpine Valley, Wisconsin.[152]  On both October 25 and 26, 2014, Cornell joined Pearl Jam onstage to perform \"Hunger Strike\" at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California during the 28th Annual Bridge School Benefit, the latter being the last time that Vedder and Cornell performed the song together.[153] On January 30, 2015, Pearl Jam bandmates (minus Vedder) Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Matt Cameron joined Chris Cornell and Mike McCready during the Mad Season Sonic Evolution Concert at Benaroya Hall with the Seattle Symphony. The group performed two songs, \"Reach Down\" and \"Call Me a Dog\".[154]  The band toured for the first time in the fall of 2016 in celebration of the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album.[155][156] Vedder did not participate on the tour citing \"family commitments\", but the crowd sang his part in \"Hunger Strike\",[157] and Cornell dedicated the song to Vedder during the band\\'s concert at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on November 21, 2016.[158]  Alice Mudgarden [ edit ]  Cornell, together with Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney, contributed vocals on the Alice in Chains song \"Right Turn\", from the 1992 EP Sap, although the band given credit for this song is Alice Mudgarden.[159][160] The song was featured in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down.[161]  In 1992, Cornell and three other former members of Temple of the Dog played under the name M.A.C.C. (McCready, Ament, Cameron, Cornell), recording the song \"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\"[162] for the 1993 album, Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix.[163][164] The band performed the song live for the first time during the first Temple of the Dog tour in November 2016.[165]  Collaborations [ edit ]  Cornell worked as a co-producer and backing vocalist on the Screaming Trees\\' 1991 album, Uncle Anesthesia.[166][167] He acted in a cameo role and an onstage performance in Cameron Crowe\\'s 1992 Seattle-based film, Singles.[168]  Cornell contributed vocals on Alice Cooper\\'s \"Stolen Prayer\"[169] and \"Unholy War\" [170] (which he also wrote) from the 1994 album, The Last Temptation. In 1997, Cornell collaborated with Eleven on a rendition of the song, \"Ave Maria\", for the Christmas compilation album, A Very Special Christmas 3.[171]  In the \\'90s, Cornell teamed up with Heart\\'s Ann and Nancy Wilson for a cover of the Rolling Stones\\' \"Wild Horses\", when the sisters were performing as The Lovemongers.[172] Bootleg versions of the live performances are available online.[172] Cornell and the Wilsons also performed \"Wild Horses\" and The Lovemongers\\' song \"Sand\" at Layne Staley\\'s funeral in 2002.[173][174][175]  It was incorrectly believed (for many years)[citation needed] that Cornell had written the Eleven song \"Someone to Die For\", featured on the 2004 Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. The song is performed by Jimmy Gnecco of Ours and Brian May of Queen on the soundtrack, and the lyrics are credited to Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider and Cornell.[176] However, the ASCAP song database only shows Johannes and Shneider as the songwriters.[177] Cornell had recorded a demo of the song some time earlier,[citation needed] which was released only to members of the Eleven street team.[citation needed] The version recorded by Cornell and Eleven can be found on the internet.[178]  Cornell co-wrote (with Brian Howes) David Cook\\'s first post-American Idol album single, \"Light On\", released in 2008. And in 2009, he contributed vocals on the song, \"Mister Dirt\", from the album, Good.Night.Melody, by Joshua David Lewis [179]  In 2009, Cornell co-wrote a song with a fan named Rory de la Rosa, who had lost his six-year-old daughter to cancer in 2008, and he was diagnosed with the same illness shortly afterwards. He reached out to Cornell to tell him how much his music impacted his life and also the bond it helped create for him and his daughter, and he sent Cornell a poem called \"I Promise It\\'s Not Goodbye\". Cornell was so moved that he turned the poem into a song with the same title. De la Rosa gave Cornell permission to post the song online. It was available for free download on Cornell\\'s official website in April 2009. Cornell asked, however, that his fans would consider making a donation in memory of Rory\\'s daughter and to help ease the financial burden of his disease.[180][181] In 2013, Cornell made the song available for streaming on his official website in honor of the kids who lost their lives in the Sandy Hook tragedy. Links were provided for donations in memory of the victims.[182]  Cornell sang one song (which he co-wrote) on \"Slash\", Slash\\'s solo record released in April 2010.[183] The song is called \"Promise\" and it was premiered at amazon.com on March 26, 2010.[184] He contributed vocals on the song, \"Lies\", on the 2010 album, Third and Double, by Gabin which was subsequently released as a single in October 2010. Cornell appears on the Carlos Santana album Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time, where he sings on the cover of Led Zeppelin\\'s \"Whole Lotta Love\".[185]  Cornell wrote the lyrics and shared vocals with Andrew Wood in the song \"Island of Summer\", which was recorded while they were living together in Seattle.[144] The song was released for the first time in the 2011 album \"Melodies & Dreams\", a collection of Wood\\'s unreleased recordings and demos.[186]  Cornell sings backing vocals in a cover of the Everly Brothers\\' song \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\", on Rita Wilson\\'s debut album AM/FM, released in 2012.[187]  On April 18, 2013, the Seattle band Heart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and Cornell gave Heart\\'s induction speech and emotionally talked about what heroes and role models Ann and Nancy Wilson had been to him and other musicians in Seattle. \"For me, and for countless other men and women, they have earned, at long last, their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,\" Cornell said.[188] Cornell also joined fellow Seattle musicians Jerry Cantrell and Mike McCready to play guitar for Heart\\'s hit song \"Barracuda\" alongside Ann and Nancy Wilson at the ceremony.[189][190]  On January 30, 2015, Cornell joined Mike McCready and Barrett Martin plus Duff McKagan, Sean Kinney, the Seattle Symphony and others in a special \\'Sonic Evolution\\' concert at Seattle\\'s Benaroya Hall in a tribute to Mad Season.[191] The performance was released as a live album in August 2015, entitled Mad Season / Seattle Symphony: Sonic Evolution / January 30, 2015 / Benaroya Hall.[192] Proceeds will benefit the Seattle Symphony and Vitalogy Foundation.[192]  In 2016 he sang Drive My Car in Beat Bugs episode 18b.[193]  Soundtrack contributions [ edit ]  In 1992, Cornell contributed his first solo song \"Seasons\", and Soundgarden\\'s song \"Birth Ritual\" to the Singles soundtrack.[194]  He also contributed the song \"Sunshower\" (a bonus track on the Japanese release of Euphoria Morning) to the soundtrack of the 1998 film, Great Expectations,[195] and a reworked version of the track \"Mission\", retitled \"Mission 2000\", was used on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Mission: Impossible 2.[196]  Cornell and composer David Arnold collaborated on the song \"You Know My Name\", which Cornell co-wrote and performed and which accompanies the opening titles for the 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale.[197] \"You Know My Name\" is the first theme song since 1983\\'s Octopussy to use a different title than the film, the first ever sung by a male American, and the first ever title theme song that did not appear on the soundtrack album. \"You Know My Name\" won a 2006 Satellite Award in the category of Best Original Song,[198] and a 2007 World Soundtrack Award in the category of Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film.[199] The song sold 323,000 digital copies and 3.5 million streams,[8] and was also nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 2008 Grammy Awards.[200] This song became the first song recorded for his solo album Carry On, which he began work on in 2007.  In August 2011, Cornell released \"The Keeper\", an original song written for the Marc Forster-directed 2011 film Machine Gun Preacher. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2012. For the first 24 hours after its release, the song was exclusively available as part of the \"Donate to Download\" campaign for Sam Childers\\' Angels of East Africa children\\'s charity. The song is also the lead track on the film\\'s soundtrack album.[201]  In 2012, Soundgarden released their first song in 15 years, \"Live to Rise\", written for The Avengers movie soundtrack.[202]  In 2013, Cornell wrote the song \"Misery Chain\", for the soundtrack to the film 12 Years a Slave, in which he performed a duet with Joy Williams.[203][204]  In 2016, Cornell covered the song \"Stay With Me Baby\" for the soundtrack of the HBO TV series Vinyl.[205] Cornell said about recording the song; \"I was very honored to be asked to record a version of \\'Stay With Me Baby\\' for Vinyl. I get to pay tribute to Terry Reid, whose version of the song has been a favorite of mine for many years, and be included on a great soundtrack with an amazing group of artists.\"[206]  His last soundtrack contribution was the song \"The Promise\", written for the ending credits for the movie of the same name released in 2017.[104]  Musical style [ edit ]  Cornell performing in Lisbon in 2009 at the Optimus Alive!09  Cornell\\'s songwriting often features non-standard chord progressions and melodies that do not conform with one diatonic scale. A prominent example is \"Black Hole Sun\", which not only involves many kinds of open chords and several key changes in short sequences, but also unique melody phrases with large-interval jumps.[207]  A recurrent characteristic is his use of major-only chord sequences (\"Sweet Euphoria\",[208] \"Pretty Noose\"[209]), which also leads to more subtle key changes.  Cornell\\'s most concentrated example of his own songwriting style remains on his first solo album Euphoria Morning,[210] as his subsequent works, whether with Audioslave or on his later solo albums, tend toward the conventional and only occasionally contain short but inventive interludes (e.g., \"Like a Stone\",[211] \"Disappearing Act\", \"No Such Thing\"[212]).  Cornell had a multi-octave range. He was a baritone[213][214][215] with an ability to sing extremely high in the tenor range,[216] as well as in the lower register of a baritone voice. He showcased this in various songs, most notably the studio and the demo versions of \"Beyond the Wheel\", where he can be heard spanning three octaves. He also experimented with various different vocal styles, ranging from light falsetto to brutal screams and chants. In addition to singing rock and metal mainly with Soundgarden and Audioslave, Cornell sang the blues,[217] neo-soul[218] and stripped-down acoustic numbers.[219]  Other work [ edit ]  Cornell made a cameo in the 1992 film Singles.[220] He was the face of fashion producer John Varvatos\\' 2006 ad campaign.[221] Cornell became a restaurateur with the opening of his restaurant, Black Calavados, in Paris,[222] and was also the owner of the music publishing company You Make Me Sick I Make Music.[223]  In 2009, Cornell planned to turn Philip Carlo\\'s true crime book The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez, into a film, collaborating with Carlo to produce the screenplay.[224] In 2011, James Franco was attached to direct the film and star in the role of Ramirez.[225][226]  In popular culture [ edit ]  Garbage\\'s song \"Fix Me Now\" from the band\\'s debut album was originally called \"Chris Cornell\". According to lead singer Shirley Manson, she was obsessed with Cornell at the time of the release of Soundgarden\\'s hit song \"Black Hole Sun\". A demo version of \"Fix Me Now\" has Manson singing Cornell\\'s name.[227]  The line \"I\\'m looking California, and feeling Minnesota\" from Soundgarden\\'s song \"Outshined\" (written by Cornell), inspired the title of Steven Baigelman\\'s 1996 film Feeling Minnesota, starring Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz.[228]  Cornell\\'s song \"Preaching the End of the World\" from his debut solo album Euphoria Morning, inspired the title of Lorene Scafaria\\'s 2012 film Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, starring Steve Carell and Keira Knightley.[229][230]  Personal life [ edit ]  In 1985, Cornell started dating Susan Silver,[231][232][233] the manager of Alice in Chains, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees,[234] and they got married in 1990.[33][235] They had a daughter, Lillian Jean, born in June 2000.[236][235] He and Silver divorced in 2004.[235] In December 2008, Cornell reported via his official website that he had finally won back his collection of 15 guitars after a four-year court battle with Silver.[237] In 2004, he married Vicky Karayiannis,[238][239] a Paris-based American publicist of Greek heritage.[35] The couple had a daughter together, Toni, in September 2004,[235][35] and a son, Christopher Nicholas, in December 2005.[240] In 2012, the Cornells created the Chris and Vicky Cornell Foundation[241][242] which works for homeless, poor, abused or neglected children. In 2013, a portion of proceeds from ticket sales went to benefit the cause.[243]  In a 2008 television interview, Cornell said about religion, \"I don\\'t follow any particular one. … Ultimately I think I\\'m sort of a freethinker and kind of open. … So many bad things–as well as good things–have happened based on people just sort of blindly following religion that I kind of feel like I want to stay away from any type of specific denomination or any religion period. If for no other reason than just that. I don\\'t want to be involved with anything or condone any school of thought that at some point and in some way causes the death of innocent people, or tragedies where initial fantastic ideas [are] distorted. Like the life, for example, of Jesus is well-documented. It\\'s corroborated by different people, who had different backgrounds, and different levels of education. And they wrote about it. We know that this guy existed, and we know pretty much what he said, and it\\'s pretty simple. Everything from that point on in terms of wars and fighting over land and territories and religious things, none of that was even included in anything he said. His message was pretty simple, be really nice to each other and everything will be okay.\"[244]  Friendship with Andrew Wood and Eddie Vedder [ edit ]  Cornell was a close friend of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle.[144] While living together, Cornell and Wood recorded the song \"Island of Summer\",[186] which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album Melodies & Dreams, a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life.[245] Wood\\'s sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood\\'s death: \"I\\'ve always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn\\'t deal well with Andy\\'s death. After he died, numerous times I\\'d be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, \\'no, he\\'s actually dead.\\' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It\\'s facing the reality.\"[246] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter\\'s demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain\\'s suicide, Cornell said; \"When Andy died, I couldn\\'t listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason — his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as a matter of life and death — if that\\'s what you\\'re feeling at the time, then that\\'s what you\\'re going to write. It\\'s sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt\\'s case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn\\'t an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It\\'s a stream of thought, it\\'s a possibility — it\\'s definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s going to happen. But it doesn\\'t necessarily mean that it isn\\'t, either.\"[32]  Cornell was good friends with Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Cornell was one of the first people that Vedder met outside his Pearl Jam bandmates after moving to Seattle in 1990.[247] The two were neighbors for a while and had shared vocal duties in Temple of The Dog.[247] Soundgarden manager Susan Silver recalled in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at Pearl Jam (then named Mookie Blaylock)\\'s second show in Seattle, \"Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [Mookie Blaylock] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy [Andrew Wood]\\'s death… and they hadn\\'t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world - in terms of people in Seattle - and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do - to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, \\'This is your guy now\\'.\"[248][249] Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; \"Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, \"Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [Ament] and Stone [Gossard]. I give you my blessing.\" From then on he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.\"[250]  In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell was \"the best singer that we\\'ve got on the planet\".[251] About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley while introducing Cornell before performing \"Hunger Strike\" with him in September 2011; \"I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [the other members of Pearl Jam] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound.\"[252][247] The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty.[253]  Depression and substance abuse [ edit ]  Cornell struggled with depression[213][254][33][255] and had multiple addictions (mostly alcohol and prescription drugs),[32][33][20][134] which he was able to manage from roughly 1980 until 1997, when Soundgarden broke up and his first marriage was failing.[31] At that point he turned to OxyContin and other substances.[31] Cornell said about that period; \"I went through a serious crisis with depression where I didn\\'t eat a whole meal every day. I was just kind of shutting down. I eventually found that the only way out of that was to change virtually everything in my life. That was a very frightening thing to do, but it was worthwhile.\"[35] He checked into rehab in 2002[112][256][257] and quit drinking and smoking around 2005.[135][258]  Cornell stated in a 1996 interview: \"I know what it feels like to be suicidal, and I know what it feels like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don\\'t have the tolerance to create other hurdles as well.\"[259] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, \"No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You\\'ll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they\\'re hanging from a rope. It\\'s hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it\\'s just chemical. It doesn\\'t seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I\\'ve been in any kind of depression, I\\'ve over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I\\'m feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I\\'m feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them.\"[260]  In a 2006 interview, Cornell revealed that at the age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. \"I had a bad PCP [angel dust] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn\\'t telling anyone the truth. It\\'s not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, \\'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I\\'m having a bad time.\\' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I\\'d have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn\\'t have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt I could do anything I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn\\'t do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that\\'s what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn\\'t care.\"[261]  In May 2007, Cornell was honored with the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award for \"his dedication and support of the MusiCares MAP Fund and his devotion to helping other addicts with the recovery process.\" The award was presented by Alice Cooper.[262][263]  When asked how he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, \"It was a long period of coming to the realization that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it\\'s just over and over, but the bottom line is really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There\\'s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it\\'s very serious, there\\'s nothing you\\'re going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it.\"[264]  In a 2011 interview, Cornell said the major change with the reformed Soundgarden was a lack of alcohol: \"The biggest difference I noticed ... and we haven\\'t even really talked about it: there are no bottles of Jack Daniel\\'s around or beers. And we never talked about it ... it\\'s just not there.\"[265]  Death [ edit ]  Around 12:15 a.m. on May 18, 2017,[266] Cornell was found unconscious by his bodyguard in the bathroom of his hotel room at the MGM Grand in Detroit, after performing at a show with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre on May 17.[267] He was lying on the floor with an exercise band around his neck and blood in his mouth.[268] An MGM medic and EMS personnel were unable to revive Cornell.[268] Cornell was pronounced dead by a doctor at 1:30 a.m.[266] Police ruled out homicide by reviewing a hotel surveillance video, which showed nobody entering or exiting the suite after his bodyguard left at around 11:35 p.m.[269] The cause of death was determined to be suicide by hanging.[270] Cornell was 52 years old.[270] Footage of his final concert was posted on YouTube.[271] Cornell\\'s widow contacted insurance lawyer Kirk Pasich within a few minutes after her husband\\'s death in order to handle publicity.[272] Pasich became the spokesperson for Cornell\\'s widow and blamed Ativan for the singer\\'s death, stating that Cornell would not intentionally take his own life.[273][272] Cornell\\'s widow said, \"When we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different. When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him.\"[273][274]  On June 2, 2017, the Wayne County Medical Examiner released its autopsy[275] and toxicology report in the death of Cornell.[276] The coroner confirmed that the manner of death was suicide by hanging, adding his injuries were all \"consistent with hanging, partially suspended by the resistance exercise band,\"[275] and that \"drugs did not contribute\" to the cause of death.[275] Only prescription medications in therapeutic doses were found in Cornell\\'s system:[276] the sedative Butalbital (5.4 mcg/mL), commonly prescribed for the treatment of headache, four doses (41 ng/mL) of the anti-anxiety medication lorazepam (also known as Ativan), the decongestant pseudoephedrine (170 ng/mL) and its metabolite norpseudoephedrine (10 ng/mL), caffeine (from No-Doz tablets that Cornell had ingested),[276][277] along with naloxone (Narcan), used to reverse opioid overdoses, which was reportedly administered by EMTs arriving on scene.[276][278][279] No pills were found in Cornell\\'s stomach.[275] The Ativan was prescribed to Cornell in 2016.[280] Photos from Cornell\\'s hotel room[281] showed that his prescription for Ativan was \"1 tablet every 12 hours.\"[282] Following the release of the autopsy and toxicology report, Cornell\\'s widow released a statement to the press:  Many of us who know Chris well noticed that he wasn\\'t himself during his final hours and that something was very off. We have learned from this report that several substances were found in his system. After so many years of sobriety, this moment of terrible judgment seems to have completely impaired and altered his state of mind. Something clearly went terribly wrong and my children and I are heartbroken and are devastated that this moment can never be taken back. We very much appreciate all of the love we have received during this extremely difficult time and are dedicated to helping others in preventing this type of tragedy.[277]  Three weeks after his death, the music video for Cornell\\'s single \"Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart\" was removed from YouTube.[283] Released in September 2015,[284] the video depicted the singer as a death row prisoner in the Old West preparing to be hanged, but did not depict an actual successful hanging of Cornell\\'s character. His noose was sabotaged by the executioner\\'s assistant, so he survives his hanging and is forced into marriage with the woman who sabotaged his hanging. Cornell\\'s son, Christopher, also appears in the video.[283]  Cornell publicly talked about his struggle with depression, isolation and suicidal thoughts[259][260] several times throughout his life.[213][33][255][254][32][35][135][261] Following Cornell\\'s death, his brother Peter started a campaign to raise awareness on depression and suicide prevention. \"Maybe we can help spare another family the devastation,\" Peter shared on his social media.[285] A few days later, Peter revealed that he was being bullied and threatened to change the narrative of this awareness message; \"Change the message or just drop it entirely. It has reached a point where my own mental health, my sobriety and the safety of my family are at risk. And this bullying is coming from a place I never could have imagined,\" he shared before telling that he would remove himself from social media and asking his followers to keep the conversation and break through this stigma.[285] In October 2017, Peter Cornell reacted to criticism thrown at him on social media by his brother\\'s mother-in-law. He talked about the stigma surrounding mental illness and the addiction narrative being spun by his brother\\'s widow and her family to explain Cornell\\'s death, stating, \"And there is that word again. Stigma. Somehow it\\'s \"sexy\" to be an addict (of which I am also familiar), but let\\'s not talk about mental illness. Stigma. There are those who re-victimize and bully us. Taunt and demand us to re-live and tell the details of our painful upbringing. To what end? It doesn\\'t erase the damage done. It doesn\\'t turn back the hands of time. We are survivors.\"[286]  On July 11, 2017, the Detroit Police Department released the full police report,[287] photographs from Cornell\\'s hotel room,[281] and the 911 call from the MGM Grand Detroit from the night of Cornell\\'s death.[288] The call was made by a hotel employee at 12:56 a.m., reporting \"a nonresponsive guest... inside of Room 1136.\"[289] According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell\\'s bodyguard, was at the singer\\'s hotel room at 11:30 p.m. to help him with his computer, \"which was not working at that time.\" It also says that Cornell\\'s wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35 p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband \"because he did not sound like he was OK.\"[290] According to Vicky, Cornell kept saying, \"I am just tired,\" and hung up the phone.[287] A call from Cornell\\'s wife at 12:15 a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to Cornell\\'s suite to check to see if he was alright.[290][289] Kirsten told police that he was in his room watching TV when he received a phone call from Vicky. \"She sounded angry because he [Cornell] wasn\\'t responding to his phone. She told me to go to the room and check on Chris. I came to the room and was unable to get (in) because of the interior latch. I went back to my room and called for hotel security to come and open the door. They refused, saying that it wasn\\'t my room, although I told them that he was my employer and that I had a key.\"[291]  Kirsten told police that he went to Cornell\\'s room at around 12:15 a.m., but could not access the locked room. He then had a telephone conversation with Vicky Cornell. \"I told Vicky that they wouldn\\'t come open the door and she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I\\'m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet.\" Kirsten told police in a signed statement.[291][289] Kirsten said that Vicky was on the phone with him the whole time asking for updates, \"She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident.\"[291] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell\\'s neck, then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest.[289] Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate Cornell, only to no success.[290][291] Cornell was pronounced dead at around 1:30 a.m.,[291] an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell\\'s wife.[290][289][291] It is unknown how long it took for the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.[290]  Questioned by The Detroit News why it took 41 minutes to get a medical team to the scene after the bodyguard found Cornell lying on the floor, police insisted that there were no gaps.[290] Investigators looked at the length of the phone call between Cornell and his wife, and the calls the bodyguard made to security and checked video surveillance footage from the hotel hallway, and determined the timeline was accurate, and the bodyguard\\'s story checked out.[290]  On November 1, 2018, Vicky Cornell and her children filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court claiming Dr. Robert Koblin \"negligently and repeatedly\" prescribed \"dangerous mind-altering controlled substances to Chris Cornell which impaired Mr. Cornell\\'s cognition, clouded his judgment, and caused him to engage in dangerous impulsive behaviors that he was unable to control, costing him his life.\"[292] The suit claims Koblin prescribed lorazepam over a period of 20 months without seeing Chris Cornell.[292]  Memorial and tributes [ edit ]  The grave of Chris Cornell, at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.  Cornell\\'s body was cremated on May 23, 2017.[293] His funeral took place on May 26, 2017, at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.[294] Attendees and speakers at the ceremony included Soundgarden members Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron, and Ben Shepherd, as well as former members Hiro Yamamoto and Scott Sundquist, along with Audioslave\\'s Tom Morello, and Pearl Jam/Temple of the Dog members Jeff Ament and Mike McCready,[295] The mourners included friends and families as well as many notable musicians[296][297] and others.[298] The ceremony began with the cemetery\\'s speakers playing Audioslave\\'s \"Like a Stone\", as well as Cornell\\'s last solo song released before his death, \"The Promise\". Chester Bennington performed Leonard Cohen\\'s \"Hallelujah\". At the end of the funeral, Temple of the Dog\\'s song \"All Night Thing\" accompanied mourners as they exited.[298] Cornell\\'s ashes were placed next to his friend Johnny Ramone\\'s cenotaph statue[298] — Ramone is not buried there, he was cremated and his ashes were retained by his widow.[299]  Seattle\\'s Space Needle observation tower went dark from 9:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. PST on May 18, 2017, in honor of Cornell and his contributions to the city\\'s music scene.[300] In the same night, Ann Wilson paid tribute to Cornell singing Soundgarden\\'s \"Black Hole Sun\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.[301] Soundgarden\\'s drummer, Matt Cameron, was the first of Cornell\\'s former bandmates to comment on his death saying \"my dark knight is gone\" via Facebook.[302] Pearl Jam, whom Cameron also drums for, released a tribute on their website with a picture of Cornell entitled \"Chris\".[303] Cornell\\'s Audioslave bandmate, Tom Morello, wrote a poem in tribute to him.[304] Alice in Chains paid tribute with a photo of Cornell on their social media pages with the caption, \"We are heartbroken\".[305] Faith No More changed the homepage of the band\\'s official website to a tribute to Cornell after his death.[306][307] The message could still be seen on the website until November 9, 2017.[308]  The Seattle Mariners held a pregame tribute to Cornell prior to their game against the Chicago White Sox on May 19 with a moment of silence and videoboard tribute to Cornell.[309] Oakland Athletics\\'s player Trevor Plouffe changed his walk-up music to \"Black Hole Sun\" to honor Cornell.[310] Linkin Park dedicated their performance of \"One More Light\" on Jimmy Kimmel\\'s show, in tribute to Cornell.[311] During the 2017 Billboard Music Awards, Imagine Dragons\\' lead singer, Dan Reynolds, paid tribute to Cornell remembering his life and career and asking for a moment of silence as a photo of Cornell filled television screens at home and the monitors in the venue.[312]  During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Eddie Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death, saying \"he wasn\\'t just a friend, he was someone I looked up to like my older brother\" and \"I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever.\"[313] Cornell\\'s former Audioslave bandmates paid tribute to him during a Prophets of Rage concert in Berlin on June 7, playing an instrumental version of \"Like a Stone\" with a single spotlight shining down on an empty mic at center stage as the audience filled in on vocals.[314] At the Alternative Press Music Awards on July 17, the band Pierce The Veil paid tribute to Cornell with their rendition of \"Black Hole Sun\" while images of Cornell were displayed on a screen above the stage. Near the end of the performance, an audio of Cornell singing the song was played.[315]  On July 20, 2017, the day that would have been Cornell\\'s 53rd birthday, Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard, who played with Cornell in Temple of the Dog, wrote a letter to him in a post shared on Pearl Jam\\'s official website. Cornell and Gossard share the same birthday.[316]  In August 2017, Seattle-based singer Shawn Smith announced a single in tribute to Cornell, \"The Way You Made Your Garden Grow\", set to be released on his first solo vinyl album. Smith said in a statement: \"Written and recorded in loving tribute to the glorious Chris Cornell, who left us the day before this session. We will never stop singing your songs. Goodbye for now, Chris... Love Never Dies.\"[317]  Foo Fighters\\' drummer Taylor Hawkins added a tribute image of Cornell on his touring drum kit in August 2017.[318]  Cornell\\'s Soundgarden bandmate, Matt Cameron, paid homage to him in his first solo album titled Cavedweller, with the inscription \"For Chris\"[319] on the vinyl version of the album,[320] which was released on September 22, 2017.[321] Cornell heard the album two months before his death and was very supportive of Cameron\\'s solo debut.[321]  The movie American Satan, released in October 2017, paid tribute to Cornell and other artists who have died since production on the movie began with a music video featuring the band portrayed in the film, The Relentless, playing a cover of Neil Young\\'s song \"Hey Hey, My My\".[322]  During Pearl Jam\\'s first concert since Cornell\\'s death in Santiago, Chile on March 13, 2018, lead singer Eddie Vedder dedicated the song \"Come Back\" (from Pearl Jam\\'s 2006 self-titled album) to Cornell, while drummer Matt Cameron wore a T-shirt with a portrait of Cornell on the back during the show.[323]  On April 14, 2018, Cornell\\'s longtime friends Ann Wilson and Jerry Cantrell paid tribute to him during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony with a rendition of Soundgarden\\'s \"Black Hole Sun\". At the end of the performance, a photo of Cornell was displayed on a screen behind the stage and Cantrell turned around and raised his fist saluting Cornell.[324]  U2 dedicated the song \"Running to Stand Still\" to Cornell at their May 20, 2017 concert at the Rose Bowl. Before that concert began, \"Black Hole Sun\" played over the PA.[325] One year later, they saluted Cornell with a snippet of \"Black Hole Sun\" during their concert in Inglewood, Calif., on May 16, 2018.[326]  On the one year anniversary of Cornell\\'s death on May 18, 2018, Alice in Chains paid tribute to him covering two Soundgarden songs, \"Hunted Down\" and \"Boot Camp\", respectively, closing their headlining set at the Rock on the Range festival in Columbus, Ohio. Towards the end of \"Boot Camp\", the lights on stage spelled out \"CC\" for Chris Cornell and \"SG\" for Soundgarden as feedback rang out. Soundgarden was scheduled to headline the festival in 2017 prior Cornell\\'s death.[327][328] On May 20, 2018, Tool dedicated their entire set at Rock on the Range to the friends and family of Cornell.[329]  American rock band Guns N\\' Roses pay tribute to Cornell on their Not In This Lifetime... Tour. Since May 27, 2017, \"Black Hole Sun\" is played at every concert. Also, \"You Know My Name\" is the outro song of every show and gets played after the encore of the band.[330]  Alice in Chains\\' song \"Never Fade\" from their 2018 album Rainier Fog was partially inspired by Cornell\\'s death.[331]  A life-size bronze statue of Cornell was placed at Seattle Center in 2018.[332]  Connections to other singers\\' suicides [ edit ]  Music journalists noted apparently coincidental relationships between Cornell\\'s suicide and those of two other rock singers, one in the past and another shortly afterward, who also hanged themselves.[333][334]  Theodore Decker of the Columbus Dispatch, the daily newspaper in Columbus, Ohio, where Cornell was due to play his next show, noted that Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the British post-punk band, Joy Division,[333] whom Cornell had said in a 1994 Rolling Stone interview was popular with the members of Soundgarden,[32] took his life on May 18, 1980, exactly 37 years before Cornell, and by the same method as well. Curtis, known for lyrics that, as Cornell\\'s sometimes had, explored despair and depression, had become legendary as a result after his death, Decker recalled. However, Stephen Morris, one of Curtis\\'s bandmates (who later became New Order) recalled Curtis not as the \"brooding rock deity\" Decker said he became posthumously but as \"an ordinary bloke just like you or me.\" Decker recalled the other deaths of musicians who had risen from Seattle\\'s grunge scene in the early 1990s and called on Cornell\\'s fans to remember that he, too, was a human being who might still be alive if he had gotten the help he needed.[333]  Two months after Cornell\\'s death, on July 20, 2017, the day that would have been Cornell\\'s 53rd birthday, Chester Bennington, lead singer of Linkin Park, also died by suicide by hanging.[334] Bennington had been a close friend of Cornell\\'s; the two had performed together on occasion and Bennington was godfather to Cornell\\'s son Christopher.[334] Bennington also sang Leonard Cohen\\'s \"Hallelujah\" at Cornell\\'s funeral.[334] Bennington\\'s family and bandmates said he had taken Cornell\\'s death hard. Bennington\\'s Linkin Park bandmate Mike Shinoda said that the singer had been unable to complete a performance of the band\\'s song \"One More Light\", about the death of a friend, both in rehearsals and live, when they appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! shortly after Cornell\\'s death.[335]  Legacy [ edit ]  In a 1989 interview with Rolling Stone, Axl Rose declared, \"I enjoy Soundgarden. The singer [Cornell] just buries me. The guy sings so great.\"[336] Rose also stated that Cornell was the best vocalist in Rock.[337][338]  In a 2009 interview, Ronnie James Dio stated, \"I think Chris Cornell is such a great singer, and those guys [from Soundgarden] write so well and always write well — I mean, I love what he\\'s done with Audioslave and the things he\\'s done since then.\"[339]  Eddie Vedder declared in a 2009 interview that Cornell was \"the best singer that we\\'ve got on the planet.\"[251]  In April 2017, Scott Stapp stated that Cornell was \"the greatest pure Rock singer\". \"I\\'m really a huge fan of him, and everything that he has done. I just think all around that he is an extremely talented artist, songwriter, singer, and guitar player. He can do so many different things to evoke emotion. From the soulfulness, to the top end of his range when he gets metal and aggressive, to his choice of melodies and how the melody in itself, despite what he\\'s saying, can incite emotion. I think he\\'ll go down in history as one of the greats.\"[340][341]  After hearing about his death, Alice Cooper stated: \"Chris Cornell, in our circle, was known as \\'The Voice\\' because he had the best voice in rock and roll. I was lucky enough to write and record two songs with him. His death comes as a total shock to all of us. \\'Black Hole Sun\\' will live on as a classic, and his is a true legacy of rock and roll.\"[342]  Soon after Cornell\\'s death, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid added: \"There are barely any words to describe my grief over the loss of Chris Cornell...His impact as a singer, songwriter and guitarist will be felt for generations to come.\"[343]  Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: \"I\\'ve always said that Chris was the greatest songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to at different points in our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that\\'s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there\\'s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do a lot of different things with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness.\"[344]  Following his death, the sales and streams of Cornell\\'s discography grew by more than 550% from the week prior to his death. On platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora, his songs were streamed 32.5 million times during the week in which he died. The charting week prior to that, his tracks were played five million times. That same week, 38,000 copies of Cornell albums were sold, which represented a 1,700% gain in purchases; the week before his death, only 2,000 units were sold.[345] Several songs and albums by Cornell populated Billboard\\'s rock charts, including seven new entries on the Hot Rock Songs survey.[346] Cornell\\'s Hot Rock Songs presence was led at No. 7 by Soundgarden\\'s \"Black Hole Sun\", which became the band\\'s first No. 1 on the Hard Rock Digital Song Sales chart, moving 17,000 downloads (up from 1,000 the week before).[346] The song also drew 4 million U.S. streams (up from 1.3 million).[346] \"Black Hole Sun\" marked the band\\'s best rank on the Hot Rock Songs since \"Live to Rise\" peaked at No. 4 in June 2012.[346] Soundgarden\\'s \"Fell on Black Days\" (No. 16) and \"Spoonman\" (No. 19) appeared on Hot Rock Songs, along with tracks by Audioslave (\"Like a Stone\" at No. 10, \"Show Me How to Live\" at No. 21, and \"I Am the Highway\" at No. 25), and Temple of the Dog\\'s \"Hunger Strike\" at No. 18.[346] The top seven spots on Hard Rock Digital Song Sales belonged to Cornell-affiliated titles. Soundgarden\\'s Superunknown debuted at No. 5 on Top Rock Albums (17,000 units, up from 1,000).[346] Titles from Audioslave, Temple of the Dog and Cornell\\'s solo career also made various lists, including Audioslave\\'s self-titled album (No. 10, 11,000) and Soundgarden\\'s Badmotorfinger (No. 19, 7,000).[346]  Discography [ edit ]  Cornell released five solo albums.

Page Six reported in April that Miller and the soon-to-be-divorced Pitt were spotted doing some “serious flirting” at a Hollywood dinner.  But Miller told us soon after that news of their mutual attraction was “silly.”  Now The Sun reports that Miller and Pitt — whose production company, Plan B, produced her latest movie, “The Lost City Of Z” — were “seen holding hands and stroking each other during a late night party” at the Glastonbury music festival in the UK over the weekend.

       " 'Best wishes to the happy couple, Morgan Evans and Kelsea Ballerini, who have become husband and wife. The two tied the knot on Saturday (Dec. 2) during a beachside ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  According to People magazine, the bride wore a gown by Berta and bare feet down the aisle, while her Aussie groom wore a tux by Joseph Abboud. Their David Yurman rings each had customized messages engraved inside.  In a previous CMT.com interview, Ballerini said one of her favorite things about their relationship is that they bring out the best in each other.  “We’re each other’s biggest fans,” Ballerini said. “And so we’re able to be transparent with each other. And it’s cool because he has helped me with live music because he’s been touring since he was 14, and I help him with U.S. radio because I’ve been doing it for a couple of years. … We’re just able to help each other in our strengths.”  In a separate CMT.com interview, Evans said he looks forward to living a beautiful and musical life together with Ballerini.  “That’s kind of the thing in our house now,” he said, “I used to try to write the best song in the world. Now I just want to write the best song in our house that day. Then I feel like I’m doing OK.”  The two met in March 2016 while co-hosting the CMC Awards show in Australia. Ballerini wrote the title song of her current album Unapologetically about Evans three weeks after they met. Nine months after their initial introduction, Evans proposed with a custom engagement ring over breakfast at home.  “It was a special moment,” Evans told People of the proposal. “It was just right.”  “It was the sweetest thing ever,” she added.',\n",

       " 'Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single “Unforgettable,” and now Life & Style is claiming the two were all over each other during the process. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Mariah was hanging all over French. She sat on his lap, and at one point they even kissed! They weren’t trying to hide their PDA.”  A new tabloid report says there was heavy flirting going on between Mariah Carey and French Montana when the two recently collaborated in the recording studio. Gossip Cop looked into this claim about a possible hookup between the music artists, and we’ve exclusively learned the truth.  {\"position1\": {\"artist\": {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 31885, \"name\": \"Mariah Carey\"}, \"catalog_type\": \"artist\", \"description\": \"\", \"id\": 31885, \"name\": \"Mariah Carey\", \"related\": [{\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 966208, \"name\": \"Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 89006, \"name\": \"TLC\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 120430, \"name\": \"Aaliyah\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 40100, \"name\": \"Boyz II Men\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 56563, \"name\": \"Alicia Keys\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 39258, \"name\": \"Mary J.

Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet’s report is entirely “false.” We’re assured the singer wasn’t flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.  Naturally, Life & Style isn’t the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication’s latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.  Photo: AOL',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Lawrence revealed that negative reviews for mother! caused a strain in her romantic relationship with the film’s director, Darren Aronofsky.  During an interview with Adam Sandler for Variety’s Actors on Actors series, the Oscar winner revealed that Aronofsky’s reactions to the film’s negative reception became “unhealthy” for them as a couple, and they eventually called it quits in October after one year of dating.  “Normally, I promote a movie, ask people to go see it, and then it’s just out of your hands,” Lawrence, 27, said in the clip. “I normally just kind of let it go. Dating the director was different. We’d be on the [press] tour together, I’d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.”  “He comes back from the tour, and that’s all he wants to talk about and I get it,” she continued. “It’s his baby. He wrote it. He conceived it. He directed it. I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner, while also being like, ‘Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?’”  Lawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. “I finally was just like, ‘It’s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.’ Especially because it’s my man,” she said. “It’s awesome, what we did — some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it’s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.”  The American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. “They get along really well,” a source told Us at the time.  In September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: “We had energy. I had energy for him. I don’t know how he felt about me,” Lawrence told the magazine. “For the past year, I’ve been dealing with him as just a human. I’ve been in relationships before where I am just confused. And I’m never confused with him.”  The Hunger Games actress has previously dated Nicholas Hoult and Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Aronofsky was previously engaged to Rachel Weisz, with whom he shares 11-year-old son Henry.

Justin Bieber, 23, and Selena Gomez, 25, aren’t wasting any time rekindling their longtime romance. The newly reconciled pair are in search of their dream home together, according to In Touch Weekly. Justin and Selena “want a fresh start together on neutral ground. The only way they can do that is by buying a place that neither of them has lived in before,” the source admits. Now, the pair are reportedly looking to purchase a home together in either Calabasas [aka Kardashian territory] or Hidden Hills, near LA. “Finding the perfect place takes a while,” the insider says, adding, “So, the plan is to live at Selena’s until they find their dream home.”  And, it appears as though the couple couldn’t wait to shack up together, as the source says Justin’s already living in Selena’s LA home. The mag reports that there were moving vans spotted outside Sel’s mansion on Nov. 16.

       " 'Carrie Fisher had cocaine, methadone, heroin and ecstasy in her system when she died in December, according to an autopsy report released Monday.  The coroner’s report listed sleep apnea as the primary cause of death, with drug intake as a contributing factor. The report stated that Fisher’s family objected to a full autopsy, and coroner’s investigators had access to limited toxicology specimens. The conclusions were based on toxicology results and an external examination of Fisher’s body.  Fisher died on Dec. 27, four days after going into cardiac arrest on an airplane arriving at LAX from London. The report states that Fisher’s assistant was on the plane with her. The assistant reported that she was awake and normal at the beginning of the flight, but had “multiple apneic episodes, which was her baseline” during the flight. At the end of the flight, she could not be awoken.  “Based on the available toxicological information, we cannot establish the significance of the multiple substances that were detected in Ms. Fisher’s blood and tissue, with regard to the cause of death,” the report states.  According to the report, Fisher may have ingested the cocaine as early as three days before the flight, adding to the uncertainty about the cause of death. The report also notes a likely exposure to heroin, which could have suppressed her breathing as she went into cardiac arrest.  In addition to the illegal drugs, Fisher was also taking Prozac, Abilify and Lamictal under prescription. She was also taking oxycodone without a prescription.  The report also notes that Fisher had a history of bipolar disorder and a long history of drug use.  Carrie Fisher Autopsy Report by gmaddaus on Scribd',\n",

       " \"Knox CollegeGalesburg, Illinois12:13 P.M. CDTTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Galesburg! (Applause.) Well, it’s good to be home in Illinois! (Applause.) It is good to be back. It’s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Everybody, have a seat, have a seat. Well, it is good to be back.I want to, first of all, thank Knox College -- (applause) -- I want to thank Knox College and your president, Teresa Amott, for having me here today. Give Teresa a big round of applause. (Applause.) I want to thank your Congresswoman, Cheri Bustos, who’s here. (Applause.) We've got Governor Quinn here. (Applause.) I'm told we've got your Lieutenant Governor, Sheila Simon, is here. (Applause.) There she is. Attorney General Lisa Madigan is here. (Applause.)I see a bunch of my former colleagues, some folks who I haven't seen in years and I'm looking forward to saying hi to. One in particular I've got to mention, one of my favorites from the Illinois Senate -- John Sullivan is in the house. (Applause.) John was one of my earliest supporters when I was running for the U.S. Senate, and it came in really handy because he’s got, like, 10 brothers and sisters, and his wife has got 10 brothers and sisters -- (laughter) -- so they’ve got this entire precinct just in their family. (Laughter.) And they all look like John -- the brothers do -- so he doesn’t have to go to every event. He can just send one of his brothers out. (Laughter.) It is good to see him.Dick Durbin couldn’t make it today, but he sends his best. And we love Dick. (Applause.) He’s doing a great job. And we’ve got one of my favorite neighbors, the Senator from Missouri, Claire McCaskill, in the house, because we’re going to Missouri later this afternoon. (Applause.)And all of you are here, and it’s great to see you. (Applause.) And I hope everybody is having a wonderful summer. The weather is perfect. Whoever was in charge of that, good job. (Laughter.)So, eight years ago, I came here to deliver the commencement address for the class of 2005. Things were a little different back then. For example, I had no gray hair -- (laughter) -- or a motorcade. Didn’t even have a prompter. In fact, there was a problem in terms of printing out the speech because the printer didn’t work here and we had to drive it in from somewhere. (Laughter.) But it was my first big speech as your newest senator.And on the way here I was telling Cheri and Claire about how important this area was, one of the areas that I spent the most time in outside of Chicago, and how much it represented what’s best in America and folks who were willing to work hard and do right by their families. And I came here to talk about what a changing economy was doing to the middle class -- and what we, as a country, needed to do to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.See, I had just spent a year traveling the state and listening to your stories -- of proud Maytag workers losing their jobs when the plant moved down to Mexico. (Applause.) A lot of folks here remember that. Of teachers whose salaries weren’t keeping up with the rising cost of groceries. (Applause.) Of young people who had the drive and the energy, but not the money to afford a college education. (Applause.)So these were stories of families who had worked hard, believed in the American Dream, but they felt like the odds were increasingly stacked against them. And they were right. Things had changed.In the period after World War II, a growing middle class was the engine of our prosperity. Whether you owned a company, or swept its floors, or worked anywhere in between, this country offered you a basic bargain -- a sense that your hard work would be rewarded with fair wages and decent benefits, the chance to buy a home, to save for retirement, and most of all, a chance to hand down a better life for your kids.But over time, that engine began to stall -- and a lot of folks here saw it -- that bargain began to fray. Technology made some jobs obsolete. Global competition sent a lot of jobs overseas. It became harder for unions to fight for the middle class. Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to the very wealthy and smaller minimum wage increases for the working poor.And so what happened was that the link between higher productivity and people’s wages and salaries was broken. It used to be that, as companies did better, as profits went higher, workers also got a better deal. And that started changing. So the income of the top 1 percent nearly quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family’s incomes barely budged.And towards the end of those three decades, a housing bubble, credit cards, a churning financial sector was keeping the economy artificially juiced up, so sometimes it papered over some of these long-term trends. But by the time I took office in 2009 as your President, we all know the bubble had burst, and it cost millions of Americans their jobs, and their homes, and their savings. And I know a lot of folks in this area were hurt pretty bad. And the decades-long erosion that had been taking place -- the erosion of middle-class security -- was suddenly laid bare for everybody to see.Now, today, five years after the start of that Great Recession, America has fought its way back. (Applause.) We fought our way back. Together, we saved the auto industry; took on a broken health care system. (Applause.) We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled wind and solar power. (Applause.) Together, we put in place tough new rules on the big banks, and protections to crack down on the worst practices of mortgage lenders and credit card companies. (Applause.) We changed a tax code too skewed in favor of the wealthiest at the expense of working families -- so we changed that, and we locked in tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, and we asked those at the top to pay a little bit more. (Applause.)So you add it all up, and over the past 40 months, our businesses have created 7.2 million new jobs. This year, we’re off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.And because we bet on this country, suddenly foreign companies are, too. Right now, more of Honda’s cars are made in America than anyplace else on Earth. (Applause.) Airbus, the European aircraft company, they’re building new planes in Alabama. (Applause.) And American companies like Ford are replacing outsourcing with insourcing -- they’re bringing jobs back home. (Applause.)We sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before. We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth. We’re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years. (Applause.) The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years. (Applause.) And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. (Applause.)So thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- we’ve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis. We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right? A lot of us tightened our belts, shed debt, maybe cut up a couple of credit cards, refocused on those things that really matter.As a country, we’ve recovered faster and gone further than most other advanced nations in the world. With new American revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised to reverse the forces that battered the middle class for so long, and start building an economy where everyone who works hard can get ahead.But -- and here's the big “but” -- I’m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do. Even though our businesses are creating new jobs and have broken record profits, nearly all the income gains of the past 10 years have continued to flow to the top 1 percent. The average CEO has gotten a raise of nearly 40 percent since 2009. The average American earns less than he or she did in 1999. And companies continue to hold back on hiring those who’ve been out of work for some time.Today, more students are earning their degree, but soaring costs saddle them with unsustainable debt. Health care costs are slowing down, but a lot of working families haven’t seen any of those savings yet. The stock market rebound helped a lot of families get back much of what they had lost in their 401(k)s, but millions of Americans still have no idea how they’re going to be able to retire.So in many ways, the trends that I spoke about here in 2005 -- eight years ago -- the trend of a winner-take-all economy where a few are doing better and better and better, while everybody else just treads water -- those trends have been made worse by the recession. And that's a problem.This growing inequality not just of result, inequality of opportunity -- this growing inequality is not just morally wrong, it’s bad economics. Because when middle-class families have less to spend, guess what, businesses have fewer consumers. When wealth concentrates at the very top, it can inflate unstable bubbles that threaten the economy. When the rungs on the ladder of opportunity grow farther and farther apart, it undermines the very essence of America -- that idea that if you work hard you can make it here.And that’s why reversing these trends has to be Washington’s highest priority. (Applause.) It has to be Washington's highest priority. (Applause.) It’s certainly my highest priority. (Applause.)Unfortunately, over the past couple of years, in particular, Washington hasn’t just ignored this problem; too often, Washington has made things worse. (Applause.)And I have to say that -- because I'm looking around the room -- I've got some friends here not just who are Democrats, I've got some friends here who are Republicans -- (applause) -- and I worked with in the state legislature and they did great work. But right now, what we’ve got in Washington, we've seen a sizable group of Republican lawmakers suggest that they wouldn’t vote to pay the very bills that Congress rang up. And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery in 2011 and we can't afford to repeat that.Then, rather than reduce our deficits with a scalpel -- by cutting out programs we don’t need, fixing ones that we do need that maybe are in need of reform, making government more efficient -- instead of doing that, we've got folks who’ve insisted on leaving in place a meat cleaver called the sequester that's cost jobs. It's harmed growth. It's hurt our military. It's gutted investments in education and science and medical research. (Applause.)Almost every credible economist will tell you it's been a huge drag on this recovery. And it means that we're underinvesting in the things that this country needs to make it a magnet for good jobs.Then, over the last six months, this gridlock has gotten worse. I didn't think that was possible. (Laughter.) The good news is a growing number of Republican senators are looking to join their Democratic counterparts and try to get things done in the Senate. So that's good news. (Applause.) For example, they worked together on an immigration bill that economists say will boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars, strengthen border security, make the system work.But you've got a faction of Republicans in the House who won’t even give that bill a vote. And that same group gutted a farm bill that America’s farmers depend on, but also America's most vulnerable children depend on.AUDIENCE MEMBER: Booo --THE PRESIDENT: And if you ask some of these folks, some of these folks mostly in the House, about their economic agenda how it is that they'll strengthen the middle class, they’ll shift the topic to “out-of-control government spending” –- despite the fact that we've cut the deficit by nearly half as a share of the economy since I took office. (Applause.)Or they’ll talk about government assistance for the poor, despite the fact that they’ve already cut early education for vulnerable kids. They've already cut insurance for people who’ve lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Or they’ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery when there was no Obamacare. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: My daughter has insurance now!THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. (Applause.) That’s what this is about. That’s what this is about. (Applause.) That’s what we've been fighting for.But with this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington has taken its eye off the ball. And I am here to say this needs to stop. (Applause.) This needs to stop.This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you, the people we represent. That’s what we have to spend our time on and our energy on and our focus on. (Applause.)And as Washington prepares to enter another budget debate, the stakes for our middle class and everybody who is fighting to get into the middle class could not be higher. The countries that are passive in the face of a global economy, those countries will lose the competition for good jobs. They will lose the competition for high living standards. That’s why America has to make the investments necessary to promote long-term growth and shared prosperity -- rebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks. (Applause.) That’s what we need to be talking about. That’s what Washington needs to be focused on.And that’s why, over the next several weeks, in towns across this country, I will be engaging the American people in this debate. (Applause.) I'll lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class in America, and what it takes to work your way into the middle class in America: Job security, with good wages and durable industries. A good education. A home to call your own. Affordable health care when you get sick. (Applause.) A secure retirement even if you’re not rich. Reducing poverty. Reducing inequality. Growing opportunity. That’s what we need. (Applause.) That’s what we need. That’s what we need right now. That’s what we need to be focused on. (Applause.)Now, some of these ideas I’ve talked about before. Some of the ideas I offer will be new. Some will require Congress. Some I will pursue on my own. (Applause.) Some ideas will benefit folks right away. Some will take years to fully implement. But the key is to break through the tendency in Washington to just bounce from crisis to crisis. What we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan; we need a long-term American strategy, based on steady, persistent effort, to reverse the forces that have conspired against the middle class for decades. That has to be our project. (Applause.)Now, of course, we’ll keep pressing on other key priorities. I want to get this immigration bill done. We still need to work on reducing gun violence. (Applause.) We’ve got to continue to end the war in Afghanistan, rebalance our fight against al Qaeda. (Applause.) We need to combat climate change. We’ve got to standing up for civil rights. We’ve got to stand up for women’s rights. (Applause.)So all those issues are important, and we’ll be fighting on every one of those issues. But if we don’t have a growing, thriving middle class then we won’t have the resources to solve a lot of these problems. We won’t have the resolve, the optimism, the sense of unity that we need to solve many of these other issues.Now, in this effort, I will look to work with Republicans as well as Democrats wherever I can. And I sincerely believe that there are members of both parties who understand this moment, understand what’s at stake, and I will welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum. But I will not allow gridlock, or inaction, or willful indifference to get in our way. (Applause.)That means whatever executive authority I have to help the middle class, I’ll use it. (Applause.) Where I can’t act on my own and Congress isn’t cooperating, I’ll pick up the phone -- I’ll call CEOs; I’ll call philanthropists; I’ll call college presidents; I’ll call labor leaders. I’ll call anybody who can help -- and enlist them in our efforts. (Applause.)Because the choices that we, the people, make right now will determine whether or not every American has a fighting chance in the 21st century. And it will lay the foundation for our children’s future, our grandchildren’s future, for all Americans.So let me give you a quick preview of what I’ll be fighting for and why. The first cornerstone of a strong, growing middle class has to be, as I said before, an economy that generates more good jobs in durable, growing industries. That's how this area was built. That's how America prospered. Because anybody who was willing to work, they could go out there and they could find themselves a job, and they could build a life for themselves and their family.Now, over the past four years, for the first time since the 1990s, the number of American manufacturing jobs has actually gone up instead of down. That's the good news. (Applause.) But we can do more. So I’m going to push new initiatives to help more manufacturers bring more jobs back to the United States. (Applause.) We’re going to continue to focus on strategies to make sure our tax code rewards companies that are not shipping jobs overseas, but creating jobs right here in the United States of America. (Applause.)We want to make sure that -- we’re going to create strategies to make sure that good jobs in wind and solar and natural gas that are lowering costs and, at the same time, reducing dangerous carbon pollution happen right here in the United States. (Applause.)And something that Cheri and I were talking about on the way over here -- I’m going to be pushing to open more manufacturing innovation institutes that turn regions left behind by global competition into global centers of cutting-edge jobs. So let’s tell the world that America is open for business. (Applause.) I know there’s an old site right here in Galesburg, over on Monmouth Boulevard -- let’s put some folks to work. (Applause.)Tomorrow, I’ll also visit the Port of Jacksonville, Florida to offer new ideas for doing what America has always done best, which is building things. Pat and I were talking before I came -- backstage -- Pat Quinn -- he was talking about how I came over the Don Moffitt Bridge. (Applause.) But we’ve got work to do all across the country. We’ve got ports that aren’t ready for the new supertankers that are going to begin passing through the new Panama Canal in two years’ time. If we don’t get that done, those tankers are going to go someplace else. We’ve got more than 100,000 bridges that are old enough to qualify for Medicare. (Laughter and applause.)Businesses depend on our transportation systems, on our power grids, on our communications networks. And rebuilding them creates good-paying jobs right now that can’t be outsourced. (Applause.)And by the way, this isn’t a Democratic idea. Republicans built a lot of stuff. This is the Land of Lincoln. Lincoln was all about building stuff -- first Republican President. (Applause.) And yet, as a share of our economy, we invest less in our infrastructure than we did two decades ago. And that’s inefficient at a time when it’s as cheap as it’s been since the 1950s to build things. It’s inexcusable at a time when so many of the workers who build stuff for a living are sitting at home waiting for a call.The longer we put this off, the more expensive it will be and the less competitive we will be. Businesses of tomorrow will not locate near old roads and outdated ports. They’ll relocate to places with high-speed Internet, and high-tech schools, and systems that move air and auto traffic faster, and not to mention will get parents home quicker from work because we’ll be eliminating some of these traffic jams. And we can watch all of that happen in other countries, and start falling behind, or we can choose to make it happen right here, in the United States. (Applause.)In an age when jobs know no borders, companies are also going to seek out the countries that boast the most talented citizens, and they’ll reward folks who have the skills and the talents they need -- they’ll reward those folks with good pay.The days when the wages for a worker with a high school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody who got some sort of higher education -- those days are over. Everybody here knows that. There are a whole bunch of folks here whose dads or grandpas worked at a plant, didn’t need a high school education. You could just go there. If you were willing to work hard, you might be able to get two jobs. And you could support your family, have a vacation, own your home. But technology and global competition, they’re not going away. Those old days aren’t coming back.So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to diminishing living standards, or we can do what America has always done, which is adapt, and pull together, and fight back, and win. That’s what we have to do. (Applause.)And that brings me to the second cornerstone of a strong middle class -- and everybody here knows it -- an education that prepares our children and our workers for the global competition that they’re going to face. (Applause.) And if you think education is expensive, wait until you see how much ignorance costs in the 21st century. (Laughter and applause.)If we don’t make this investment, we’re going to put our kids, our workers, and our country at a competitive disadvantage for decades. So we have to begin in the earliest years. And that’s why I’m going to keep pushing to make high-quality preschool available for every 4-year-old in America. (Applause.) Not just because we know it works for our kids, but because it provides a vital support system for working parents.And I’m going to take action in the education area to spur innovation that don’t require Congress. (Applause.) So, today, for example, as we speak, federal agencies are moving on my plan to connect 99 percent of America’s students to high-speed Internet over the next five years. We’re making that happen right now. (Applause.) We’ve already begun meeting with business leaders and tech entrepreneurs and innovative educators to identify the best ideas for redesigning our high schools so that they teach the skills required for a high-tech economy.And we’re also going to keep pushing new efforts to train workers for changing jobs. So here in Galesburg, for example, a lot of the workers that were laid off at Maytag chose to enroll in retraining programs like the one at Carl Sandburg College. (Applause.) And while it didn’t pay off for everyone, a lot of the folks who were retrained found jobs that suited them even better and paid even more than the ones they had lost.And that’s why I’ve asked Congress to start a Community College to Career initiative, so that workers can earn the skills that high-tech jobs demand without leaving their hometown. (Applause.) And I’m going to challenge CEOs from some of America’s best companies to hire more Americans who’ve got what it takes to fill that job opening but have been laid off for so long that nobody is giving their résumé an honest look.AUDIENCE MEMBER: More talent!THE PRESIDENT: That, too.I’m also going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that’s straining the budgets of just about every American family -- and that’s the soaring cost of higher education. (Applause.) Everybody is touched by this, including your President, who had a whole bunch of loans he had to pay off. (Laughter.)Three years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars stopped padding the pockets of big banks, and instead helped more kids afford college. (Applause.) Then, I capped loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers, so that if somebody graduated and they decided to take a teaching job, for example, that didn’t pay a lot of money, they knew that they were never going to have to pay more than 10 percent of their income and they could afford to go into a profession that they loved. That’s in place right now. (Applause.) And this week, we’re working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because of congressional inaction. (Applause.)So this is all a good start -- but it isn’t enough. Families and taxpayers can’t just keep paying more and more and more into an undisciplined system where costs just keep on going up and up and up. We’ll never have enough loan money, we’ll never have enough grant money, to keep up with costs that are going up 5, 6, 7 percent a year. We’ve got to get more out of what we pay for.Now, some colleges are testing new approaches to shorten the path to a degree, or blending teaching with online learning to help students master material and earn credits in less time. In some states, they’re testing new ways to fund college based not just on how many students enroll, but how many of them graduate, how well did they do.So this afternoon, I’ll visit the University of Central Missouri to highlight their efforts to deliver more bang for the buck to their students. And in the coming months, I will lay out an aggressive strategy to shake up the system, tackle rising costs, and improve value for middle-class students and their families. It is critical that we make sure that college is affordable for every single American who’s willing to work for it. (Applause.)Now, so you’ve got a good job; you get a good education -- those have always been the key stepping stones into the middle class. But a home of your own has always been the clearest expression of middle-class security. For most families, that’s your biggest asset. For most families, that’s where your life’s work has been invested. And that changed during the crisis, when we saw millions of middle-class families experience their home values plummeting. The good news is over the past four years, we’ve helped more responsible homeowners stay in their homes. And today, sales are up and prices are up, and fewer Americans see their homes underwater.But we’re not done yet. The key now is to encourage homeownership that isn’t based on unrealistic bubbles, but instead is based on a solid foundation, where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules, rules that are clear and transparent and fair.So already, I’ve asked Congress to pass a really good, bipartisan idea -- one that was championed, by the way, by Mitt Romney’s economic advisor -- and this is the idea to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage while rates are still low so they can save thousands of dollars a year. (Applause.) It will be like a tax cut for families who can refinance.I’m also acting on my own to cut red tape for responsible families who want to get a mortgage but the bank is saying no. We’ll work with both parties to turn the page on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and build a housing finance system that’s rock-solid for future generations.So we’ve got more work to do to strengthen homeownership in this country. But along with homeownership, the fourth cornerstone of what it means to be middle class in this country is a secure retirement. (Applause.) I hear from too many people across the country, face to face or in letters that they send me, that they feel as if retirement is just receding from their grasp. It’s getting farther and farther away. They can't see it.Now, today, a rising stock market has millions of retirement balances going up, and some of the losses that had taken place during the financial crisis have been recovered. But we still live with an upside-down system where those at the top, folks like me, get generous tax incentives to save, while tens of millions of hardworking Americans who are struggling, they get none of those breaks at all. So as we work to reform our tax code, we should find new ways to make it easier for workers to put away money, and free middle-class families from the fear that they won't be able to retire. (Applause.)And if Congress is looking for a bipartisan place to get started, I should just say they don’t have to look far. We mentioned immigration reform before. Economists show that immigration reform makes undocumented workers pay their full share of taxes, and that actually shores up the Social Security system for years. So we should get that done. (Applause.)Good job; good education for your kids; home of your own; secure retirement.Fifth, I'm going to keep focusing on health care -- (applause) -- because middle-class families and small business owners deserve the security of knowing that neither an accident or an illness is going to threaten the dreams that you’ve worked a lifetime to build.As we speak, we're well on our way to fully implementing the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) We're going to implement it. Now, if you’re one of the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance either through the job or Medicare or Medicaid, you don’t have to do anything, but you do have new benefits and better protections than you did before. You may not know it, but you do. Free checkups, mammograms, discounted medicines if you're on Medicare -- that’s what the Affordable Care Act means. You're already getting a better deal. No lifetime limits.If you don’t have health insurance, then starting on October 1st, private plans will actually compete for your business, and you'll be able to comparison-shop online. There will be a marketplace online, just like you’d buy a flat-screen TV or plane tickets or anything else you're doing online, and you'll be able to buy an insurance package that fits your budget and is right for you.And if you're one of the up to half of all Americans who’ve been sick or have a preexisting condition -- if you look at this auditorium, about half of you probably have a preexisting condition that insurance companies could use to not give you insurance if you lost your job or lost your insurance -- well, this law means that beginning January 1st, insurance companies will finally have to cover you and charge you the same rates as everybody else, even if you have a preexisting condition. (Applause.) That’s what the Affordable Care Act does. That’s what it does. (Applause.)Now, look, I know because I've been living it that there are folks out there who are actively working to make this law fail. And I don’t always understand exactly what their logic is here, why they think giving insurance to folks who don’t have it and making folks with insurance a little more secure, why they think that’s a bad thing. But despite the politically motivated misinformation campaign, the states that have committed themselves to making this law work are finding that competition and choice are actually pushing costs down.So just last week, New York announced that premiums for consumers who buy their insurance in these online marketplaces will be at least 50 percent lower than what they're paying today -- 50 percent lower. (Applause.) So folks' premiums in the individual market will drop by 50 percent. And for them and for the millions of Americans who’ve been able to cover their sick kids for the first time -- like this gentlemen who just said his daughter has got health insurance -- or have been able to cover their employees more cheaply, or are able to have their kids who are younger than -- who are 25 or 26 stay on their parents' plan -- (applause) -- for all those folks, you'll have the security of knowing that everything you’ve worked hard for is no longer one illness away from being wiped out. (Applause.)Finally, as we work to strengthen these cornerstones of middle-class security -- good job with decent wages and benefits, a good education, home of your own, retirement security, health care security -- I’m going to make the case for why we've got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for all those Americans who haven't quite made it yet -- who are working hard but are still suffering poverty wages, who are struggling to get full-time work. (Applause.)There are a lot of folks who are still struggling out here, too many people in poverty. Here in America, we’ve never guaranteed success -- that's not what we do. More than some other countries, we expect people to be self-reliant. Nobody is going to do something for you. (Applause.) We've tolerated a little more inequality for the sake of a more dynamic, more adaptable economy. That's all for the good. But that idea has always been combined with a commitment to equality of opportunity to upward mobility -- the idea that no matter how poor you started, if you're willing to work hard and discipline yourself and defer gratification, you can make it, too. That's the American idea. (Applause.)Unfortunately, opportunities for upward mobility in America have gotten harder to find over the past 30 years. And that’s a betrayal of the American idea. And that’s why we have to do a lot more to give every American the chance to work their way into the middle class.The best defense against all of these forces -- global competition, economic polarization -- is the strength of the community. So we need a new push to rebuild rundown neighborhoods. (Applause.) We need new partnerships with some of the hardest-hit towns in America to get them back on their feet. And because no one who works full-time in America should have to live in poverty, I am going to keep making the case that we need to raise the minimum wage -- (applause) -- because it's lower right now than it was when Ronald Reagan took office. It's time for the minimum wage to go up. (Applause.)We're not a people who allow chance of birth to decide life’s biggest winners or losers. And after years in which we’ve seen how easy it can be for any of us to fall on hard times -- folks in Galesburg, folks in the Quad Cities, you know there are good people who work hard and sometimes they get a bad break. A plant leaves. Somebody gets sick. Somebody loses a home. We've seen it in our family, in our friends and our neighbors. We've seen it happen. And that means we cannot turn our backs when bad breaks hit any of our fellow citizens.So good jobs; a better bargain for the middle class and the folks who are working to get into the middle class; an economy that grows from the middle out, not the top down -- that's where I will focus my energies. (Applause.) That's where I will focus my energies not just for the next few months, but for the remainder of my presidency.These are the plans that I'll lay out across this country. But I won’t be able to do it alone, so I'm going to be calling on all of us to take up this cause. We’ll need our businesses, who are some of the best in the world, to pressure Congress to invest in our future. And I’ll be asking our businesses to set an example by providing decent wages and salaries to their own employees. And I’m going to highlight the ones that do just that.There are companies like Costco, which pays good wages and offers good benefits. (Applause.) Companies like -- there are companies like the Container Store, that prides itself on training its employees and on employee satisfaction -- because these companies prove that it’s not just good for the employees, it’s good for their businesses to treat workers well. It’s good for America. (Applause.)So I’m going to be calling on the private sector to step up. I will be saying to Democrats we’ve got to question some of our old assumptions. We’ve got to be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don't work as well as they should. (Applause.) We’ve got to be willing to -- we’ve got to embrace changes to cherished priorities so that they work better in this new age. We can't just -- Democrats can't just stand pat and just defend whatever government is doing. If we believe that government can give the middle class a fair shot in this new century -- and I believe that -- we’ve an obligation to prove it. And that means that we’ve got to be open to new ways of doing things.And we’ll need Republicans in Congress to set aside short-term politics and work with me to find common ground. (Applause.)It’s interesting, in the run-up to this speech, a lot of reporters say that, well, Mr. President, these are all good ideas, but some of you’ve said before; some of them sound great, but you can't get those through Congress. Republicans won’t agree with you. And I say, look, the fact is there are Republicans in Congress right now who privately agree with me on a lot of the ideas I’ll be proposing. I know because they’ve said so. But they worry they’ll face swift political retaliation for cooperating with me.Now, there are others who will dismiss every idea I put forward either because they’re playing to their most strident supporters, or in some cases because, sincerely, they have a fundamentally different vision for America -- one that says inequality is both inevitable and just; one that says an unfettered free market without any restraints inevitably produces the best outcomes, regardless of the pain and uncertainty imposed on ordinary families; and government is the problem and we should just shrink it as small as we can.In either case, I say to these members of Congress: I’m laying out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot. So now it’s time for you to lay out your ideas. (Applause.) You can't just be against something. You got to be for something. (Applause.)Even if you think I’ve done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office. So it’s not enough for you just to oppose me. You got to be for something. What are your ideas? If you’re willing to work with me to strengthen American manufacturing and rebuild this country’s infrastructure, let’s go. If you’ve got better ideas to bring down the cost of college for working families, let’s hear them. If you think you have a better plan for making sure that every American has the security of quality, affordable health care, then stop taking meaningless repeal votes, and share your concrete ideas with the country. (Applause.)Repealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It’s not.If you’re serious about a balanced, long-term fiscal plan that replaces the mindless cuts currently in place, or if you’re interested in tax reform that closes corporate loopholes and gives working families a better deal, I’m ready to work. (Applause.) But you should know that I will not accept deals that don’t meet the basic test of strengthening the prospects of hardworking families. This is the agenda we have to be working on. (Applause.)We’ve come a long way since I first took office. (Applause.) As a country, we’re older and wiser. I don’t know if I’m wiser, but I’m certainly older. (Laughter.) And as long as Congress doesn’t manufacture another crisis -- as long as we don’t shut down the government just because I’m for keeping it open -- (laughter) -- as long as we don’t risk a U.S. default over paying bills that we’ve already racked up, something that we’ve never done -- we can probably muddle along without taking bold action. If we stand pat and we don’t do any of the things I talked about, our economy will grow, although slower than it should. New businesses will form. The unemployment rate will probably tick down a little bit. Just by virtue of our size and our natural resources and, most of all, because of the talent of our people, America will remain a world power, and the majority of us will figure out how to get by.But you know what, that’s our choice. If we just stand by and do nothing in the face of immense change, understand that part of our character will be lost. Our founding precepts about wide-open opportunity, each generation doing better than the last -- that will be a myth, not reality. The position of the middle class will erode further. Inequality will continue to increase. Money’s power will distort our politics even more.Social tensions will rise, as various groups fight to hold on to what they have, or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn’t improving. And the fundamental optimism that’s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia.And that’s not the vision I have for this country. It’s not the vision you have for this country. That’s not the America we know. That’s not the vision we should be settling for. That’s not a vision we should be passing on to our children.I have now run my last campaign. I do not intend to wait until the next campaign or the next President before tackling the issues that matter. I care about one thing and one thing only, and that’s how to use every minute -- (applause) -- the only thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term -- (laughter) -- to make this country work for working Americans again. (Applause.) That’s all I care about. I don’t have another election. (Applause.)Because I’ll tell you, Galesburg, that’s where I believe America needs to go. I believe that’s where the American people want to go. And it may seem hard today, but if we’re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we’ve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now. It will be stronger five years from now. It will be stronger 10 years from now. (Applause.)If we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck. More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to “Open” on their own business. More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. (Applause.)And in the end, isn't that what makes us special? It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness. (Applause.) We haven’t just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. (Applause.)When we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for “number one.” Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values? That’s why we don’t call it John’s dream or Susie’s dream or Barack’s dream or Pat's dream -- we call it the American Dream. And that’s what makes this country special -- the idea that no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can make it if you try. (Applause.) That’s what we're fighting for.So, yes, Congress is tough right now, but that’s not going to stop me. We're going to do everything we can, wherever we can, with or without Congress, to make things happen. We're going to go on the road and talk to you, and you'll have ideas, and we want to see which ones we can implement. But we're going to focus on this thing that matters.One of America’s greatest writers, Carl Sandburg, born right here in Galesburg over a century ago -- (applause) -- he saw the railroads bring the world to the prairie, and then the prairie sent out its bounty to the world. And he saw the advent of new industries, new technologies, and he watched populations shift. He saw fortunes made and lost. And he saw how change could be painful -- how a new age could unsettle long-held customs and ways of life. But he had that frontier optimism, and so he saw something more on the horizon. And he wrote, “I speak of new cities and new people. The past is a bucket of ashes. Yesterday is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west. There is only an ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows.”Well, America, we’ve made it through the worst of yesterday’s winds. We just have to have the courage to keep moving forward. We've got to set our eyes on the horizon. We will find an ocean of tomorrows. We will find a sky of tomorrows for the American people and for this great country that we love.So thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)END1:17 P.M. CDT\",\n",

The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'\",\n",

       " 'When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna. Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing—who can forget last year’s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?—this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt—exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. “Coachella should always be fun and disruptive,” shared Weaver via email. “We had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?”  when u finna run outta hangers. A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 16, 2018 at 9:06am PDT  Upping the ante meant entering the planning stage early. Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February’s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele’s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. “Ri and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,” says Weaver. “So we started to think of what’s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.” The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: “It was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.”  Advertisement  extra af. #chella18 A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 15, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  Making these unique pieces work requires styling magic and foresight, and Weaver gives credit where it’s due. “I have an amazing assistant Amir that really helps me stay organised and calm which allows me to just focus on all these crazy ideas,” he says. Though he’s mum on when we’ll see the next jaw-dropping Rihanna outfit, their partnership ensures plenty of great fashion on the horizon. “What I love about Ri is that she’s such a non-conformist, which pushes your boundaries of creativity,” says Weaver. “Nothing is off limits.”  This article was originally published on Vogue.com.',\n",
       " 'Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  “Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”  “They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.  “The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”  For more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

       " '26.6k SHARES Share TweetIt turns out that our moon isn’t alone out there, orbiting our planet on its own. Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.The ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth’s companion for centuries to come.”SourceLike this: Like Loading...',\n",

Jennifer Aniston and her hunky boyfriend Justin Theroux were seen out in Los Angeles last night, enjoying the company of Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson.  So what does a foursome like this one do for fun?\",\n",
       " \"My mother, and the mothers of my friends in single-parent families, were the first inspirational group of women I knew. The majority of fathers that I saw when I was growing up in Vancouver didn't take the responsibility to look after their kids and I was aware that society is geared towards punishing single women. Because my mother didn't have someone else there, she had to give both her kids a lot more responsibility, which allowed me to deal with being an adult quicker.  I've always felt more comfortable in the company of women, and as far as girlfriends go, they've each been a learning experience. You meet someone at a certain point in your life, then break apart, but you always share that time. And you'll run into each other years later to find you have nothing in common, but you'll always have that mutual experience - that moment.  I wish I could still believe in the Romeo and Juliet way but it doesn't seem to work. I only believe in lust at first sight. Love takes much longer to develop, and it's constantly renewing. As an actor, it's always an odd occasion when you're building that false romance with someone, because the only way I've learnt to do it is to actually fall in love a bit. When you're playing those parts, you have to open yourself up to someone in the way you would to a lover, so you do emotionally connect. That's one of the bizarre aspects of our business - you build these incredibly intense relationships with people and then when the film's finished you all part ways and never see each other again. Everyone goes back to paying their bills and looking after their babies, and the film is just this little memory of sunlight.  I've worked with some brilliant actresses who teach by doing, not by saying, and through working on a TV show for six years I actually grew up with some amazing women. Katie [Holmes], at the beginning of Dawson's Creek was so natural - she'd never really worked before, so the words would go in her ear and come out her mouth with no filter and it was beautiful to watch. On Bobby I worked with an amazing group of women - Demi Moore, Helen Hunt, Sharon Stone, Heather Graham, Joy Bryant. And each represented a different thing.  Actresses have to be quite galvanised, so I meet women who are really headstrong. I find that strength attractive - I like a woman who can argue - I live in LA, and there are a lot of pretty, stupid women. My sister's very strong-headed too, which can be a pain in my ass I'll admit, but I'm from a family where you're not only expected to have an opinion but be able to defend it.  I have lots of hard-earned knowledge about women through heartbreak, and social faux pas. When I was about 15, thinking I was engaging in light conversation, I asked a woman when she was due. Of course, she wasn't pregnant. I learnt the lesson never to ask again. As a leading man you don't ask a woman's age, and you don't care about her natural hair colour or her weight.  There'll always be sexual tension between male and female friends - we're animals after all, wired to accept each other on a sexual level at all times. Of course we all agree to a variety of social restraints, but it doesn't mean the basic impulses aren't there, and I don't think sex is an unhealthy impulse. It's only when you try to hide and subvert it that it manifests itself in ugly ways.  Part of post-feminism, I think, is women taking responsibility for themselves, and for doing what makes them happy. I think there's more progress to be made, but I don't think many of us are raised with those sexist ideals about women any more. I think we're moving towards equality. But, you know, I have a 23-year-old sister, so I have to believe that things are changing. I have to.  · Joshua Jackson's latest film, Bobby, is out now\",\n",
       " 'ABC has ordered a second season of hit singing competition series American Idol, with Ryan Seacrest and judges Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie set to return.  American Idol, once the biggest show on television during its heyday on Fox, has not been a runaway ratings hit in its return. The ABC incarnation posted a series of ratings declines after the premiere and hit multiple franchise all-time lows before recently rebounding with the start of the live shows. It also was regularly topped by rival NBC singling competition The Voice on Monday. Still, American Idol is on track to finish as Sunday’s No. 1 entertainment broadcast series on each of its 8 telecasts this season in Live + Same Day Adults 18-49. On average, the series ranks No. 1 in its 2-hour slot with Adults 18-49, Adults 18-34, across all key Women and Teens 12-17.  “We knew that American Idol on ABC would unleash an opportunity for singers from all walks of life to realize their dreams and that these incredible contestants would have America rooting for their success,” said Channing Dungey, president, ABC Entertainment. “I am thrilled that Katy, Luke, Lionel and Ryan will be back to once again embark on this Idol journey with us to discover the next crop of inspiring talent.”  ABC’s pickup of the singing competition ended a long saga of getting American Idol back on TV when the network closed a deal last year with FremantleMedia North America and CORE Media Group’s 19 Entertainment for a revival, two seasons after it ended its 15-season run on Fox. ABC then spent reported $20 million to lock in Perry as a judge.  “American Idol’’s return on ABC has shown once again that viewers love to discover and support raw talent,” said Trish Kinane, president of Entertainment Programming, FremantleMedia North America, executive producer and showrunner of American Idol. “Our new judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have brought huge credibility, energy and fun to the show this year, and we are so excited to continue the journey with Ryan Seacrest at the helm in the search for the next superstar.”  Idol’s relaunch on ABC was overshadowed by the sexual harassment allegations against Seacrest that resurfaces in the week leading to the show’s debut. ABC has stood by the veteran Idol host.  The top 7 finalists take the stage this Sunday in the live coast-to-coast broadcast at 8:00-10:00 p.m. EDT/7:00-9:00 p.m. CDT/5:00-7:00 p.m. PDT. (The episode will be rebroadcast for the West Coast at 8:00-10:00 p.m. PDT).',\n",

       " 'In the immortal words of Hilary Duff, “Let’s go back, back to the beginning.” January 2016 played host to a series of Kardashian-Jenner-West-Rose-Chyna feuds that have been years in the making.  From “cool pants” to clover emojis, there’s a lot of backstory that needs explaining in order to completely understand everything that went down among Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna.  To keep you informed, Us Weekly has broken it down with a comprehensive timeline of events.  Kanye West Dates Amber Rose  In 2008, the Grammy-winning rapper started a relationship with unknown model Rose after spotting her in Ludacris’ “What Them Girls Like” music video. The pair had a public two-year romance.  Amber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West  In mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, “[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn’t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he’s remorseful for how he treated me.”  Blac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged  Meanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. “Most amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,” Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna’s giant diamond ring.  Kanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian  Fresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian’s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!).  Kanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose  As West’s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fiancé, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song “Cold” in which he rapped, “Only n—a I got respect for is Wiz / And I’ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.”  Amber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian  In February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn’t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary.  North West Is Born  Following a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song “Only One” for his little girl.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side.  Kanye West Marries Kim Kardashian  After gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014.  Rob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar  Things got awkward when Kim’s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim’s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family’s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He’s stayed out of the public eye ever since. “He sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,” Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. “There was no fight.”  Blac Chyna and Tyga Split  In August 2014, the parents called it quits. “They are trying to keep it amicable,” an insider told Us Weekly at the time. “They also have a lot of friends in common — Tyga is Kanye [West’s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] — so they don’t want to make it weird.”  Amber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa  Despite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa “for the rest of my life,” Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. “I never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,” Rose tweeted several weeks later.  Tyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner  In the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner’s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner’s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance.  Amber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga  Fresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner’s relationship with Tyga. “She’s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o’clock and relax,” Rose said of Jenner. “That’s ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.”  Khloé Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose  Not willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khloé Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. “’I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,’ Amber Rose told Foxx. Please don’t worry about my sister who has a career & her s–t together at ONLY 17 people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones,” Khloé tweeted, making note of Rose’s past as a stripper. “Please stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you.” Her comments prompted an intense back-and-forth between the two.  Kanye West Gets Involved in Twitter Feud  Rose responded to Khloé’s tweets with a series of West-inspired memes. One read, “When ur sister in law calls out ur ex for being a stripper but ur wife has a sex tape,” referencing Kim’s sex tape with singer Ray J. West shot back a few days later, making his own appearance on The Breakfast Club. “She’s just soakin’ in the moment. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there wouldn’t be an Amber Rose,” West said of his ex. “It’s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that’s with Amber Rose. … I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.”  💋 A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Apr 21, 2015 at 4:34pm PDT  Blac Chyna Mocks Kylie Jenner Online  As Jenner’s romance with Tyga continued, his ex posted several telling photos via Instagram in April 2015, making light of the new relationship. While the #KylieJennerChallege started trending, Chyna shared a photo of herself wearing giant fake lips. Then she posted screengrabs, which she alleged were from Tyga. One such text read: “I want to be with u.”  Kylie Jenner Goes Public With Tyga on 18th Birthday  In August 2015, Jenner finally turned 18 and, now legal, went public with Tyga. The social media starlet had a blowout birthday bash, and her new official beau gifted her with two cars, including a $260,000 Ferrari.  Tyga Feuds With Blac Chyna Over Kylie Jenner’s Ferrari  The pricey purchase sparked a fresh feud between Tyga, Chyna and Rose. TMZ reported that Tyga had leased the swanky gift, which Tyga claimed was a lie. “When the hating don’t work they start telling lies. #WhereYoFerarriTho?” he captioned an Instagram selfie. Naturally, Rose chimed in, defending her friend with a photo of her own pink Ferrari. “She don’t need a Ferrari she can Drive mine,” she captioned the shot.  Kylie Jenner and Tyga Split, Get Back Together  On Tyga’s 26th birthday in November 2015, the couple split and Jenner deleted almost all mentions of her flame from her Instagram account. But days later they made up, and Jenner described the rekindling romance as “Chaos” in a new post.  #nofilter A post shared by Annalu (@annalucardosod) on Dec 11, 2015 at 3:39pm PST  Tyga Has a Fling With a Brazilian Model  Us exclusively broke the story in January 2016 that Tyga had been cheating on Jenner with Brazilian model Annalu Cardoso for months. The pair started texting in late 2014 and had “hooked up a couple of times,” an insider told Us. Around the same time, 14-year-old model Molly O’Malia also accused the “Stimulated” rapper of sending her “uncomfortable” messages.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BA9v0LFxvip/  Blac Chyna Posts Photo With Rob Kardashian  Rumors abounded on January 25, 2016, when Chyna posted a black-and-white Instagram of herself in the loving embrace of Rob Kardashian with the caption “The beginning.”  Khloé Kardashian Seemingly Reacts to Rob’s News  Shortly after the photo was posted, Khloé tweeted a telling quote from The Godfather: “You can do anything. But never go against the family.” After followers noted her quote was likely about Rob and Chyna, the reality star replied, “You guys do know I have about 100 family members correct? I was referring to a family member who just bailed out of doing my talk show today. But hey, maybe my quote can go towards a few people today.”  Rob Kardashian Confirms the Relationship  A day after Chyna’s Instagram post, Rob reposted a meme of his new love holding a car seat. “Blac Chyna probably out shopping rite now as she plan to give birth to the only next generation of the Kardashian Name! #BabyKardashian.” He captioned the meme with the clover emoji, which became a secret symbol between the pair. Twitter users pointed out that Rob’s birthday is on March 17, a.k.a. St. Patrick’s Day.  “The family is in a bind trying to be supportive of Rob’s life while being sensitive of Kylie’s relationship with Tyga,” a source explained to Us at the start of the romance.  Kanye West Goes Off on Wiz Khalifa on Twitter  The same week — but on an unrelated note — West took aim at former pal Khalifa and ex Rose in a headline-making Twitter rant. It started when Khalifa dissed the title of West’s upcoming album, Waves. “Please don’t take the wave,” he tweeted. “Max B is the wavy one. He created the wave. There is no wave without him.”  He then went on to write, “Hit this kk and become yourself.” Misunderstanding Khalifa’s reference to Khalifa Kush weed, West then started ranting against the rapper on Twitter. “Like, oh that’s Ye and I can put his wife’s initials on my twitter @WizKhalifa,” West wrote. “You have distracted from my creative process. I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants.”  As the tweets raged on, West slammed his ex Rose, writing, “4th you let a stripper trap you. 5th I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years.”  Amber Rose Weighs In on Kanye/Wiz Twitter Beef  Not willing to let her ex’s insults slide, Rose responded with the tweet, “Awww @kanyewest are u mad I’m not around to play in ur a–hole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.” West later deleted his tweets, apologizing for the misunderstanding about Kim’s initials, to which Rose replied, “Lol @kanyewest Now u wanna delete ur tweets cuz Muva has arrived? #TwitterFingers #UrGettingBodiedByAStripperN—a.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

       " 'Tia Mowry‘s hard work has paid off!  After being diagnosed with endometriosis, the Sister Sister actress overhauled her diet and has been sticking to the principles outlined in her cookbook Whole New You. She shuns “processed, packaged” foods and instead opts for “whole foods” like fruits, vegetables, seeds and whole grains, she told PEOPLE.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  And the Tia Mowry At Home star, 38, is thrilled with the results, which she recently shared on Instagram. The mom posted an image of herself wearing leggings and lifting up her t-shirt to reveal her abs, “I’ve lost 20 pounds! Many asked how? Diet and cooking out of my cook book #wholenewyou,” she captioned the photo.  Although she mostly sticks to clean eating, Mowry will still indulge in the occasional treat. Prior to posting her weight loss photo, the star took to Instagram to share a picture of herself licking an ice cream cone. “Ice cream didn’t stand a chance,” she wrote.  Mowry didn’t always have such a healthy relationship with food. In her cookbook, she reveals she developed poor eating habits on the set of Sister Sister, where she would snack on candy, cookies and potato chips.

       " 'Flip or Flop is a television series airing on HGTV hosted by real estate agents and real-life husband and wife Tarek and Christina El Moussa,[1] and beginning with season 7, episode 6, the two continue working together although divorced. The show is the original show in the Flip or Flop franchise.  Premise [ edit ]  The El Moussas were both real estate agents prior to the crash in 2008, and later they began flipping homes, mostly in Orange County, California.  In 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape was sent to HGTV, and they were interested in talking to the couple. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that shows the process of buying distressed property and renovating it.[2]  Christina\\'s expertise is primarily in design, and she works with Tarek to find and renovate homes. She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[3]  Hosts [ edit ]  Personal life [ edit ]  Tarek El Moussa grew up in Buena Park, California and Christina Meursinge Haack grew up in Anaheim Hills. Tarek, who earned his real estate license at age 21, met Christina while working in the real estate industry.[4] The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[5] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[6]  The couple married in 2009 and have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[7]  In 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek\\'s neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. Tarek had previously had the lump examined, and he said there was no issue. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek had the lump checked again; doctors discovered that he had stage 2 thyroid cancer.[8] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[9]  In May 2016, the couple had secretly split due to \"challenges\" in their marriage.[10] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[11]  Real estate career [ edit ]  Tarek and Christina run a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[12]  Series overview [ edit ]  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 8 June 15, 2017 ( ) July 20, 2017 ( 2017-07-20 ) 8 TBA May 31, 2018 ( ) TBA  References [ edit ]',\n",

We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Tom Cruise is feeling so betrayed by Jamie Foxx dating his ex-wife Katie Holmes, according to a source.  We’ve got a bro-code violation going on! Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie Foxx, 49, were once pals, as the megastar recruited the actor to star with him in 2004’s action film Collateral. They remained friendly up until the Annie star began dating Katie Holmes, 38, just a year after she divorced Tom in 2012 in such a dramatic way. Four years later, Holmes and Foxx have finally taken their romance out into the open, but the Mission: Impossible star has aware that they were a couple for some time and isn’t thrilled that his friend would date his former wife.  HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Tom has known about Katie and Jamie’s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up. While Katie and Jamie did their best to keep things a secret from the world, Tom is too well-connected and found out about them shortly after their romance began,” a source close to Tom tellsEXCLUSIVELY. See pics of Tom and Katie’s marriage in photos, here  “Tom is shocked and upset that Katie is dating a costar he once considered a close friend. He feels betrayed by both of them,” our insider adds. Katie broke away from Tom and the Church of Scientology in such a public way, serving him with divorce papers in June of 2012 when he was away on location in Iceland filming a movie. While she and daughter Suri, now 11, remained holed up in New York for months, Katie started going to more social events in 2013, and it was in August of that year that she met Jamie at a Hamptons gala.  The two were rumored to be secretly dating on the down-low for four years now , apparently out of respect for Tom by not making their relationship public and going to great lengths to never be photographed together. But now that over five years have passed since she filed for divorce, the couple apparently were less careful about keeping the romance out of the public eye. They were spotted over Labor Day weekend holding hands together while walking down the beach in Malibu and didn’t appear to care that the paparazzi captured the PDA.  HollywoodLifers, do you think now that they’re out in the open as a couple, Katie and Jamie will start attending events together?',\n",

       " 'Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former “Dawson’s Creek” actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn’t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio’s birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her “Django Unchained” boyfriend they needed to break up.  “Jamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,” a source told RadarOnline. “Katie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie’s behavior. She knew it wasn’t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.”  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri’s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn’t see her.  “Tom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn’t see Suri, he didn’t question it,” an insider told the Star. “But Tom’s tired of being bossed around by them. He’s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he’s missed out on so much. He’s dying to be a part of her life!”  Holmes isn’t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to “brainwash” her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what’s best for Suri.  “She’s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,” an insider told the Star. “Suri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what’s best for her. Tom has assured her he won’t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.”  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes’ publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  “The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,” Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes’ publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis’s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx’s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes’ romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes’ life is that she’s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter’s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  “My little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,” Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.',\n",

George Pimentel/Getty Images  “During the process, Meghan expressed the desire to wear something simple and classy and very elegant,\" Scobie said. \"I think we\\'ll see her go down that route for the wedding day as well.”  Mulroney’s four-day visit to Kensington Palace last week also allowed Markle and Mulroney to start reviewing plans for the May 19, 2018, wedding and reception. Mulroney, also a bridal planner, is assisting Markle in the entire design and concept of the wedding party outfits and look for the reception.  “Jessica Mulroney has a rich history when it comes to ... wedding planning and bridal styling,\" Scobie said. \"It\\'s not just the dress she\\'s involved in. She\\'s actually helping with a number of elements for the big day and I think Meghan is really relying heavily on her expertise and a lot of the decision she has to make, and there are many.\"  Harry, the fifth in line to the throne, has \"made himself scarce\" when it comes to the wedding planning, Scobie said.  Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  “Harry made himself scarce, giving the girls plenty of private time to kind of have their meetings with the designers and, of course, choose other wedding elements,\" he said. \"Harry\\'s kind of made it clear that he wants to make this about Meghan.\"  The bride and groom have yet to send out formal wedding invitations but they have been telling close friends to save the date.  Geoff Pugh/REX/Shutterstock  Among the high-profile guests who could attend Harry and Markle\\'s wedding at Windsor Castle are Barack and Michelle Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and some of Markle\\'s celebrity friends, including actress Priyanka Chopra, designer Misha Nonoo and tennis star Serena Williams.  Prince William and Princess Kate invited Ellie Goulding to perform at their wedding reception in 2011.  \"Harry has actually put on the top of his list his good friend Ed Sheeran to perform at the after-party,\" US Weekly magazine editor-in-chief Jennifer Peros told \"Good Morning America.\"  As for the bridal party, Prince William and Kate\\'s children -- Prince George and Princess Charlotte -- will take center stage as page boy and flower girl, respectively, as they did at the 2017 wedding of their aunt, Pippa Middleton.  \"Another surprise will be Jessica Mulroney\\'s daughter, Ivy, who I heard will be a flower girl on the day,\" Scobie said.  Who is Jessica Mulroney?  George Pimentel/Getty Images  Mulroney is Canada’s best-known stylist. She represents not only Markle but also assists Canada\\'s first lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and many members of Canada’s elite.  Markle lived in Toronto during her seven-season run on the TV drama \"Suits,\" which films in the Canadian city.  Markle\\'s much-emulated style and the so-called \"Meghan effect,\" where anything she wears quickly crashes websites and sells out, is largely because of the collaboration and vision between Mulroney and Markle.  Mulroney has been seen at Markle\\'s side at yoga outings together and at her most important public appearances.

Alexi Lubomirski via AP  Alexi Lubomirski via AP  Markle\\'s selection of outfits that are a nod to her Canadian ties and U.S. and now British roots has also come with the help of Mulroney. The nod to selecting styles from designers with local roots, often called diplomatic dressing, is also done by Princess Kate on official royal diplomatic tours.  \"One thing to really take into account is that Megan has always been very conscious of where she\\'s going when she dresses,\" Scobie said. \"Of course we\\'ve seen her make nods to the locations she\\'s at or the country she\\'s in with the style choices she\\'s made.\"  Looking ahead to Markle\\'s wedding day, Scobie added, \"I think on the day of the wedding we\\'ll very much see her kind of make a nod to the different places that she feels are important to her.\"  Mulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada. The couple is one of Canada\\'s best-known power couples and are often considered Canadian royalty in Toronto.

       " 'Kim Kardashian is trapped in a terrorism nightmare after RadarOnline.com learned cops have linked her stolen gems to the coffers of Islamic jihadists!  In a bombshell world exclusive, a top Interpol source claimed they have connected the diamonds snatched from Kardashian’s Paris hotel suite during a brazen Oct. 3 robbery to shady moneymen with ties to radical Islamic terrorists.  French police have busted 17 suspects allegedly involved in the heist, and authorities have connected that gang to black-market dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.  Most of the world’s diamonds pass through the city, where underground brokers are notorious for mixing “dirty” stolen stones with “clean” gems for resale.  PHOTOS: Kim’s Hellhole EXPOSED! Inside The Paris Apartment Where Kardashian Was Attacked  Antwerp’s illicit marketplace is a hotbed for devious money-laundering schemes — with profits going to fund violent terrorists around the globe, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an elite band of bean counters that tracks terrorist funds.  “There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups,” said a European official involved in tracking terror groups’ funding.  What’s more, David Levine, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who’s published works on terrorism, confirmed, “Violent groups are funded by black-market gems.”  PHOTOS: Kim On Lockdown! Kardashian’s Inner Circle Swarms NYC Pad  Kardashian’s nightmare unfolded last fall, when robbers forced their way into the private Paris residence where she was staying.

       " 'The stature of “Twin Peaks,” David Lynch’s two-season surreal murder mystery that ran on ABC in the early ‘90s, is such that its modern-day reboot almost defies interpretation. Showtime’s “Twin Peaks: The Return” picks up the story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) 25 years later, and attempts to be an homage, a sequel, and a standalone story. The unique nature of this revival is overshadowed by the fact that the show itself was always a surprising, weird gem in the otherwise predictable stable of broadcast television programming. It’s hard to know whether it is more surprising that “Twin Peaks” ever existed or caught in the first place, or that 27 years after its cancellation, it has returned on premium cable with so much of the original cast and crew preserved. Lynch brought auteur-ish filmmaking to television, which elevated the medium for many viewers. Now its most prestigious, high-minded arm has brought him back. And it has the marketing blitz to prove it.  This is a long way of saying that it is difficult to know where to begin with Showtime’s “Twin Peaks,” which premiered its first two parts Sunday night. Fans of Lynch — and fans of the series, who have mythologized its idiosyncratic details over the last two decades — will take in the director’s vision with open arms, savoring its bizarre iconography and nonlinear storytelling. They will undoubtedly find a lot to be happy with in this two-hour premiere, which is parts 1 and 2 of “Twin Peaks: The Return” (though there is no clear delineation between parts). Lynch, who directed the episode and co-wrote it with Mark Frost, begins with the Black Lodge, which he explored extensively in the second-season finale and in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” the prequel film. The new “Twin Peaks” uses grounding footage from the old “Twin Peaks” to establish some of the basics of the mythology: Cooper is stuck in the Lodge while his doppelgänger — inhabited by Bob (Frank Silva), an evil spirit — is in the world. Lynch, throughout “Twin Peaks,” is at his absolute best in Black Lodge scenes, and there is a bit of relief in seeing that even in this Showtime interpretation, the Black Lodge is still eerie and destabilizing.  Related Emmys: Limited Series Makeup Artisans Honor History on the Small Screen Emmys: The Shows With the Most Nominations in Creative Arts Categories  At the same time, the Black Lodge is also where one of the first obvious differences between the old and new “Twin Peaks” emerges: the simple fact of production values. Much of the odd, creepy charm of the original “Twin Peaks” was that Lynch was shoehorning his bizarre vision into a murder arc of a soap opera — with its interminable pacing, melodramatic music, and small-town archetypal characters. Part of that mood was a low-budget sensibility, which translated to artfully deliberate poor quality. It’s one of the reasons “Twin Peaks” is so aesthetically unique. But Showtime gave David Lynch nearly carte blanche for this new production, and as a result, it really doesn’t have that low-budget patina. The production values make for immersive, textured shots of the woods around the town of Twin Peaks — sometimes, the trees seem like more fleshed-out characters than the minor characters they are partially obscuring, and Lynch sometimes films unfolding scenes as if the viewer is just another character in a video game. But for every moment that feels fascinating in a new way, there is self-indulgence. The bankable popularity of “Twin Peaks” also makes for an inexplicably stupid scene at the Bang Bang where the indie-electronic band Chromatics performs to a room of middle-aged townies taking tequila shots. Nothing says rural, small-town, faded glory like an impossibly cool synthpop band. Could it be possible that sometimes, network notes are a good thing?  The finest scenes of the new “Twin Peaks” occur nowhere near Twin Peaks at all. In New York City — introduced in a swooping series of shots that feel like how an animated comic-book show would take us to the villain’s “HQ” — a man is watching, and filming, a glass box. It has a circular aperture that looks out onto the city from its high perch at the top of a skyscraper. And opposite the glass box is a couch, with two tasteful lamps and an end table. Sam’s job is to see if anything appears inside the box. If you watched “Twin Peaks” while sitting on a couch, you may have noticed that just as you watched a glass box waiting for something to happen, the box — and the man on it — watched you in return. That the box then erupts with something unnameably evil — just at the moment, of course, when Sam (Ben Rosenfield) is distracted by the charms of Tracey (Madeline Zima). Their violent, brutal death is not quite the type of gore that “Twin Peaks” is known for, but that’s what made it so interesting. The show’s aesthetic is typically fuzzy. But the glossy box gleams in its careful lighting, and in the middle the aperture is a perfect circle, an eye unto the world. The unnameable evil, when it emerges, is like a creature constructed of white noise, a blurry bit of static. It is terrifying.  A little less terrifying is what has become of Cooper’s doppelgänger — let’s just call him Evil Cooper. He is in Buckhorn, South Dakota, and he looks like a washed-up rocker from the ‘80s who never realized the party ended. MacLachlan is doused in spray tan and wearing snakeskin; Lynch’s manifestation of evil appears to be a guy wearing leather with a half-ponytail. The effect is kind of ludicrously seedy, and MacLachlan is a little uncomfortable there; he’s better in the moments where he is called on to emote silently while trapped in the Black Lodge. At the same time, Evil Cooper isn’t just a joke: In the back half of the episode, he kills Darya (Nicole LaLiberte) with close-range, heartless violence. Evil Cooper is creating mayhem for Bill Hastings (Matthew Lillard), who is beginning to have an arc that looks like Leland Palmer’s (Ray Wise) — he dreamed committing an awful murder that turns out to have been real. Evil Cooper follows his wife home, and then kills her with her lover’s gun, saying: “You did good. You followed human nature perfectly.”  Human nature sometimes seems like it is the furthest thing from Lynch’s mind. “Twin Peaks: The Return” contains several long shots that reduce its characters to just tiny figures in a vast landscape. And yet even amidst the new surrealities of the Black Lodge (the Arm is now a tree with a brain!?) its most meaningless stretches continue to delight him. “Twin Peaks” attention to the most bathetic moments of human existence is strangely comforting, even as a comedy of manners in an apartment complex’s anonymous hallway gives way, with one twisted doorknob, into a ritualistic horror show. Lynch and Frost have doubled their cast in “Twin Peaks: The Return,” out of apparent curiosity for how all of these people live. It’s at times a confounding amount of detail; late in the two-hour episode, when Jennifer Jason Leigh turns out to have been next door the whole time, the scale of what this reboot is trying to accomplish is both daunting and a little maddening.  “Twin Peaks: The Return” is weird and creepy and slow. But it is interesting. The show is very stubbornly itself — not quite film and not quite TV, rejecting both standard storytelling and standard forms. It’s not especially fun to watch and it can be quite disturbing. But there is never a sense that you are watching something devoid of vision or intention. Lynch’s vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn’t be otherwise acceptable .',\n",

       " \"The video made it clear that Spears isn't herself when she's hungry.  Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari posted a video on Wednesday night which gave fans a hilarious glimpse at what the singer is really like when she’s hungry. In the Instagram clip, Spears and Asghari start off walking hand in hand down a hallway. As they walk, you can hear Asghari complimenting Spears on her outfit. But then she interrupts him and asks where they’ll be eating. When he says “steakhouse,” she gets a goofy expression on her face and runs off, to which Asghari replies, “I think she’s really hungry.”  Spears confirmed that in the caption of her video.  “I was freaking hungry.” she wrote.  Britney Spears and Sam Asghari have often given fans behind the scenes peeks into their relationship via posts on Instagram. They’ve become known for their couples workout videos which show off their physical fitness and affection for each other. Britney also regularly shares heartwarming photos of them looking very much in love.  In the past, Asghari has said that he believes that they were brought together by fate. He was cast in her “Slumber Party” video in 2016 and he told Men’s Health that his inclusion in the taping was a last minute decision as they had already hired most of the other people who were in it.  “I got a call at midnight,” Asghari told Men’s Health in July.  “It went through so much to get to me. I don’t know if it’s some sort of a blessing or just meant to be.”  The Iranian-born model added that he tried to be funny with her after she introduced herself by pretending that he didn’t hear her name. It looks like the joke worked though because shortly after the video was released, the two were photographed together by paparazzi. Based on what Asghari said to Men’s Health, it looks like they started dating very soon after they met because, at one point, he reveals they never had any intention of being friends.  During the interview, Asghari raved about his popstar girlfriend, praising her for her humble nature and expressing gratitude for her presence in his life.  “She motivates me more than anyone,” Asghari continued.\",\n",

       " 'Millie Bobby Brown is best known for her breakout role as telekinetic child Eleven in Netflix\\'s \\'Stranger Things.\\'  Who Is Millie Bobby Brown?  Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.  Early Life & Career  Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents \"she has instincts you cannot teach.\"  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Brown\\'s parents sacrificed everything — moving their family to Los Angeles — to see Brown\\'s acting dreams come true. Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC\\'s Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and soon after she appeared as Madison O\\'Donnell in BBC America\\'s Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey’s Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. \"I was devastated. I wasn’t getting work. I thought I was done,\" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.  \\'Stranger Things\\'  However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix\\'s Stranger Things. \"I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,\" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.  Set in a 1980s Indiana town facing a threat from paranormal activity, Stranger Things became a hit upon its release in 2016, earning an array of awards. Meanwhile, Brown was heralded as one of its breakout performers for her role of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers.  The show\\'s success was such that its primary actors all scored big raises heading into Season 3, with Brown rumored to be earning as much as its best-known star, Winona Ryder.  In April 2018, the 14-year-old Brown was the youngest person named to Time\\'s 100 most influential list. Writing about her inclusion among the special group, actor Aaron Paul recalled how he was stunned by Brown\\'s wisdom and perspective upon meeting her, feeling like he was talking to a future leader. \"Maybe that\\'s why she\\'s such an extraordinary actor,\" he wrote. \"She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.\"  Actress Millie Bobby Brown attends the premiere of Netflix\\'s \\'Stranger Things\\' at Mack Sennett Studios on July 11, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.

The young couple confirmed their relationship with sweet messages addressed to one another via Instagram on Valentine\\'s Day 2018 but broke up a few months later in July 2018.  Meanwhile, the unfortunate meme #takedownmilliebobbybrown was gaining steam on social media. Beginning with a user who accused Brown of pulling off her hijab and stamping on it, the thread took on a life of its own as people relayed their \"story\" of the actress attacking them while delivering expletive-filled homophobic comments.

The three-hour show, hosted by Roselyn Sanchez and Jaime Camil, included sizzling performances by Luis Fonsi, Steve Aoki, Alessia Cara, J Balvin, Maluma and Person of the Year Alejandro Sanz, among others.

EXCLUSIVE: Luis Fonsi on His Influential 20-Year Career and His Mission to Help Rebuild Puerto Rico  “The Latin GRAMMYs to me are the most important music award for Latin music and to have four nominations is certainly an honor,” said Fonsi, who won his first Latin GRAMMY in 2009 for “Aqui Estoy Yo,” which was awarded Song of the Year.  \"To have Record of the Year and Song of the Year nominations are two huge categories, those two have a lot of weight,” he added. “But, you can’t control whether you win or lose and all the artists that are nominated are amazing, so I’m really just truly blessed to be among a great group of artists that I admire.\"  Lin-Manuel Miranda was also honored with the President\\'s Merit Award for his outstanding and numerous contributions to the Latin community, including his relief efforts for Puerto Rico following the devastation of Hurricane Maria.

       " 'One wouldn’t want to be in Prince William’s (dancing) shoes right now. Dubbed “throne idle” in the British press after skipping a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week in order to go skiing with friends, the 34-year-old royal is also understood to be in the dog house with his wife.  Kate is said by Royal Watch sources to be understandably “less than pleased” that her husband has been filmed partying with his friends and an unidentified woman. The new footage, which emerged Wednesday in several tabloids, shows Prince William singing and dancing with friends during a boys-only skiing trip. Shot at the popular Farinet nightclub in Verbier, the video also shows the prince putting his hand on the waist of a mystery woman  William was also filmed “dad dancing” at the club and enjoying himself on the slopes just hours before senior royals including the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service. The Queen considers the date one of the most important in the royal calendar and William’s decision not to attend was seen as significant and controversial. While the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at home with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, William, who is now back in the U.K, chose to have fun on the slopes instead of attending the service.  VIDEO: 12 Facts About Kate Middleton  “It was William’s choice to go away, but make no mistake Kate wears the trousers in their marriage, and she won’t be happy with William’s antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she’ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,” says a source.  The couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.  Last February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.  According to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked “very worse for wear” after downing “several drinks.” William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he’s out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee’s wedding four years ago—which Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George—William reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.  According to sources on the slopes, the champagne—and spirits—were flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.  Kate, who’s not a big drinker, is apparently not the only wife said to be annoyed. Guy Pelly, whose other half, Lizzie Wilson, is about to give birth, is according to a source also “in deep trouble.”  Get Vanity Fair’s Royal Watch A weekly overview of the chatter from Kensington Palace and beyond.

       " 'To see more from the First Look issue, pick up the latest Entertainment Weekly on stands Friday, or buy it here now. Don’t forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.  The series famous for giving makeovers is getting one of its own. Come February on Netflix, Karamo Brown (culture), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming), Tan France (fashion), Antoni Porowski (food and wine), and Bobby Berk (design) will assume the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Fab 5 mantle once occupied by Jai Rodriguez, Kyan Douglas, Carson Kressley, Ted Allen, and Thom Filicia.  When the show — which follows the stars as they give holistic makeovers to straight men — premiered in 2003 on Bravo, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon, even winning the Outstanding Reality Program Emmy the following year. A lot has changed in the years since, though. “It’s a new time with a new audience,” series creator David Collins tells EW. “If the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance.”  Which means audiences — but especially each episode’s subject, or “hero” as they’re called — will learn more about the Fab 5’s personal lives as they ditch the concrete jungle of New York City to take on straight guys in red states. “In order to make the emotions bigger, you actually had to see how [the Fab 5] were reacting to being with a cop from the South who was a Trump supporter, [or] ‘hillbilly Tom,’ who refers to himself by saying ‘you can’t fix ugly,’” executive producer Rob Eric explains. “These guys walked away truly loving every single hero that they made over and talked about them for weeks afterward. It affected them just as much as they affected our hero.”  Finding the new Fab 5 was “a blast,” Collins says, but still no easy task. Producers narrowed the field from hundreds to 40 guys after an international search, with some “silly, amazing” auditions earlier this year in L.A. The result is an eclectic mix of personalities. Brown, who appeared on The Real World: Philadelphia, stood out for his charisma and style. Viewers may know Van Ness from his hit web series Gay of Thrones, or Berk from his line of home furnishings. Producers have former Fab 5-er Ted Allen to thank for finding Porowski; he was the Chopped host’s protégé and personal chef. And France, originally from England, is the creator of women’s clothing line Kingdom & State and co-creator of Rachel Parcell Inc, serving as lead designer for both brands until this year.  “Each one of them is so unique,” Collins says proudly. Not to mention, fabulous.  Above, check out the exclusive first look at the new Fab 5, and below, Collins explains why now was the right time to revive the show, how the move to Netflix has given them more freedom, what he loves about each of the new guys, and whether we might see any of the original Fab 5 on the revival.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: In the couple episodes I got to watch, the thing that really stood is out is how much more of a “connection” there seems to be between the new Fab 5 and the straight guy than I remember from the original series. These stories are so entirely different but so engrossing… and emotional!  DAVID COLLINS: It’s great to hear that. Storytelling, obviously, is ultimately the topline goal. There is a format to the show — it’s all in pieces there – but for sure the episodic hero is our main focus, his story and his interactions with the Fab 5. It’s all about story, always.  When I watched the episode featuring Cory, the police officer from Winder, Georgia, I wondered where it would go with him considering he wasn’t in huge need of a physical makeover, but that episode really proves it’s not always about the clothes and mustache and hair.  It’s interesting that you bring up the makeover part because a lot of times for us, this time is — makeovers are very important and the reveal and all that, but really the bottom line is that inside change, that moment where they’ve had a revelation, they’ve had an understanding; “confidence breeds success” has always been our through line there, and that’s one of those things that I have to say we’re really proud of that’s come through in these individual stories.  There’s a really powerful moment between Karamo and Cory as they discuss relations between police and black communities. Karamo admitted he was not excited to spend time with Cory because of something that happens at the beginning of the episode. Did you have any idea that’s how he was going to react?  [Laughs] We had no idea how Karamo was going to react, and it really ended up, obviously, driving the entire episode and telling the story. The experience of our Fab 5 with each guy is real-time — five full days with our guy — so that conversation really got to grow organically and authentically over their time together, and that’s been something in the Netflix Queer Eye that we’ve been able to do, which is allow those relationships to really develop and grow over their time together.  On that topic, what kind of new freedoms do you have being on Netflix versus cable?  A lot. There was the one “gay day” in the original Queer Eye and in this one we realized that the Fab 5 and the time spent with our episodic hero was critical. To allow a real, authentic relationship to grow, you gotta hang out, you gotta have some coffee, you gotta eat some bread. Those are the moments we realized really gave breadth to the story… you see how the conversation grows and especially how the questions change; the episodic hero says, “Huh, well I never thought of it this way, but what about this?” and our Fab 5, because we get to hear their stories now and see them and hear their journey as part of the individual episode, it’s been a really great marriage of those two worlds.  Why was now the right time to revive the show?  It’s one of those things that for me is really simple: It’s a really great show, and it’s a new time with a new audience. The millennials don’t remember the old show. It’s got such a great heart and soul and humor to it, so I’m excited for a new audience. But I guess if there was something to be real specific, if the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance. We ultimately realized that there was a great opportunity for the Fab 5 to grow and be much more open about their personal lives. If you think about the original five, we definitely weren’t going to be talking about that Tan is married to a Mormon cowboy, let alone that he’s Muslim. [Laughs] So it’s those authentic moments that really pay off in this new version of Queer Eye.  Why now? There’s really an ultimate moment: Why not? These are five guys who come in, they help someone in not just the outward but the inward, and ultimately, we’ve always said confidence breed success, and when they bring that confidence into someone’s world, like Tom — when you see Tom realize that he starts to feel good about himself, you see it, you feel it. And the same with Cory; Cory had such a great experience. It’s been funny, because we had to keep everything under wraps, he is so dying to reconnect with the guys. He keeps texting and sending me Instagram messages because he really wants to stay in touch with them. It’s been that; it’s kinda cool.  Which one of the Fab 5 did you cast first?  The casting was a blast. [Laughs] We had a really large nationwide — actually it was global because we had Australia and the U.K. all part of our casting — we had literally hundreds and hundreds of guys that we went through, and we ultimately picked our top 40 and flew them all out to Los Angeles and had a three-and-a-half day extravaganza like you’ve never seen. [Laughs] We brought everyone to the same hotel and we rented out this big banquet hall room and had some silly, amazing casting going on. The team really — it’s probably one of those full circle moments for me — when the first Fab 5 were coming together, the same thing happened; it just starts to happen, the chemistry starts to click, you see that this guy and that guy are an amazing duo, and then you add the third, fourth, and fifth and you realize, wow, this is a team. Each one of them is so unique.  What is it you love about each of them?  Jonathan, obviously, it would be hard to miss how authentic he is. He’s so proud of being himself and he’s so confident in himself because he really battled that. He was the middle-of-nowhere kid who really grew up getting bullied hard. He fought, he really fought, for being who he is; he has no body shame, he has no shame of his sexuality, he is beautifully himself and authentic. [Laughs] And he’s kinda funny too… just cracking you up at every turn.  Karamo is just the epitome of style and taste and class. He’s so charismatic, he pulls you right in, smart as a whip. What’s beautiful about him is, he’s an amazing listener; he stops and really hears what everyone, what the guys are saying to him and then he’s able to really process that and bring it back. It’s really a beautiful gift of his.  Tan… style and class… he is the full picture there. His sense of posh is just beautiful. He’s also got that edge to him. He’s a little like Adele, I used to say [laughs] — Adele has that gorgeous voice and she sings so beautifully, and then when she talks she’s got that Cockney accent and will tell you how to shove it up your whatever. Tan’s got the same thing; he’s smart and witty, but always classy.  Bobby, aside from being crazily talented — he’s so, so good with what he does with his style and his design work — Bobby is a guy who worked really hard to get where he is. He’ll tell you, he’s a kid who grew up with nothing and really fought hard to really do well for himself. He’s a hard worker, he’s a really hard worker, and he brought that to the table. He really cared about each of our episodes and each of the guys and bringing something special along the way.  And then, Mr. Antoni. He’s just so filled with passion and he’s scarily smart. He was actually Ted [Allen]’s protégé. Ted sent him our way and we couldn’t be happier. He’s got that adorable face and you just want to squeeze his little head off. He’s so, so smart, he’s very well read, and his sense of passion and taste is beautiful as well.  Speaking of Ted, is there any chance we’ll see the original Fab 5 show up in any episodes with the new guys, or does moving the show from New York into more rural areas make that difficult?  Well, I’m not going to say no or never because you never know, but the new team is there and… I can’t say no because who knows, maybe we will do something where they all come together. But I think right now it’s the new show, it’s the new Fab 5 and they are definitely out there in the red states and seeing the world. It’s kind of their moment and their time, but definitely the original guys, the OG, are thrilled for us. That’s probably been one of the most beautiful things is that everyone has been so supportive on this journey and really, really loved each other. The Fab 10, as they are, have all really bonded beautifully.  Queer Eye will debut on Netflix in February.',\n",

       " 'Dior was so close to doing a great thing, but then fumbled at the last minute. For the label\\'s Cruise 2019 collection, designer Maria Grazia Chiuri based her collection on the beautiful clothing worn by Mexican Escaramuza Charra riders. However, Chirui\\'s inspiration fell flat when her clothing appeared on Dior\\'s face, Jennifer Lawrence. Now, both Dior and Lawrence are being accused of cultural appropriation.  Escaramuza is a traditional Mexican sport that is comprised of 10 to 16 women on horseback doing choreographed dancing and stunts to Mexican music. The sport first began at the birth of the Mexican revolution, during which women were allowed to participate and appear at the front of the battle in their traditional dress.  The wardrobe of the Escaramuza is as beautiful and precise as their routines, and an Escaramuza team must adhere to strict guidelines when crafting their uniform. Frills, shawls, ornaments, boots, and hats are all musts, and give fashion labels like Dior a lot to drool over.  However, by putting Jennifer Lawrence — who is neither Mexican nor Latina — in clothing inspired by such culturally important dress for Mexican women has many questioning whether or not Dior cares about the cultural significance of the Escaramuza at all.  Lawrence said in a behind-the-scenes clip from the photoshoot featured on Dior\\'s Instagram, \"One of the main inspirations of this collection is the traditional women riders of Mexico. I\\'m really excited that this collection is looking at and celebrating these women\\'s heritage through such a modern lens.\"  Many fault Dior for lacking the wherewithal to cast a Mexican model as the face of the collection. Although Lawrence should have seen through the culturally appropriative problem, it\\'s more disappointing that Dior is just that oblivious.  how many marketing meetings did the @Dior team go through before deciding Jennifer Lawrence was the best face for a “modern Mexican” inspired line — hibernal worm (@indigogurt) November 14, 2018  Well this is super fucked up! This collection was inspired by \\'women riders in Mexico\\' but is faced by Jennifer Lawrence and the shoot took place in California.....for real @Dior ????? https://t.co/7U5WMHHEk2 — Margot Woll (@margotwoll) November 13, 2018  \"The audacity to call this shit modern because it’s worn by a white woman is ignorant\"https://t.co/iyixYUSxLJ — HotNewHipHop (@HotNewHipHop) November 14, 2018  Dior did feature a team of Escaramuza, wearing uniforms from Chirui\\'s collection, in the the label\\'s Cruise 2019 fashion show. However, the models presenting the inspired clothing on the runway were primarily white. It\\'s a bit boggling how Dior completely missed the mark.  This cultural appropriation slip up is an obvious reminder that the fashion industry still has a long road ahead of them in terms of diversification and inclusion. Labels must become more aware of the impact they have on culture and society, and do more to make formative statements with their collections.',\n",
       " 'Four Boston-area Teamsters have been found not guilty of extortion charges involving the Bravo series Top Chef – despite testimony from star Padma Lakshmi and crew members that they were threatened and harassed by the striking union members.  A federal jury in Boston, Massachusetts reached the conclusion on Tuesday after 20 hours of deliberation, ending the trial which kicked off earlier this month, the Associated Press reports.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to the Boston Herald, lawyers for the defendants – Robert Cafarelli, John Fidler, Daniel Remond and Michael Ross – had argued that the Teamsters protests outside of a Milton, Massachusetts, restaurant during Top Chef‘s filming there in June 2014 had been legal under a federal law that allows union members to picket if union members are in pursuit of a job.  Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe/Getty Images  Top Chef stars Padma Lakshmi, Gail Simmons and producers of the show testified that they were subject to threats and racial slurs from the Teamsters, who wanted driver jobs on the nonunion production.  Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe/Getty Images (3); Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty Images  Lakshmi alleged that one of the men leaned his arm into her vehicle while other union picketers stopped it and said, ” ‘Oh, lookie here. What a shame about that pretty face,’ ” according to the Boston Herald.

       " 'ABC\\'s popular Once Upon a Time is coming back – but not as you know it.  The fantastical fairy tale series is hitting the reset button for season seven, resulting in a significantly different cast, among other things. Here is everything you need to know about the impending reboot.  Once Upon a Time season 7 release date: When is it on?  Once Upon a Time was renewed for a seventh season on May 11, 2017, with ABC ordering 22 episodes.  At Comic-Con 2017, ABC confirmed that the show will return on Friday, October 6 as part of the network\\'s 2017-18 autumn schedule – yes, Friday nights as opposed to Sunday nights in previous seasons.  ABC  Friday is traditionally a tough night for TV ratings, but ABC is confident the show can perform.  \"We\\'ve turned Friday into more of a destination for our fantasy and science fiction fans,\" ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey explained.  On June 20, co-creator, showrunner, and writer Adam Horowitz posted a snap of the writers\\' room whiteboard on Instagram – indicating that work on the seventh season had begun:  And on July 6, Horowitz confirmed the start of filming:  However, could it be the final ever season? Jamie Chung (who plays recurring character Mulan) claimed that she heard one of the show bosses talking about season seven as if it\\'s the last.  But she did add that the drama is probably \"just going to keep on going\". So don\\'t worry just yet.  Once Upon a Time season 7 cast: Who will be back?  Season six had nine series regulars, but only three will be back in a regular capacity in the new season. They are:  • Lana Parrilla (The Evil Queen / Regina Mills)  • Robert Carlyle (Rumplestiltskin / Mr Gold)  • Colin O\\'Donoghue (Captain Hook / Killian Jones)  ABC  That means the following actors are no longer series regulars :  • Jennifer Morrison (Emma Swan)  • Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow White / Mary Margaret Blanchard)  • Josh Dallas (Prince Charming / David Nolan)  • Emilie de Ravin (Belle / Belle Gold)  • Jared S Gilmore (Henry Mills)  • Rebecca Mader (Wicked Witch of the West / Zelena)  That\\'s right: Hook but no Emma Swan for season seven. Jennifer Morrison, who plays Emma, was offered an extension to her contract as well, but she turned it down citing personal reasons.  \"As much as I love the show, I ultimately had to do what was right for me, and I need to be home,\" she said. \"I need to be in New York, in LA [the show is filmed in Vancouver], I need to be around my family and friends and have a chance at a personal life, and to have opportunities to do new things creatively.\"  Fans will definitely see Emma at least one more time, though. She has agreed to appear in one episode early this new season (7.02, to be precise), and filmed her scenes in mid-July.  Rebecca Mader (Zelena) was the second star to confirm her exit, explaining that she was dropped for creative reasons as part of the reboot.  Then, showrunners Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz confirmed that Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Emilie de Ravin and Jared S Gilmore will all also not be back as regulars – announcing this just two days before the season six finale aired.  De Ravin responded to the announcement on social media, saying that she \"would have loved to continue exploring Belle\\'s journey\" but that it has also \"been an honour and privilege to bring Belle to life\".  ABC  After the finale aired, Goodwin described Snow and Charming\\'s happy ending as a \"bittersweet decision\" and said that she would be keen to return as Snow in the future.  The showrunners have said that the departures of these beloved characters will be referenced in the new season.  They later confirmed that Gilmore will make an appearance in the season seven premiere to bridge the time gap between the season six finale and the events of season seven.  De Ravin will feature in episode four, to provide an \"update\" on her character Belle, while Mader too will pop up in \"multiple\" episodes. Wicked always wins...  ABC  Of course, in light of the mass departure, there will be some brand new additions people can look forward to seeing, as the show relocates from Storybrooke to Hyperion Heights.  Here are the stars joining the show for season seven as new series regulars:  • Andrew J West (Adult Henry Mills)  • Alison Fernandez (Lucy)  • Gabrielle Anwar (Lady Tremaine / Victoria Belfrey)  • Dania Ramirez (Cinderella / Jacinda)  • Mekia Cox (Tiana / Sabine)  And notable recurring characters include:  • Adelaide Kane (Drizella / Ivy)  • Rose Reynolds (Alice / Tilly)  Jared S Gilmore may be young Henry, but scenes in the season six finale revealed a time jump as an adult Henry was seen living in a Seattle apartment – numbered 815, obviously. Adult Henry is portrayed by Andrew J West, who fans of The Walking Dead may remember as cannibal Gareth.  The scenes also introduced adult Henry\\'s daughter Lucy, played by Alison Fernandez (Jane the Virgin, Orange Is the New Black).  ABC  Gabrielle Anwar (Burn Notice) and Dania Ramirez (Heroes, Devious Maids) were announced to be joining the cast in early July. Ramirez will be playing Cinderella – a role previously inhabited by Jessy Schram – who is also Lucy\\'s mother, while Anwar has been cast as Lady Tremaine, Cinderella\\'s wicked stepmother.  Lady Tremaine (aka Victoria Belfrey in Hyperion Heights) has been described as being even more ruthless than the Evil Queen, and is the one who is behind the new curse.  \"Why it\\'s important for her to be royal, why it\\'s important for her to crush everyone else, is the story of the year. In true Once Upon a Time fashion, evil isn\\'t born – it\\'s made, and we\\'ll see that with her as well,\" explained showrunner Edward Kitsis.  ABC/Eike Schroter  Related: Here\\'s how Once Upon a Time season 7 might introduce new versions of classic characters  It\\'s unclear how the different Cinderellas will play out exactly, but showrunner Edward Kitsis teased: \"New books could have different versions of some stories and ways of looking at them that maybe we\\'ve seen before, maybe some new characters as well.\"  Also in July, Rose Reynolds (Poldark), Adelaide Kane (Reign), and Mekia Cox (Chicago Med) boarded as recurring characters. In August, Cox was upped to series regular.  Reynolds will be picking up the role of Alice from Alice in Wonderland, while Kane and Cox have been confirmed to be playing Drizella (one of Cinderella\\'s evil stepsisters) and Tiana (from The Princess and the Frog) respectively.  ABC  The cursed counterpart of Ramirez\\'s Cinderella is called Jacinda, while Tiana goes by Sabine. Drizella and Alice go by the names Ivy and Tilly in Hyperion Heights.  Kane gave a little tease about Drizella / Ivy, describing her character as \"buttoned-up and bitchy\".  \"She seems like a very high-strung, slightly ditzy young woman, and she\\'s just very petty and she\\'s like that awful bully in high school, except that she doesn\\'t know how to win people to her side,\" she shared. \"So she\\'s just alone, snappy, snarky, sarcastic, and miserable all the time.\"  On the other hand, Alice is somebody who appears to be working for Rumplestiltskin / Weaver – both in the Enchanted Forest and in Hyperion Heights.  ABC  Elsewhere, Once Upon a Time is bringing back Giles Matthey as Gideon for one episode, Robin Givens has been cast as Tiana\\'s mother Eudora, described as a \"benevolent noblewoman\", and Meegan Warner will play a new and different version of Rapunzel.  One character who is not expected to be returning is Sean Maguire\\'s Robin Hood.  \"Never say never, but not in the immediate run of episodes,\" said showrunner Adam Horowitz.  Once Upon a Time season 7 trailer: \\'A New Curse Awakens\\'  The Once Upon a Time panel at Comic-Con 2017 dropped a quick tease about what to expect from the rebooted series, premiering two scenes from the upcoming season as well as a new trailer.  The trailer quickly recapped the series so far before replaying the end of season six, which saw the adult Henry visited by his daughter as Henry visited Emma Swan in the pilot.  Additionally, the two scenes that aired at the panel featured Jared S Gilmore\\'s young version of Henry as he goes to explore new fairy tales, while a second showed adult Henry is crashing into Cinderella\\'s horse-drawn carriage.  Teasing what\\'s next for the show, showrunner Edward Kitsis said: \"What we\\'re going to do now is go on a new adventure.\"  Once Upon a Time season 7 spoilers: Plot details revealed  The sixth season finale offered a tease as to what to expect for season seven, as it appears that adult Henry has lost his belief in fairy tales – a clear (and intentional) parallel to the start of Emma\\'s journey in the pilot episode all those years ago.  \"Come on. Your family needs you,\" Lucy tells a very puzzled and sceptical Henry.  ABC/Jack Rowand  Previous fan theories speculated that Lucy\\'s mother could be Disney\\'s Moana or Narnia\\'s Lucy Pevensie, but she is actually none other than Cinderella (Dania Ramirez). Co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz have promised that it will be a proper love story and plays a huge part in the story for season seven.  \"Henry has left home and he wants to go and see other Storybrookes with different stories and different characters, and he obviously falls in love with Cinderella,\" showrunner Edward Kitsis shared.  \"Much like the romance his grandparents [Snow and Charming] had, what happens is what always happens, is he gets into trouble. And he calls up help from his family [Evil Queen, Hook, Rumplestiltskin].\"  ABC  Despite Henry having aged several years, Kitsis and Horowitz all but confirmed that returning characters Regina, Mr Gold, and Hook will remain the same age as before.  \"The age and how Henry is as old as he is without everyone else is dealt with right away as we set up the new paradigm,\" they said. \"I think it was purposefully oblique [in the season six finale] but we have a plan in place and we\\'re also allowing Rumple, Hook and the Evil Queen to be in it.\"  Regina, Mr Gold and Hook have had their happy endings, but what drags them back into the action? ABC released a statement as to what season seven will look like, promising that they will \"join forces\" with Henry and Lucy on another \"epic quest\".  ABC Getty Images/Digitalspy.com  \"Fairy tale characters new and old search for true love, find adventure, and once again take sides in the struggle of good against evil, as classic tales are once more twisted and reimagined,\" the description added.  And ABC exec Channing Dungey teased that Regina, Mr Gold and Hook will \"return but with new identities in a new city, facing a new curse\".  Indeed. That new city is Seattle, and we know bits and pieces about the trio\\'s new personas.  The cursed Regina is called Roni in Seattle, and she runs a bar.  ABC  \"I\\'m in denim and rock T-shirts,\" Parrilla said in an interview. \"When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she\\'s working in a bar. She\\'s a bar owner. She\\'s a little rough around the edges… This version feels really different. She\\'s no longer in charge.  \"I\\'m having a blast playing her. We\\'re all still discovering who she is. It\\'s refreshing, it\\'s different.\"  Roni will be getting a love interest, but it won\\'t be the most integral part of her arc this year.  We know much less about who Rumplestiltskin is, but Horowitz had this to say: \"He\\'s involved in many of the goings on in this neighbourhood in Seattle. We don\\'t want to say too much of the specifics of it, but it\\'s a lot of fun, and it\\'s another layer and colour for [Carlyle] to play.\"  ABC  As for Hook, he\\'s a cop named Rogers.  O\\'Donoghue said: \"I describe that there\\'s a sense of loss there in the guy and he just doesn\\'t know what it is that\\'s missing. He\\'s striving in some way to find who he is still, yet the Hook that we meet is trying to be the best uniform cop that he can be and do the right thing.\"  But wait, how are the writers going to explain why Emma is not alongside Hook? Some fans are fearing that Emma will be killed off (especially since Jennifer Morrison will be back for one episode – the second episode). Is there any truth to that? Kitsis and Horowitz are remaining coy.  \"There\\'s nothing to say,\" Kitsis said. \"That is correct, she is coming back for an episode. Their happiness is real, and people should enjoy that.\"  ABC  Whatever happens, Hook will not be having a new love interest anytime soon.  \"I think that Emma is absolutely Hook\\'s soulmate that we saw – so the Hook we all know and love, how could he look elsewhere?\" Kitsis added at Disney\\'s D23 expo in July, while Horowitz interestingly teased: \"We can\\'t say whether or not they have a child, but we can tell you we answer that question in the beginning of the season.\"  But the showrunners have assured fans that the show will have a very familiar feel to it, even with the cast shake-up and a move away from Storybrooke.  ABC/Jack Rowand  \"We\\'re trying to tell the same kind of stories and honor the DNA of what Once Upon a Time was from the very start,\" Horowitz explained. \"While there are some characters returning and some not returning, it\\'s still the same universe, and it\\'s still the same kind of storytelling.  \"It\\'s just that we\\'re going to be coming at it from a little bit of a different angle. It\\'s not going to be necessarily Storybrooke-based.\"  Horowitz later said that flashbacks will remain a significant part of the show. \"That\\'s one of the great advantages of having characters who can be hundreds of years old, we can span different eras and do many different things,\" he said.  ABC  Meanwhile, there will be a \"prominent\" LGBTQ storyline this season, which sounds awesome.  \"It\\'s going to look like any other relationship we\\'ve had on the show,\" Horowitz told BuzzFeed. \"It\\'s not going to be any different other than the fact that it\\'s LGBT. It\\'s important to us that it [Hyperion Heights] does reflect the world that exists. It feels normal.\"  Lana Parrilla has said that she\\'d be interested in seeing Star Wars invade the Once universe, adding that she would love to face off against Darth Vader, one of cinema\\'s most iconic villains.  \"It would just be fun, I think, to just battle him,\" she said. \"I\\'ve seen crazy fan art with the Evil Queen versus Darth Vader and they\\'re both holding lightsabers. I would just love that.\"  But don\\'t expect the Evil Queen\\'s infertility to be revisited. Parrilla shut down that fan theory at Comic-Con.  Disney ABC/DigitalSpy  Lastly, there\\'s a fan campaign – retweeted by de Ravin – to dedicate the season seven premiere to Georgina Callander, one of the victims in the devastating Manchester Arena terror attack on May 22, 2017.  Georgina, 18, was a Once Upon a Time superfan and met stars including Parrilla, de Ravin, and Mader one month before she tragically lost her life.  Once Upon a Time season 7 episodes  Season 7 episode 1: What happened in \\'Hyperion Heights\\'?  Jared S Gilmore briefly reprises his role as young Henry – hopping on August\\'s motorcycle and insisting to Regina that he will be fine, as he sets off to explore new realms.  A few years pass, with Andrew J West playing the adult version of Henry. In the Magical Forest, a near-collision on the road causes Henry and a previously-unseen version of Cinderella (Dania Ramirez) to meet.  Cinderella takes Henry\\'s bike and dagger in a quest to kill the prince for revenge. Henry tries to convince her to come with him to his realm. Cinderella backs out of killing the prince, but her evil stepmother Lady Tremaine does it anyway and frames Cinderella for the crime.  Henry decides to stay in the Magical Forest realm after finding one of Cinderella\\'s glass slippers just before he is set to leave.  ABC  In the present day, Henry lives in a Seattle neighbourhood named \\'Hyperion Heights\\' while affected by a new curse.  Regina (Roni), Hook (Rogers), and Rumplestiltskin (Weaver) are all victims of the curse as well, having had their memories wiped, as Henry\\'s daughter Lucy (and also the daughter of Jacinda – Cinderella\\'s alter ego in Hyperion Heights) pays a visit in an attempt to break the spell.  Meanwhile, Victoria Belfrey (aka Cinderella\\'s wicked stepmother Lady Tremaine) is looking to gentrify the neighbourhood and attempts to pressure Roni into selling her bar. Roni resists.  Season 7 episode 2: What happened in \\'A Pirate\\'s Life\\'?  Flashbacks see Jennifer Morrison reprise her role as Emma Swan, and the episode reveals why Hook is in Hyperion Heights but not Emma. It turns out that the Hook in Hyperion Heights is actually the Hook from the Wish Realm.  When Henry uses a magic bottle to ask Emma, Hook, and Regina for help, Wish Hook also answers Henry\\'s call and initially takes original Hook\\'s place.  But after Emma arrives and reveals that she is pregnant, Wish Hook comes clean and reveals the truth about his daughter: she has been trapped in a tower by a witch.  Henry decides to continue on his journey – accompanied by Wish Hook and Regina – while Emma and original Hook return to Storybrooke.  ABC  In Hyperion Heights, Victoria hires Rogers and Weaver to force Henry out of Hyperion Heights – but Rogers helps Henry instead. Rogers, Henry, and Roni agree to form an alliance to put an end to Victoria\\'s scheming.  Season 7 episode 3: What happened in \\'The Garden of Forking Paths\\'?  In flashbacks, Cinderella, Henry, Regina, and Hook team up with Princess Tiana (the leader of a resistance group) in the fight against Lady Tremaine.  Cinderella secretly confronts Lady Tremaine. Tremaine reveals that she has preserved the body ofher own daughter Anastasia, and that she hopes to revive Anastasia with the heart of the truest believer. That heart is, of course, Henry\\'s. Tremaine says that she will spare Cinderella (and the resistance) if Cinderella deliver\\'s Henry\\'s heart.  Regina stops Cinderella from acting on this before it\\'s too late.  In Hyperion Heights, Victoria has plans to replace the community garden with a new building, and Jacinda attempts to stop this by getting people to sign a petition.  Lucy believes Victoria is looking for something at the garden, and her suspicions seem to be well-founded when she finds a piece of Cinderella\\'s glass slipper in the tunnels, which she gives to Henry as proof that Jacinda is Cinderella.  Victoria/Tremaine – who it turns out isn\\'t cursed – eventually finds Anastasia\\'s preserved body. It is also revealed that she is holding a witch captive and demands her to use a spell to take Lucy\\'s belief away in order to resurrect Anastasia. The witch says no, saying there would be consequences.  Season 7 episode 4: What happened in \\'Beauty\\'?  In flashbacks, Rumplestiltskin and Belle spend a number of years looking for a way to lift the Dark One curse from Rumplestiltskin, so he can become mortal and they can live the rest of their lives together.  Belle finds a prophecy, leading them to build a home at a place called the Edge of Realms. Rumplestiltskin and Belle live together here, but Belle – ageing and dying – reveals that she figured out a while ago that the prophecy actually means that her death will lead Rumplestiltskin to begin his journey to rid himself of the Darkness.  ABC  After Belle\\'s death, Rumplestiltskin sets off to find the person who he can pass the Darkness onto – a mysterious Guardian.  In Hyperion Heights, Tilly (Alice in Wonderland) briefly wakes up from the curse and tries to convince Weaver that he is Rumplestiltskin, even shooting him to prove that he is immortal. Weaver remembers, and believe that Tilly will play an important part in reuniting him with Belle.  Season 7 episode 5: What happened in \\'Greenbacks\\'?  In the past, Tiana helps a man named Robert to reunite with his lover: a frog. The true love\\'s curse is broken as Robert kisses the frog. In a slight twist, Robert is actually a frog, and transforms back into one to be with his true love.  In Hyperion Heights, Rogers gets a lead on his missing daughter, whose name is Eloise Gardener. He interrogates a man with a tattoo that is linked to Eloise, but is forced to release him. This man is later on the phone, informing a mystery person that somebody is looking for the girl.  Also, Ivy turns out not to be cursed. She is plotting with the witch in the tower against her mother Victoria.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Alastair Jamieson  LONDON — Meghan Markle’s father, Thomas, will not attend her wedding to Prince Harry, the bride-to-be said in a statement Thursday.  The American actress confirmed earlier media reports that her father would not be able to walk her down the aisle on Saturday. TMZ reported that he needed heart surgery.  “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,” she said in the statement, which was released by Kensington Palace. “I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\"  Markle, a Los Angeles native, added: “I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  The announcement came as a full carriage procession and military rehearsal got underway in Windsor, England, where Markle, 36, will marry Harry, 33, at St. George\\'s Chapel.  Her mother, Doria Ragland, is still due to attend and meet her soon-to-be in-laws before the ceremony.  The American TV audience for the royal wedding is expected to exceed the 23 million Americans who tuned in for Prince William\\'s wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011.  However, some 17 percent of Brits want to get rid of their monarchy, according to a poll.',\n",

       " 'Transcript: NPR\\'s Full Interview With Sen. Marco RubioSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is running for president and spoke with NPR\\'s Steve Inskeep on Monday ahead of his big announcement.Rubio talked about how he hopes to stand out in the 2016 presidential field, Indiana\\'s religious freedom law, the president\\'s deal with Iran, immigration policy, and America\\'s warming relationship with Cuba.STEVE INSKEEP: In all the years I\\'ve been interviewing people, I don\\'t think I\\'ve spoken with somebody on the day of an announcement like this. And I was thinking that if it were me, there might be a moment the night before where I was lying awake wondering if I was really ready for this. Did you have a moment of wondering if you were really ready for this?SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Not last night, but, I mean, if you reach the point where you\\'re wondering it the night before you announce, then you probably shouldn\\'t run. I think anyone who\\'s thinking about the highest office in the most powerful nation on earth has to spend some time analyzing whether they\\'re prepared for the job. And look, I think the job is perhaps the most difficult job in politics anywhere in the world. You\\'re the leader of the most powerful military on the planet. You make decisions that have global implications. And it\\'s happening at a time when the country\\'s going through an extraordinary economic transformation that is leaving many people insecure. But from all that and given both my experience at the local, state and federal level, and especially the lessons learned over the last five years as I\\'ve been engaged in federal policy making, I\\'m very confident that I have the judgment and the knowledge that I need to do a very good job as president of the United States. And clearly, as you see the history of the presidency, people who go into that office grow, the office helps you grow as well as you go through it and that\\'s, having the ability to learn is a big part of the office as well. But I\\'m certainly capable from day 1. I\\'m very confident that I have the capability from day no. 1 to lead this country.Are you also affirming that you are not giving up your — are you also affirming that you are not running for Senate?I am not. And the reason I think strongly about that is, if you\\'ve decided that you want to serve this country as its president, that\\'s what you should be running for. And I find myself in a situation where my Senate seat comes up for re-election at the exact same time as the presidency. And by Florida law, you can\\'t run for both, anyway. But to even be thinking about a Plan B in case this doesn\\'t work, I think diminishes your ability to succeed on the campaign because your mind will always be on, if this doesn\\'t work, then I can do something else. And the truth is that, you know, I don\\'t want to be in politics my entire life. And I\\'m prepared to serve this country now in its highest office and I\\'m excited about this opportunity.You\\'ll be in a crowded Republican field. How do you expect to distinguish yourself from your opponents on the Republican side?Well, I expect that I\\'m going to go out and tell people my vision for the future of this country. I\\'m going to be very specific and detailed about our plans and how we\\'re going to get there. In fact, I\\'ve done that already. We have a very detailed policy position that we\\'ve outlined on numerous issues over the last two years, culminating in my book that just came out earlier this year, American Dreams. And I think from that, voters are going to analyze the different position of the candidates, their capabilities, their history, but more importantly their view of the future and their plans to get us there and I\\'m very confident that that will lead to success.Is there a sentence that people can have in their heads? Marco Rubio is different from the others because...He has the clear view of how the 21st century can also be an American century.We\\'re in a moment where you have put out plans proposing to reshape the way the federal government deals with federal assistance to the poor.Yes.We\\'re in a moment where Jeb Bush, who may also run, has a superPAC called Right to Rise. And this week, of course, Hillary Clinton declared her campaign for the presidency talking about helping everyday people. What\\'s going on there?Well, that\\'s a good thing for our country because equality of opportunity has always defined us as a people and as a nation. And the fact that there are millions of people now in America that are starting to have significant doubts about whether we\\'re still that kind of country should be deeply concerning to us. Our identity is at stake. Every country in the world has rich people. What makes America different is, we\\'ve had millions and millions of people who through hard work and perseverance are able to achieve happiness and upward mobility. And the fact that that\\'s in danger and in question is deeply concerning, and should be. It threatens our identity. So I\\'m glad that people are talking about it. Ultimately, talking about it won\\'t be enough. You have to have plans that work to help us address it. And for me it begins by embracing and acknowledging the reality that we are living through a massive transformation into this post-industrial 21st century economy that is both disruptive but also exciting. It comes not just with challenges, but also with opportunities. But we can only embrace those opportunities if we move forward on thinking about the changes we\\'re going to have to make in order to fully enter the 21st century.What\\'s one way that your approach would be different from Jeb Bush\\'s or Hillary Clinton\\'s?Well, as far as the Republican field is concerned, there will be plenty of time for comparison shopping. The truth is, for voters, the truth is that at this moment most of my opponents in the field beyond talking about upward mobility have not clearly outlined what they would do. We have a clear policy outline on each of these issues that people can read about. And if, you know, all of my opponents and other candidates in the Republican field choose to adopt some of those ideas, I\\'ll consider that a victory as well as flattery. But on the Democratic side, I think, you know, Hillary Clinton is someone who\\'s deeply wedded to the institutions of the 20th century. Her plans are to spend more money on the existing higher education system. That system doesn\\'t work any more. It doesn\\'t work any more because we don\\'t graduate enough young people from high school ready to work. We need to do more of that — ready to work in trades as mechanics, airplane technicians and plumbers and engineers. These are good — welders. These are good 21st century jobs and we are capable of teaching people how to do that so at 18, 19 years of age, they can be employed. We also need to have more flexible, more flexibility in higher education for working Americans who can\\'t afford to drop everything and go to school full-time for four years. We need to have programs that allow someone who works full time to learn at their own pace, on their own time, so that a receptionist can become a paralegal, so that the home-health aide making $10 an hour can become a dental hygienist making $55,000 a year. And then we have to have more quality measures in higher education. For example, before you take out a student loan—MhmmI have a bill that says every student, before you take out a student loan, needs to be told how much you can expect to make when you graduate from that school with the degree you\\'re pursuing so you can make an informed decision about whether or not it\\'s worth it to borrow a bunch of money for that degree.A Florida political reporter noticed that you spent a plane ride sitting beside Jeb Bush, more than two hours, coming back from an NRA convention. Did you guys talk about the presidential campaign at all?Not in great detail. Jeb and I are friends, we\\'ll always be friends. And I have tremendous admiration for him as a person, what he did as governor, and personal affection. And that\\'s not going to change. I don\\'t view, I\\'m not running against Jeb Bush and I\\'m not running against anybody in this field. I\\'m running because I strongly believe that I have something to offer this country that no one else in the field does at this moment in our history. And I\\'m going to go out there and do the best job that I can and — but, I mean, that\\'s not going to impact our relationship in any way that\\'s going to change how we feel about one another and it was great to see him and spend quality time just talking about good times and everything going on ...You didn\\'t talk politics very much at all?... and everything in between. Sure, I mean we had observations about — we joked with a lot of the passengers who saw us sitting next to each other and we took some pictures with people and we told them, we warned them how historic a picture like that may be one day. And, um, but you know, we talked about the Masters, we talked about the Paleo diet, we talked about the Miami Dolphins. I mean it, we talked about, reminisced about old war stories from our time in the legislature, when I was in the legislature and he was governor. It was just a host of things.Sooner or later if you go forward and he goes forward, there\\'s going to be a moment where you\\'re going to have to say, \"Here\\'s why it should be me and not him.\"I don\\'t know. I mean, I think this year\\'s going to be quite different in that regard. We have a quality field of candidates who are going to be well financed and experienced, who are going to be running. And I think that\\'ll change the nature of the race. There\\'ll certainly be moments when others will try to draw distinctions. But in my mind, I\\'m going to talk about who I am and what I want to do. And I\\'ll let voters make the decision about who they think is best capable at this moment of leading our country.You scheduled an announcement at Miami\\'s Freedom Tower, which has historic significance because Cubans who fled Fidel Castro\\'s regime in the 60s and 70s received federal aid there. This brings to mind that you have strongly criticized President Obama\\'s restoration of relations with Cuba. If you\\'re elected, would you reverse that policy?Absolutely, and I think the reason why is because I\\'m interested in, my interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy. I think the Cuban people, they are free, have the right to choose any economic model they want to follow. I don\\'t believe these changes will actually further democracy. In fact, I think they will make it harder to achieve. The goal of the Castro regime is to create the impression and the reality that their form of government is a legitimate form of government and set it in concrete. They know they have a generational challenge. Most of their top leaders are in their 80s. The actuarial tables tell you they don\\'t have much longer. And they want to leave in place global recognition for this form of government so that it can continue in perpetuity. And that means the Cuban people will never have the chance to experience what the people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti have, what the people in Mexico have, what the people in Peru have, what the people in Colombia have, which is free and fair elections. And that\\'s all I want for the people in Cuba. And I think U.S. policy towards Cuba is a major leverage point that we can use to help the Cuban people achieve freedom for themselves.But help me think through this. The president made this announcement, they\\'re working on getting an embassy going at some point in the future. He went to Summit of the Americas where other countries in Latin America very much welcomed the restoration of relations. You\\'re saying that if you\\'re elected, you would close that embassy, you would break diplomatic ties, you would go back to the way things were?We have an interest section in Cuba and it will continue to operate, but an embassy, I\\'m not, I don\\'t believe this country should be diplomatically recognizing a nation of the nature of Cuba. Obviously there are other dictatorships in the world that we have relations with by geopolitical reality. You know, China\\'s the largest country in the world, the second largest economy, the second largest military force. There are geopolitical realities there. Cuba is a brutal, tyrannical dictatorship 90 miles from the shore of our country. It is a nation that helps North Korea evade U.N. weapon sanctions. It is a country that harbors fugitives from American justice, including Medicare fraudsters and someone who killed a police officer in the United States. And I just think that we should have continued with the policy and perhaps looked for new ways of — continue with the policy of not recognizing that regime and not allowing them access to economic growth that would allow them to perpetuate themselves in power, and continue to search for ways to provide the Cuban people with more information about the reality of the world so they would be empowered to eventually create for themselves a democratic society.You\\'ve also said that you would reverse the president\\'s deal with Iran, assuming that that is finalized. You said you would absolutely do that. What would that look like on day one?Well, I would not adhere — well, we have to understand the deal, basically, can be what it is on paper. What the president is banking on is that he\\'s going to use a national security waiver to lift the sanctions on Iran, the economic sanctions that now exist. And we would simply re-impose the sanctions. And I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal\\'s even viable. The Iranians are now saying that what we\\'re saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things. This issue of them asking for immediate relief of sanctions the minute the deal is signed is going to be a deal breaker. I hope it would be a deal break for this administration. And at the end of the day, we need to recognize that what Iran is trying to do here, and this is clear to anyone who has inside knowledge into this or has followed it closely, Iran is trying to maintain all the infrastructure they need to be nuclear capable without agreeing to any irreversible concessions. And that seems to be what they have achieved, if in fact this moves forward. So in my mind, we would just reinstitute the sanctions.But I\\'m just thinking this through. The deal is made. It\\'s made not just with the United States, but with the European allies. Would you move forward with re-imposing sanctions even if the Europeans don\\'t go along with it?Yes, it wouldn\\'t be as effective, obviously. We would, ultimately, I think, the Europeans are going to have a test anyway because the Iranians are going to violate the sanctions at some point. They\\'re going to evade it either by trying to take advantage of loopholes in the deal, or they\\'ll just flat out evade it because they\\'ve always had a secret component to their, to their program. And at that point, they\\'re going to have a huge test on their hands, which is, are they willing to live by the agreement that they even signed on to? But from the United States\\' perspective, while we want our allies to join us in this endeavor, and certainly sanctions against Iran would be more effective were they in conjunction with our allies around the world, we have to look out for our own national security concerns. And in my mind, if the president wanted this to be a permanent deal that survived his presidency, he would have brought it to Congress.I\\'m just thinking through further, though, as part of this deal, assuming it\\'s finalized, the Iranians get rid of a vast amount of enriched uranium, almost all they have. They limit the amount of enrichment that they will have. They limit the number of centrifuges they will operate and they will allow inspections for decades, actually. So you would say, all that, forget about it, it\\'s done.They would retain all the infrastructure, first of all, they ...They retain infrastructure, sure.They retain not only just infrastructure, they retain centrifuges, too. They may not be spinning them, but they will retain them in their possession. They continue to develop their long range missile capabilities, which are unstopped. There\\'s no prohibition on them acquiring a weapon design as they probably, may even already have. They continue to sponsor terrorism all over the world. In fact, now they\\'ll have more funding to pay for it, in places they already control, places like Beirut. They\\'re increasingly active in Yemen. Their hand and their role\\'s clear in Bahrain and in a growing number of places around the world. And they continue to be run by a radical Shia cleric who has apocalyptic views of the future and of their role in it. So none of these things change. Their infrastructure will remain in place and at some point, they could follow the North Korean model very easily, which is they can cook up an excuse for why they need to have a weapon program and move forward on it.Is war inevitable then?I hope not. My hope is that we can delay a program long enough and you would hope that there would be some sort of change in leadership in Iran that would at least allow them to decide that they would rather have an economy than have a weapon. You can\\'t guarantee it. But at the end of the day no one wants war, but I actually think that this deal could advance the prospects of war. I think this deal and the fact that Iran will retain nuclear infrastructure increases the likelihood that one of their neighbors may take action against them, whether it\\'s Israel or the Saudis or someone else. It also increases the likelihood now, that Iran becomes even more aggressive in its proxy wars that it\\'s conducting all over the world. It also increases the likelihood that they\\'ll increase their conventional capabilities threatening our U.S. presence in the region. And ultimately I think it almost guarantees an arms race in the region, because the Saudis have made very clear, and others, the Egyptians as well, that whatever Iran has, they\\'ll get as well. So if Iran is allowed to enrich to a certain level, they will begin doing the same, requiring a capability to do the same.Let me ask about a domestic issue. In recent weeks, the state of Indiana passed a Religious Freedom law, which was interpreted by many as discrimination, by others, as protection for people who don\\'t want to take part in gay marriage. You defended the law and spoke about the hypothetical example of a florist who was asked to participate in a gay marriage and wanted to refuse. You said that person should have the right to follow their religious beliefs. Indiana, though, has since changed the law. Do you still support that concept?Well, to be fair, I haven\\'t read the change in detail to give you an opinion on it specifically, but I\\'ll tell you where I stand. I don\\'t believe you can discriminate against people. So I don\\'t believe it\\'s right for a florist to say, I\\'m not going to provide you flowers because you\\'re gay. I think there\\'s a difference between not providing services to a person because of their identity, who they are or who they love, and saying, I\\'m not going to participate in an event, a same-sex wedding, because that violates my religious beliefs. There\\'s a distinction between those two things. So, certainly, you can\\'t not — it\\'s immoral and wrong to say, I\\'m not going to allow someone who\\'s gay or lesbian to use my restaurant, stay in my hotel, or provide photography service to them because they\\'re gay. The difference here is, we\\'re not talking about discriminating against a person because of who they are, we\\'re talking about someone who\\'s saying — what I\\'m talking about, anyway, is someone who\\'s saying, I just don\\'t want to participate as a vendor for an event, a specific event that violates the tenets of my faith.What if two gay people get married and then they go that night to a hotel. Can the hotelkeeper refuse service to them?That\\'s not part of an event. Again, I mean, that\\'s, there\\'s a difference between saying, we\\'re not going to allow you to stay in our hotel, common lodging establishment where people have a right to shelter, food, medical care, and saying we\\'re not going to, what we\\'re not going to do is provide services to an event, to an actual event, which is the wedding itself. And I think that\\'s the distinction point that people have been pointing to, and, because mainstream Christianity teaches that marriage is between one man and one woman. People feel very strongly about that. And to ask someone to individually provide services to something of that nature, I think violates their religious liberty.There\\'s a big question lurking here, which is that most Americans, according to surveys, now support gay marriage. A large minority of Americans still oppose gay marriage. The question is, that people seem to be wrestling with, is, what ground do opponents of gay marriage have left to stand on? What ground should they have to stand on?First of all, if the majority of Americans support gay marriage, then you\\'ll see it reflected in changes in state law, which has always regulated marriage. And so at the end of the day, if a majority of people in any given state in this country petition their legislature to change the definition of marriage to include the marriage of two people of the same sex, that\\'ll be the law of the land. And that is what it is. Separate from that, there\\'s a constitutional protection of religious liberty that allows people to live by the tenets of their faith both in their public and in private life. That doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re allowed to go in and disrupt a gay wedding. But by the same token, it doesn\\'t mean that someone\\'s allowed to come to you and force you to be a participant in a ceremony that violates the tenets of your faith. And to be honest, in the real world, 99.9% of the time, a same-sex couple doesn\\'t want a florist or a photographer at their wedding that doesn\\'t agree with the choice that they\\'ve made. So we\\'re really talking about an issue that in large part is really not going to manifest itself in daily life, but in the instances that it does, there are individuals that don\\'t want to be compelled by force of law to participate in an event that puts them in the position of violating their religious faith. There\\'s a difference between that and discriminating against an individual because of who they are.Are there are other specific situations on your mind where you feel that people who are opposed to gay marriage would need some kind of protection from, from it?Well, I mean, that\\'s the one that\\'s in the news today. Again, I don\\'t, we can always sit here and engage in hypotheticals, this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, I mean, that\\'s the one that\\'s emerged because there\\'s real cases behind people being fined for not providing services to a, to a ceremony as opposed to individuals.When we spoke last year, we talked about immigration, an issue on which you worked for a time on an immigration reform bill. You said, first, the reason to do that is not political, it\\'s substantive. But, second, that there would be a political effect. That if the Republican Party deals with immigration, it would then have an opportunity to talk with Latino voters about other issues. And, of course, this is a voter group where Republicans have done very poorly in recent elections. Immigration hasn\\'t been dealt with. What are the likely consequences for the Republican party in 2016?Well, again, every candidate has a different position on where they stand on the issue. From my perspective, I continue to believe it\\'s an issue we need to address. The only point I\\'ve made is that I think the lessons of the last couple of years, for me, is that we\\'re not going to be able to deal with it in one big piece of legislation. I still think we need to do immigration reform. I just don\\'t think you can do it in a comprehensive, massive piece of legislation, given the lack of trust that there is today in the federal government. I honestly believe that the key to moving forward on immigration is to first and foremost prove to the American people that we are going to bring future illegal immigration under control — that if we legalize 12 million people, they won\\'t be replaced by 12 million more who are here illegally. And I honestly believe, given my experiences on this issue now, that if we did that, the American people and the majority of Republicans and conservatives will be very reasonable and, and responsible about how we address the reality that we have 12 million human beings living in this country illegally.But we\\'re in a circumstance, granted there\\'s still time, but we\\'re in a circumstance where it doesn\\'t look like immigration legislation is going to get through Congress before 2016. What does that mean for your party?And I think, I think it\\'s nearly – well, I just outlined to you what I think the key is to moving forward. And I think that\\'s impossible as long as Barack Obama\\'s president now, because on two instances, particularly very recently, last year, he issued an executive order ordering federal agencies not to enforce immigration law. So if I\\'m telling you that the key to moving forward is the enforcement of immigration law, then that says the notion that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, and you have a president that\\'s ordering agencies not to enforce immigration law, our ability to convince people, no matter what we pass, that future illegal immigration will be brought under control, as long as Barack Obama\\'s president, is nil.How do you keep from getting hammered on that in a general election where the Hispanic vote may be very important?Well, I don\\'t know about the others, but I\\'ve done more immigration than Hillary Clinton ever did. I mean, I helped pass an immigration bill in a Senate dominated by Democrats. And that\\'s more than she\\'s ever done. She\\'s given speeches on it, but she\\'s never done anything on it. So I have a record of trying to do something on it. It didn\\'t work because at the end of the day, we did not sufficiently address the issue of, of illegal immigration and I warned about that throughout that process, as well, that I didn\\'t think we were doing enough to give that bill a chance of moving forward in the House.Does your biography help?I think biography\\'s part of all of our lives, all of our candidacies, because it certainly influences how you view the country and how you view issues. I have a personal attachment to the working class because it\\'s where I come from, it\\'s still the neighborhood I live in, it\\'s the people my children go to school with, it\\'s the community that I\\'m involved in. And, but I also happen to think it\\'s the identity of our country. And every candidate, you know, will bring to bear their experiences in life and how it\\'s guided them and influenced their thinking, but from my perspective, I think it matters simply because it informs me on my policy decisions.There\\'s a big question here, also, because the Republican party, as many people have noted, faces a demographic challenge that gets a little worse with every election cycle. Growing groups in society, such as Latinos and others, are voting increasingly Democratic, and Republican voter groups, particularly older white voters, are getting smaller. What\\'s the Republican Party need to do about that?Well, at the end, I don\\'t think people go to the ballot box and say, I\\'m a Latino, therefore I\\'m voting Democrat. I think they bring with them their hopes and fears about the future, and they vote for whoever they think best understands them. And the challenge the Republican Party has had is unfairly, but it\\'s the reality, they\\'ve been portrayed as a party that doesn\\'t care about people who are trying to make it. A disproportionate number of people who are trying to make it, who are working class, who are out there working for a living at $18 an hour, $15 an hour, happen to also be people from minority communities. And if you think someone doesn\\'t care or understand people like you, no matter what your policies are, it\\'s going to be difficult to get them to listen to you, much less vote for you. And so I hope the Republican Party can become the champion of the working class because I think our policy proposals of limited government and free enterprise are better for the people who are trying to make it than big government is. The fact is that big government helps the people who have made it. If you can afford to hire an army of lawyers, lobbyists and others to help you navigate and sometimes influence the law, you\\'ll benefit. And so that\\'s why you see big banks, big companies, keep winning. And everybody else is stuck and being left behind.So you\\'re beginning this gigantic game of Survivor with who knows how many other candidates. You\\'re smiling as I say that. With who knows how many other candidates, what will determine who survives ultimately and how will you make sure it\\'s you?Well, there are basics about any campaign. Obviously you\\'ll have to put time into it, you\\'ll have to be able to raise sufficient funds to communicate your message. And on a daily basis, you have to make sure you do the best you can to help convince people in a crowded field that you\\'re the best person at this time for the job that you seek. But beyond it, I really think the key is, who can inspire our country into believing that the future doesn\\'t have to be worse than our past, that the 21st century can be better than the 20th. And then once you\\'ve inspired them to believe that, showing them how we can accomplish it. And I feel very confident in our ability to do it and I think that\\'s why we\\'re going to win.Should I think of this as an insurgent campaign, because you don\\'t have the resources of Jeb Bush, particularly?Well, I think our resources will be sufficient to do the job we\\'re trying to do. At the end of the day, this is not a fundraising competition in and of itself. You also have to have a message and a messenger and a policy outline that proves to people that, that your campaign is better for them than what someone else is offering. But I\\'m certainly not the frontrunner and — but that\\'s O.K. The election isn\\'t tomorrow.What are you doing to make sure you don\\'t run out of money?(Laughs) We\\'re going to, we, we\\'re trying to raise as much money as we can and that\\'s important. As long as the media outlets keep charging us for advertising, we\\'ll have to keep raising money.Senator Rubio, thanks very much.Thank you.',\n",

       " \"Before Luann D’Agostino announced that she and husband Tom D’Agostino were divorcing after only 7 months of marriage, the Real Housewives of New York City opened up to her cast mates and to host Andy Cohen about what, if anything, would cause her to leave him.  On the RHONY reunion part 1, which was filmed three weeks before the couple officially split, the 52-year-old former countess was once again faced with rumors of Tom’s infidelities from her fellow New York City Housewives — this time allegedly taking place after the couple had said their “I dos.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Of course, Luann has a lot of experience knocking down these sorts of claims, having spent two seasons on the hit Bravo show defending their whirlwind romance. But on the reunion, Luann showed a more vulnerable side — admitting that it alarms her to hear the constant rumors.  Asked what she would do if those claims ended up having validity, Luann gave a swift answer.  “I would definitely leave,” she said in a clip of the reunion released Wednesday morning. “I would. After I kill him. I’d kill him first and then I’d leave. You can push me so far but once you push me over the line…”  Luann D'Agostino Bravo  Said allegations appeared to be true only once, when Tom, 50, was caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel’s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before their engagement party. Luann forgave her then-finacé and has maintained he’s been faithful since their lavish New Years Eve ceremony in Palm Beach — despite his flirtatious personality and “hot mic” moments on the show (including a scene in which he referred to himself as a “dog with a collar” while chatting with an ex at a party).  “I admit his humor is a little off,” Luann said on the reunion, indicating that she understood how Tom — who was a lifelong bachelor before they wed — came off on the show.  Tom and Luann D'Agostino Robin Marchant/Getty  The reality star also revealed that she did not have an open relationship with Tom, telling Cohen, “I’m not interesting in an open relationship otherwise I wouldn’t be married.”  Her comments may not have convinced her RHONY costars. “You stayed with Alex all those years,” Sonja Morgan said of Luann’s first husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, whom Luann had previously said cheated on her.  “Well, that was different,” said Luann. “You see we were separated and I didn’t really want anyone to know.”  FROM PEN: Highlights from Luann de Lesseps & Tom D’Agostino Jr.’s Wedding  Luann announced on Twitter Aug. 3 that she and Tom were divorcing. “It’s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,” she wrote. “We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!”  Days later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.  “I do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,” Luann told Page Six on Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. “God knows he’s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don’t believe that continued [while we were married].”  ”It was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,” she continued. “It was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren’t getting along.”  Part 1 of The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\",\n",
       " 'DUN DUN DUN. “Oh baby, baby ... ”. In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R&B grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie & the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music’s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.  Without it, there would by no Christina Aguilera, no Katy Perry, no Charli XCX; Taylor Swift would probably still be singing country songs, and Eminem – who arrived in 1999 – would not have had as much to rail against. Released in the wake of Alanis Morissette’s hugely successful 1995 album Jagged Little Pill and its litany of imitators, it presented a different angle to the prevalent idea of female angst; this was gloriously OTT teen girl longing, encapsulated by a lyric – “My loneliness is killing me” – that feels depressingly evergreen. “The whole song is about that stress that we all go through as teens,” Spears tells me. “I knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, [but] I don’t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.”  In a Sliding Doors-esque moment that could have changed the world as we know it, …Baby One More Time very nearly didn’t get written at all, with the song’s melody bubbling up as Martin was drifting off to sleep. Having hauled himself out of bed to his nearby dictaphone, he sketched out the song. “I remember listening back to [the tape] after [the song] blew up and you can hear me sort of go: ‘Hit me baby one more time’, then I hear myself say, Yeah, it’s pretty good,’” the notoriously interview-shy Martin told Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall in 2016. Martin, convinced he’d written an R&B song (“Pop music with a flavour – what we call R&B in Sweden, what you guys [in America] say is pop,” he said in 1998), sent the song, then called Hit Me Baby (One More Time), to TLC who rejected it. “I was like: ‘I like the song but do I think it’s a hit? Do I think it’s TLC?’ … Was I going to say ‘Hit me baby one more time’? Hell no!” said T-Boz in 2013.  While TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin’s attempts at American slang, believing “hit me” could seamlessly replace “call me”. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower’s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin’s demo of what had now been renamed …Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five’s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell’s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. “You’re mad,” Cowell is reported to have said. “No one can be successful with a name like that.” As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. “It costs £95,000,” he added.  It was …Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making “Sheryl Crow music, but younger”, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears’s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he’s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no; she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston’s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R&B-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn’t on the horizon, A&R Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive’s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. “I was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,” she says, “but he was so nice and put me right at ease.” For Martin, his song had finally found its home.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Maxed out: Spears and Martin, 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage  From New York, Spears de-camped to Martin’s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. “I remember being so in awe of Stockholm,” Spears says. “I was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn’t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.” The song’s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as “very shy and super sweet – I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look”. The sessions were intense, with four of the album’s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as “direct, effective, we don’t show off”, words reiterated by Yacoub. “A song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It’s all about the taste and making sure you don’t add more than what the song needs.”  For Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. “I really respect that when I’m working with him,” she says. “I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.”  Another person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It’s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for …Baby One More Time. “I remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,” she says. “I was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.” Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with …Baby One More Time Spears’s vocals were already recorded. “I tried to sound exactly like her,” she laughs. “It was hard, but a lot of fun. I’m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different; I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I’m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.”  With Britney’s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (“It took probably around two to three weeks to finish,” says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song’s October release. “The label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,” remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York’s Top 40 radio station WPXY. “This had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.” In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. “No other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.” For Ingram, …Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. “We’d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R&B cycle after that,” he explains. “Britney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest She’s so lucky: Britney in 1999. Photograph: ACTION PRESS/REX/Shutterstock  The song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999’s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. “I don’t think we understood what we had done,” Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. “I remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA … I had so much going on I didn’t really grasp the meaning of it”. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. “Max walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: ‘Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,’” he recalls. “I asked him when it had happened and he said: ‘Three weeks ago.’ We really didn’t focus on charts, we just kept working.” Even celebrations were muted. “It was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.”  An iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick’s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. “I wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,” Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears’s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV’s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.  The video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle’s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity – sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes; red PVC-clad dominatrix in the “not that innocent” Oops!…I Did It Again visual – was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? “Wow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur.”  Britney Spears plays Open Air Theatre, Scarborough, Friday 17 August; touring to 1 September',\n",
       " 'Image copyright EPA Image caption Rebel Wilson won a defamation lawsuit against Bauer Media last year  An Australian court has ordered actress Rebel Wilson to repay the majority of her record defamation payout from a magazine publisher.  Wilson had received A$4.7m (£2.6m; $3.5m) in damages and interest from Bauer Media over articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar.  But a court reduced the sum to A$600,000 earlier this month following an appeal by the publisher.  On Wednesday, Wilson was ordered to pay back A$4.1m and A$60,000 in interest.  She will also have to cover 80% of what Bauer spent on its appeal.  Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give all of her compensation to charity.  In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for film roles she had lost out on. She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.  However the size of the payout, Australia\\'s largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.  Ahead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.  The Victorian Court of Appeal ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on film roles.  The actress wrote on Twitter at the time: \"That\\'s now $4 million less going to less fortunate Australians and leaves a billionaire corporation, proven guilty of malicious defamation, being able to get away with their seriously harmful acts for a very low pay day.\"  The size of the original payout also generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism in the public interest.',\n",

Yeah, I\\'m mad at him,\" O\\'Reilly said Monday in a post on his website. \"I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn\\'t happen. I can\\'t explain it to you. If I die tomorrow and I get an opportunity, I\\'ll say \\'why\\'d you guys work me over like that? Didn\\'t know my children were going to be punished? And they\\'re innocent.\\'\"  The New York Times reported Saturday that O\\'Reilly paid $32 million to Lis Wiehl, a Fox News legal analyst who made regular appearances on O\\'Reilly\\'s show for 15 years, in a settlement related to sexual harassment allegations. Wiehl accused O\\'Reilly of \"repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her,\" the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.  On his website, O\\'Reilly denounced the report as a \"smear piece\" and said \"these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree.

That\\'s what this is all about.\"  More: Bill O\\'Reilly dismisses NYT report as \\'lies and smears\\'  More: Megyn Kelly complained to Fox execs about Bill O\\'Reilly\\'s sexual harassment stand  In April, the Times reported on five other settlements involving O\\'Reilly and women accusing him of sexual harassment. The revelation led to Fox News\\' decision to part ways with its star commentator.  On Monday, O\\'Reilly said that in more than 20 years he only \"resolved three situations\" and that he did it \"to protect my children from harm.\"  O\\'Reilly has repeatedly said the potential impact on his children is a major reason for his outrage over the Times report.  \"The pain it brings to my children is indescribable,\" O\\'Reilly told the Times when it interviewed him about the reported $32 million settlement. \"I would give up my life to protect my children, but I find myself unable to protect them because of things that are being said about me, their father.\"  \"This is horrible what I went through, horrible what my family went through,\" he continued. O\\'Reilly said the report was \"politically and financially motivated\" and that he could \"prove it with shocking information but I\\'m not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press.\"  O\\'Reilly invoked the memory of his former Fox News colleague Eric Bolling\\'s son, 19-year-old Eric Chase Bolling, who was found dead in an apartment while away at college. Fox News had just parted ways with Bolling amid sexual harassment allegations when his son died and O\\'Reilly seemed to say that was behind the teen\\'s death.  \"I urge you to think about what you put in your newspaper,\" O\\'Reilly told the Times reporters. \"Eric Bolling\\'s son is dead. Is dead, because of allegations made, in my opinion — and I know this to be true — against Mr. Bolling.\"  Separately, Bolling said in a statement that O\\'Reilly\\'s comment was \"beyond inappropriate\" and that his \"parting from Fox News was in no way connected to the tragic news of my son\\'s passing.\"  O\\'Reilly apologized to Bolling in a tweet. \"The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids.

       " 'CLOSE From the highly-anticipated \"She-Ra\" reboot to Robin Wright\\'s reign on \"House of Cards,\" here\\'s what\\'s coming to Netflix this November. USA TODAY  The final season of Netflix\\'s \"House of Cards\" debuts with Robin Wright as Claire Underwood, the new President of the United States after her husband\\'s resignation from the position. \"House\" is just one of the many series that examines the drama and comedy surrounding politicians in power. Here are a few more of our favorite political television shows. (Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix)  Netflix is dead. Long live Netflix.  This weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of \"House of Cards.\"  Canceling \"Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service\\'s first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless – no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.  It was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring \"Bloodline\" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza \"Sense8\" were among the service\\'s top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.  But that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.  The streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (\"Sugar Rush\") to foreign language sci-fi (\"Dark\") to preteen sobfests (\"Alexa and Katie\"). Sure, it\\'s still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don\\'t stick, including Marvel\\'s \"Luke Cage\" and acclaimed true-crime parody \"American Vandal.\"  Paris Berelc and Isabel May on \"Alexa & Katie.\" (Photo: Adam Rose/Netlix)  In this new world of Netflix, \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.  Almost from the moment it began unveiling original programming – known until then for reruns of series like \"How I Met Your Mother\" and \"Breaking Bad\" and mail-order DVDs – Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like \"Lilyhammer\" but Netflix\\'s big coming-out moment was \"Cards,\" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.  Not long after, prison dramedy \"Orange\" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women\\'s stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.  This image released by Netflix shows Taylor Schilling, left, and Uzo Aduba in a scene from \"Orange Is the New Black.\" (Photo: Paul Schiraldi, AP)  \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn\\'t need them anymore.  Sure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.  More: New on Netflix in November: \\'House of Cards,\\' \\'Narcos,\\' and plenty of Christmas films  The service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from \"Ozark\" to \"The Punisher.\" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its influence, look no further than the recently released \"Making a Murderer Part 2,\" which spends ample time outlining just how much the first chapter of the Netflix doc affected the media and the criminal justice system.  When Netflix launched original programming, it needed big, buzzy shows to make noise. But the streaming service is now one gigantic monster, hoarding hundreds of big, medium and little shows that cater to every possible interest. Want a baking show mixed with the a sense of the macabre? Try \"The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell.\" Want a cop comedy with a cast as seemingly random as Tony Danza and Josh Groban? There\\'s \"The Good Cop.\" Want to see pretty houses? Enjoy \"The World\\'s Most Extraordinary Homes.\"  Christine McConnell on \"The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell.\" (Photo: Netflix)  Netflix\\'s brand is everything, and its audience is everyone. \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" represent a tiny sliver of that vast canvas.  Viewers\\' main interest in the final season of \"Cards\" is how the show moves on after Spacey was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Had the actor not fallen from grace so publicly, \"Cards\" might have premiered its final episodes even more quietly. With so much else on Netflix\\'s welcome screen, \"Cards\" simply isn\\'t essential viewing anymore. On its release day this year it has to compete with a lost Orson Welles movie, a Mike Judge comedy special and two documentaries. Not to mention a Julia Roberts series a few clicks away on Netflix competitor Amazon Prime.  With every passing day, Netflix executives and their checkbooks turn their attention somewhere new. Its biggest priority now seems to be conquering the film industry. And the streamer certainly seems to be making progress on that front. It\\'s impossible to think of a new series this year that\\'s generated the same adoration and hype that greeted its mini-rom-com film slate, from teen sensation \"The Kissing Booth\" to the by-the-numbers \"Set It Up.\" Film pundits predict that Netflix might get its first best-picture Oscar nomination for Alfonso Cuaron\\'s \"Roma,\" due in theaters this month and on Netflix in December.  So here\\'s to \"Cards\" and \"Orange\" and the televised revolution they helped begin. It\\'s been a wild five years. It\\'s both exciting and terrifying to wonder what will happen in five more.

Like the crop tops and slip dresses made famous by a young Kate Moss, the oversized, fabric-wrapped hair bands made popular by the likes of Michelle Tanner and Lisa Turtle live on—whether you like it or not.  It’s true—they look dated, lacking the clean lines or indiscreet material to modernize your hairstyle. But they are a throwback—like an oversized denim jacket or mom jeans—and, therefore, have re-emerged as trendy once again. The way you style them, however, makes all the difference.',\n",
       " 'A day before Demi Lovato\\'s apparent drug overdose, the star and her \"new\" group of friends were reportedly on a \"binger\" and were prepared for extreme measures by having Narcan, an emergency medication that is used to revive people in instances of narcotic overdoses, on hand.  TMZ reported that Lovato, 25, refused to tell paramedics what drugs may have caused the overdose and was not cooperative with EMTs when they arrived at her home on Tuesday. A source told Fox News that \"it\\'s not heroin.\" According to the outlet, no drugs were found at the scene and no charges pressed.  People magazine reported that Lovato and her group of friends were prepared for their night of partying.  “She and her ‘friends’ were on a binger the entire night,” an insider told the outlet. “They keep Narcan on hand for such situations – they were prepared for this. The people she has been hanging around lately aren’t her real friends – they don’t have her best interests at heart. She’s pushed her true friends away.”  The source added, “She had to find creative and sneaky ways to get drugs because her team and those that really care about her really try to keep a close watch on her.”  Lovato\\'s long-time band guitarist, Mike Manning, spoke out about the singer\\'s new group of friends saying that he planned to expose all of those who were involved in Monday night\\'s \"binger\" and added, \"I almost lost my sister today.\"  \"Anybody who was with Demi last night and actually calls themselves a friend should actually be disgusted with themselves. SICK,\" Manning said according to the Daily Mail.  He added, \"You can never trust anyone. Never can know if your \"friends\" are truly on your side or not.\"  According to TMZ, Lovato\\'s longtime team attempted to stage an intervention to get help for the troubled singer but she \"blew them off.\" The news follows the departure of Lovato\\'s long-serving manager, Phil McIntyre, who was reportedly a part of the intervention.  Lovato had been preparing for a months-long string of performances set to start Thursday night in Atlantic City, N.J., and take her to venues as far as Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The singer\\'s Atlantic City concert has since been canceled.  Signs of trouble began in the days leading up to the overdose when a video of the singer forgetting the lyrics to her song \"Sober,\" surfaced online. Lovato wrote the single, released in late June, about relapsing after celebrating six years of sobriety.  Lovato\\'s profound \"Sober\" lyrics read, “Mama, I’m so sorry I’m not sober anymore/And Daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor. To the ones who never left me/We’ve been down this road before/I’m so sorry, I’m not sober anymore.”  Though Lovato has been vocal about her struggles throughout the years, another insider revealed to People that Lovato’s period of sobriety was full of ups and downs.  “Demi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons. She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time — and is still in such a dark place. She was sober for a while, but not completely sober for six years.”  The star, who is \"in stable condition\" and with her family at the hospital according to a statement from her rep, has also found support from her ex-boyfriend, former \"That 70\\'s Show\" star Wilmer Valderrama.  Valderrama, who dated Lovato for six years before their break up in June 2016, was reportedly “shocked” after hearing the news that Lovato was hospitalized on Tuesday.  “He knew she was going through a tough time but he wasn’t prepared for this,” a source told People. “He saw her through so many ups and downs and was her rock through some of her darkest moments. To see her back in such a sad and vulnerable place is heartbreaking for him.”  The source added that Valderrama, “always cared deeply” for Lovato and even after they split the two have remained friends.  So much so that Valderrama paid his ex a visit on Wednesday, according to People. The 38-year-old star visited Lovato in the hospital following her apparent overdose yesterday afternoon.  “Demi always hoped they would end up back together in the future,” a source revealed to the magazine. “He’s the love of her life and vice versa.”  Lovato remains in the hospital.',\n",

       " 'Photo-Illustration: Maya Robinson/Vulture and Netflix  The House of Cards writers were in the middle of crafting the final chapters of the show’s operatic showdown between President Claire Underwood and her estranged husband, former President Frank Underwood, when their real world collapsed. Co-showrunners Melissa James Gibson, Frank Pugliese, and the show’s five writers had been convening at their New York office since June 2017. They had finished writing 9 episodes and outlined 11 out of the 13 overall. While they hadn’t figured out how exactly the epic power battle between Claire (Robin Wright) and Frank (Kevin Spacey) would conclude, they were close. About 200 miles away in Baltimore, the first two episodes of the final season had been filmed. A powerful woman was the leader of the free world, and though it was fictional, there was a heightened energy on set because of it.  The writers were still debating one crucial detail — which Underwood would be left standing at the end of the season? — when rape and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein broke in the New York Times and The New Yorker in October. As news alerts buzzed on their phones daily, the writers wondered what other high-profile figure would tumble next. Three weeks later, BuzzFeed broke the news that Star Trek Discovery actor Anthony Rapp had accused Spacey of making unwanted sexual advances toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. The stunned writers, accustomed to working in isolation, were aware of every painful development in the news. “It was very surreal because, at the time, it was the very beginning of the #MeToo movement which was influencing our story and [within it,] what it was like to be president and female,” story editor Sharon Hoffman said. “Writers’ rooms are usually very insular; it’s an intimate, familial place in the best circumstances. But the bubble was broken.”  In less than a week’s time, more than a dozen men had accused Spacey, the two-time Oscar winner, of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and attempted rape. Netflix halted production on the series immediately. By November 3, the streaming giant cut all ties with Spacey, and the future of Netflix’s signature drama was in limbo. Supervising producer-writer Jerome Hairston described working in a “fugue state.” Story editor Tian Jun Gu, who started out on the show as a writer’s assistant in the third season, remembers how rattled the group was by the uncertainty, and how angered they felt by the notion that one man’s actions could topple the show and erase their hard work. It was a “gut punch,” Pugliese said, but the prospect of tossing out five months of work and having to rebuild the season without the show’s corrupt central figure actually emboldened him and his partner. “It felt so unfair to the story, in a way, we had to defend the world of the show,” Gibson said. Wright, who is also an executive producer on the show, agreed. “It was very important to all of us to keep the show going,” she said. “For the fans. To close out the story in full, the way we had always intended.”  The fifth season had ended with Claire’s total rejection of Frank and her declaration to viewers: “My turn.” For months, the story the writers were building around Claire was that of a female president confronting misogyny head-on and enduring hit after hit from the patriarchy, including death threats. Gibson thought it would be especially “perverse” for the story of a woman in power to be denied because of the actions of a man. “On a meta level, it just didn’t seem right to let things happening outside the show […] end the series that way,” Pugliese said.  Co-executive producer Jason Horwitch had traveled to Los Angeles for his wife’s birthday the weekend that Rapp’s accusations were published. Horwitch was preparing to leave for the Baltimore set for production on the third episode, which he had written, when Gibson called him and said, “Don’t get on the plane.” He knew what that meant. On the other side of the country, the showrunners met with Netflix and MRC, the studio that produces the show, to figure out next steps. Spacey was out, but was House of Cards over? “There was an idea to shut everything down for a while just to process everything that had happened and give it its due process,” Pugliese said.  The following day, Gibson and Pugliese gathered the writers to try to motivate them to conceive of a new season, without Frank Underwood — despite the possibility that their work could ultimately be in vain. “We were trying to keep the energy alive,” Gibson said. “We were trying to maintain creative momentum and be ready for any possibility.”  Before they returned to the story, the group spent one day catching up on the news and sharing their feelings. “There was a really strong bond created between all of us, not just from the writers’ room experience, but because of going through this very specific and surprising experience because of Kevin Spacey,” Gu said. Several of the writers mentioned being impressed with how calm and caring their bosses were. “There was no sense of panic,” Hairston said. “There was just a sense of processing it.” Hoffman coped by buying chocolate babkas from different bakeries every day and taste-testing them with her colleagues. “I have this very specific memory of toasting chocolate babkas and buttering them and eating them. Like a lot,” supervising producer-writer Charlotte Stoudt recalled. “We were indulging the sweet tooth, but at least it didn’t get more dire than that,” Hairston added with a laugh.  It didn’t take long for the room to get back to work. “We have no control over the machinations outside of our room,” Hoffman said. “The only thing we can control is the story. There was not much else to do at that point.” Horwitch was allowed to stay in Los Angeles with his family for the month of November; he would call in for four to six hours a day to break stories with his colleagues. “There was a lot of momentum going forward,” Gu said. “We knew what was riding on a new season being re-broken by us. There were 400-plus people that were working on it, the audience expectations, and our desire to get out the message that one man was not going to decide our fate. We wanted to end it as dignified as possible.”  The season of House of Cards written before the Spacey revelations revolved around Claire coercing Frank into giving her a divorce. Frank would retreat into the background as he fought to keep his hold on the Oval Office with the help of two new characters, the Shepherds, sibling corporate Republican power brokers (played by Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane) modeled after the real-life Koch brothers. With their money and influence, the Shepherds controlled Frank Underwood’s White House. But they couldn’t control Claire’s; the season would have pitted Frank against Claire until the bitter end.  Although the winner of that battle had not been determined, many scenarios were being considered. Hoffman was rooting for Claire; Gu says he was hoping for a scenario in which both Underwoods won, and America was left the loser. “That felt right for our times,” he said. “To see the horrors play out in their victory would have been interesting without being too moralistic.”  Gibson and Pugliese said they were allowing the fluid process of production, and even consulting with cast and crew, to help them find their denouement. “There were many discoveries along the way as we were shooting, but it was going to be a mighty battle for the narrative,” Gibson said. “We were in the middle of it,” Pugliese added.  Ultimately, Netflix announced on December 4 that it would move forward with a shortened final season, with 8 episodes instead of the usual 13. The writers were relieved to hear the news, but they also felt anxious about the compressed schedule. Even though they’d been breaking the new version of the season for a month, they now had to quickly write the scripts so that production could restart a month later.  The first question they tackled in the Spacey-less version was how to explain Frank’s absence. The former president had undergone a liver transplant last season, and there had been talk on the show of the dangers of not taking his medicine properly. But an accidental death seemed too convenient, Gibson said. If he just disappeared, well, that would seem silly. The writers quickly decided he had to be killed, but there were many options for how he would die, and even more for who would take his life. After all, everyone hated Frank Underwood.  “Claire snuffing out Frank with a pillow over the face,” Horwitch said. “An act of God, or karma, hit by a train, or an air conditioner falling out of the sky. These were all just flights. We pretty quickly settled on poisoning of some kind. There was something cathartic about imagining his demise, all the blood on his hands. At some point, we went through every living character in the show and considered how and why they might waste Frank. It always came back to Claire and [Doug] Stamper.”  In many ways, he was a better antagonist dead than alive.  Although on the show the public is told that Frank died of an accidental overdose while sleeping next to Claire, she lets viewers know early in the season that he actually died on the floor of his bedroom in the White House, and that she suspects he was murdered. What really happened to Frank isn’t revealed until the final moments of the show, a decision the writers made so that Frank’s death could linger over everyone and everything in the season. “You couldn’t say he died and then let it just sit there,” Stoudt said. “Who killed the FU of it all — who wouldn’t want to play that and to watch that? To have him haunt everyone makes you wonder who’s guilty, who does it benefit?”  By the end of the series, Claire has killed almost every major player that gets in her way, but it turns out she did not murder Frank. In the last minutes of the finale, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Frank’s most loyal servant, confesses to Claire that he poisoned Frank with an overdose of his own medications. Why? To stop him from murdering her in the White House and ruining his legacy. “This is Frankenstein, the creation myth, the monster killing his maker,” Horwitch said.  The producers told Kelly that he was the killer while he was on set filming the penultimate episode. For weeks, the writers had debated whether it would be Claire or Doug; occasionally, producers updated the actors on the conversations. “There had been so much talk, all these huddles, like, What if this happens? What if that happens? But I remember when they told me, it made all the sense in the world,” Kelly said. “Doug would go to any [end] to protect Frank, to protect his legacy and all they had worked for. He was saving him from himself. Hearing it, it was one of those feelings, like it almost gave me butterflies.”  “Certainly if I was Claire, I would have killed him,” Hoffman said, with a laugh. “There were good reasons for both to do it.” But in the end, they felt Doug had the better motive.  One element that didn’t change from the original version of the season was Claire’s revelation that she is pregnant with Frank’s child, having used his sperm for IVF, despite their distance before he died and the fact that she had previously had three abortions. The pregnancy was Gibson’s idea. The writers embraced it immediately, as it served dual purposes for Claire in the new version of the season. Not only did it solve the problem of Frank’s will — without an heir, his entire estate would go to Doug — it also created new, softer optics for a president who was under constant siege in her first 100 days in office.  “It’s typical Claire Underwood,” Gibson said. “It’s tactical. She’s weaponizing motherhood.” But on the flip side, Pugliese added, “I think she gets surprised by how much she’s affected by it.”  Although the season had always been designed to be Claire-centric, now there was an opportunity to delve more wholly into her interior life without the intrusion of her overbearing husband. “The specter of Frank was better than Frank,” Hoffmann said. “He’s haunting the show, which kind of mirrored what was happening in real life.”  “By design and [through his] performance, Francis Underwood took up so much oxygen,” Stoudt added. “Once he resigned, his story was essentially over. In many ways, he was a better antagonist dead than alive.”  Even so, in Frank’s absence, the show needed a new, living antagonist. “We had to come up with a worthy rival for Claire,” Horwitch said. Naturally, Stamper seemed like the best choice here, too. He was the only person who knew the worst of Frank’s and Claire’s dirty secrets, and his blind devotion to Frank’s memory threatened her position.  In the final scene of the series, Doug suggests to Claire that she name her child Frances Underwood. But then he makes the mistake of telling Claire that Frank “made her” and, indirectly, asks her to pardon Frank posthumously. Things quickly go south when Claire rejects the idea and tells him to admit he’s happy Frank is dead. Doug angrily pokes Claire in the neck with a letter opener, accidentally cuts her, and apologizes. But she turns the letter opener on him, stabs him in the abdomen, and covers his nose and mouth as he’s lying in her lap. In the writing process, Gibson and Pugliese envisioned the moment as a pietà. After he takes his last breath, Claire’s last words on the show — “There, no more pain” — echo what Frank said when he put a dog out of its misery in the first season.  “The last scene with Michael felt like the perfect way to end the series; Claire does it out of mercy,” says Wright, who directed the finale. “Claire and Doug have been rivals since the beginning, and it seemed only right that they would face off one last time with only one of them surviving.”  Claire and Doug’s blood in the final moments of the show marks the first time the series made prominent use of the color red. (The show is predominantly filmed in yellows and blues.) “Claire and Doug are two characters that have managed their emotions for many seasons for the sake of whatever their objectives were — for the pursuit of power,” Pugliese said. “Robin and Michael both thought the final scene needed to be more emotional and less verbal than anything we’ve seen before. And the red punctuates the scene and helps us to break from everything we’ve been accustomed to doing on the show up until that moment.”  The scene in the Oval Office was the last one filmed for the series. Everyone on set became emotional as Doug took his final breath. When the assistant director yelled the final “Cut!” after a 14-hour day, Kelly and Wright laughed and hugged. “Nobody wanted to leave,” Pugliese said. “People hung around until daybreak. It’s bittersweet, ‘cause you’re leaving people you’ve worked with intensely for many years. It’s a group of people that collectively got together, put their head[s] down, and worked as hard as possible to finish this series in the best way possible. We got there.”',\n",

The X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37, will lead the star-studded event on Thursday, January 11, at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica, California. “We are absolutely thrilled to have Olivia hosting this year’s ceremony, and know that she will deliver an entertaining and sharp-witted evening to everyone in the room, and the viewers at home,” Broadcast Film Critics Association president Joey Berlin said in a statement. “Beyond her skills as an actress, Olivia’s work as an activist within the industry gives her a powerful voice, making her the perfect candidate to lead this night honoring the best and brightest in film and television.”  As previously reported, Munn was one of six women to allege sexual misconduct against director Brett Ratner in November 2017. The following month, she penned a candid essay for Entertainment Weekly about the “abuse of power” in Hollywood and expressed her staunch support for the “#MeToo” movement.  The news comes one day after the sports gossip blog Terez Owens reported that the Office Christmas Party star’s ex Rodgers, 34, was spotted on a date with Patrick, 35. “Danica and Aaron were all over each other, kissing and couldn’t seem to keep their hands off each other,” an eyewitness claimed to the site, noting that the NFL pro and the NASCAR driver had dinner together after Christmas at his favorite restaurant, Chives, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “This is on the extreme down low, as they both want to keep this quiet for now. It’s early but they are really hitting it off.”  A source also claimed to Us Weekly that the two athletes are dating.  As previously reported, Rodgers and Munn split in April 2017 after three years together. According to an insider, the duo ended their romance due to tension the model had with the quarterback’s family.

Katy Perry, 33, may have kissed a girl, but now she’s allegedly kissing Robert Pattinson, 31, and we think she likes it! Following their romantic dinner date at Taix French Restaurant on Jan. 26, Katy is ready to make things official. “Katy and Rob have been great friends for a long time and they have both considered at different times to become a couple, but timing was never on their sides. They both had their own dating lives to work with, which would never allow them to get together. And now they talk and flirt all the time and Katy would dive into a relationship with Rob in seconds, but she feels she is in Rob’s friend zone. And she is right because Rob is scared to pull the trigger because he doesn’t want to get into a full relationship with the possibility to make things complicated and maybe end up losing a life-long friend if they were to break up,” a source close to Katy tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY!  We totally understand Robert wanting to take things slow. After all, he just got out of a 3-year relationship with FKA Twigs, 30. Robert and FKA were engaged, but decided to call it off due to their busy careers and schedules. Despite this, we think Robert and Katy would make a great couple since there is already so much history! “All it takes is one night, one spark, one moment. Rob knows it is there, Katy knows it is there. They just have to be on the same page and just let it happen. But that is easier said then done. But to say that there is a chance for them to make something more out of their great friendship is more likely to happen then anything else. The year just started and there is always another chance tomorrow,” our source continued.  Katy has also had her fair share of serious relationships. Back in 2010, Katy married British comedian Russell Brand, 42. Their marriage seemed like it would be a forever thing, but they divorced in 2012. Katy has also been romantically linked to John Mayer, 40, Calvin Harris, 34, and recently Orlando Bloom, 41. After one year together, Katy and Orlando went their separate ways, but they’ve remained extremely friendly ever since.

       " 'The Israeli actress, Gal Gadot, who enjoyed a meteoric rise to stardom this year for her performance in the film, “Wonder Women,” has announced that she will star in Tzvi Fishman’s new musical movie, “Queen Esther,” which tells the miracle-filled Purim story of how a woman’s love for her people and her G-d saved the Jewish Nation in ancient Persia – today’s Iran.  “Esther is the real Wonder Woman,” the bright-eyed actress declared. “I am so thankful to the director, Tzvi Fishman, for offering me this opportunity to play the role of Queen Esther – one of my childhood heroines. I am tired of being a seen as a mere beauty queen. A woman is far more than her looks. It’s time for movies to recognize the depth in women, and not just their physical appearance.”  Gadot reports that the film will be shot in Israel, in Hebrew, her native tongue. Film funds in Israel all rejected the project, maintaining it was too religious, and that the script, also written by Fishman, is filled with Rightist ideology.  Mr. Fishman, who is also the film’s producer, says that money for the budget was raised through a “half-shekel” fundraising campaign.  Starring alongside Gal Gadot will be Israel’s popular actor Yehuda Barkan in the role of Achashveros. The wicked Haman will be played by former United States President Barack Obama, his debut role on the silver screen. Fishman himself will play the male lead alongside Gadot, as Esther’s uncle, Mordechai the Jew, who refuses to bow down to Haman. New Zealand’s popular pop-singer, Lorde, is scheduled for the part of Haman’s wife, Vashti.  Fishman, a religious Jew, was asked how he intends to get around the Torah prohibition of hearing the voice of a singing woman in the upcoming movie musical?  “All of the voices of women will be computer generated and dubbed, as if the actresses were doing the singing,” he explained.  “What about the Torah prohibition of gazing at women?”  Fishman has an answer for that as well: “All of the actresses will wear masks, in line with the tradition of wearing costumes on Purim.”  “If the lead actress wears a mask all through the film, why did you choose Gal Gadot for the role?”  “She wears a mask all the time,” the long-bearded writer/director who spent years in Hollywood as a successful screenwriter before becoming religious and making aliya, replied. “Like all the Jews in Hollywood. They are all pretending to be successful, secular, American personalities, just like the Gentiles, when they are really all Israeli Jews in exile. Just like it was with the Jews of Shushan in the Purim story.\"  \"In addition, a Jew can pretend to be secular, but all Jews are believers beneath their costumes and masks. It’s our hope that this film of the Purim story will wake up Jews to recognize their true selves and inspire them to cast off their masquerades and return to Israel and Torah. Happy Purim! Purim Sameach!”  (Note: Tzvi Fishman was awarded the Israel Ministry of Education Prize for Jewish Culture and Creativity. Before making Aliyah to Israel in 1984, he was a successful Hollywood screenwriter. He has co-authored 4 books with Rabbi David Samson, based on the teachings of Rabbis A. Y. Kook and T. Y. Kook. His other books include: \"The Kuzari For Young Readers\" and \"Tuvia in the Promised Land\". His books are available on Amazon. Recently, he directed the movie, \"Stories of Rebbe Nachman.\" )',\n",

       " 'Scheana Shay doesn’t even have to watch Vanderpump Rules to know how her relationship with now ex-boyfriend Rob Valletta has come off to fans.  “I will admit, I haven’t watched the last few episodes … last season, watching my divorce wasn’t as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,” Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.  “Wait, you were?” Madix said sarcastically.  “I kept it super low-key,” Shay joked.  As previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay “pathetic” and “cringeworthy” on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.  “Now I’m single, I’ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,” Shay explained. “Obviously, you can’t see every minute of every conversation … I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one … You can’t fault me for being happy and being in love.”  “Rob was very reserved on the show,” she continued. “He is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person … So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.”  Valletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: “No one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic.

       " 'CLOSE Bibi and Henry, parents of Fiona, a media sensation, live in Hippo Cove at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden while Fiona is cared for in the hippo barn. The Enquirer/Liz Dufour  Henry the hippo rests on top of his daughter, Fiona, in summer 2017 in the hippo cove at Cincinnati Zoo where mom Bibi also lives. (Photo: Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden)  CINCINNATI — The dad of premature hippo Fiona died Tuesday of a lingering infection, almost a year and a half after he arrived from a zoo in Springfield, Mo., Cincinnati Zoo officials said.  Henry, 36, arrived at Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield at 7 months old and spent the next 34 years of his life there — 20 of those years all alone.  He came to Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden in June 2016 a week after Bibi, now 18, arrived from St. Louis Zoo. By the next month, they had been introduced and were breeding.  Baby Fiona, Bibi\\'s firstborn, was supposed to arrive in March but instead was six weeks premature and about 25 pounds lighter than the lowest recorded birth weight for her species. Fiona, born Jan. 24 at 29 pounds, now tips the scales at 550.  ► Oct. 10: Fiona the baby hippo featured in new children\\'s book  ► June 1: Fiona the hippo dazzles in front of the cameras  ► April 29: Baby hippo\\'s keepers learn to live with bruises  Henry, who had sired other hippos in Springfield, wasn\\'t there for Fiona\\'s birth but was introduced to her in July. He, Fiona and Bibi would spend most of their days napping on top of one another like a normal hippo herd.  Then Henry stopped eating and got diarrhea. Henry\\'s caretakers began feeding him antibiotics and pain medication with applesauce and beet pulp. But \"nothing — antibiotics, favorite foods, extra TLC — seemed to turn his condition around,” said Christina Gorsuch, the zoo\\'s curator of mammals.  We’re very sad to announce that our beloved Henry has died. Read more: https://t.co/3cx5vSMzWFpic.twitter.com/dAX2a4YQIa — Cincinnati Zoo (@CincinnatiZoo) October 31, 2017  “The blood work from Henry’s last exam gave us some hope that he was on the mend, but his appetite never returned and his condition declined rapidly,\" she said. \"Vets and his care team worked tirelessly to keep him comfortable and help him fight this illness.\"  In the intervening months he had lost hundreds of pounds from his 3,650-pound frame and could not overcome his infection. Despite having some good days, the bad ones outnumbered them, so caretakers decided to euthanize him Tuesday, according to a zoo statement.  ► March 14: The science behind milking a hippo, saving baby Fiona  ► Feb. 5: Cincinnati Zoo\\'s premature hippo Fiona takes first steps  \"He became pickier and pickier until he was barely eating anything and he began losing weight,\" Henry\\'s caretaker, Wendy Rice, wrote on her blog Monday. \"Additionally, he became more lethargic and less interactive with keeper staff and even his interactions with Bibi and Fiona diminished.\"  When caretakers first noticed his illness, they isolated him from Fiona and Bibi because they were worried that he might be contagious. When tests came back negative for bad bacteria and viruses, zoo staff brought the trio back together.  “From meeting, bonding and breeding with his mate Bibi, to becoming a father to charismatic and spirited Fiona, Henry’s days in Cincinnati were filled with sunshine, watermelons (and) waterfalls.” Wendy Rice, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden  Henry started to get better, but at the end of September began going downhill again, Rice wrote. In mid-October, zoo doctors anesthetized Henry for a full checkup and a transfer of some of Bibi\\'s healthy digestive system bacteria into Henry\\'s stomach.  But Henry\\'s white blood cell count soon after showed he was fighting a serious infection and his kidneys appeared to be shutting down.  \"While our time with him has been short in quantity, no one can deny that his quality of life before becoming ill was exceptional,\" Rice said. The median life expectancy for a male Nile hippopotamus is 35, so Henry was a year older.  \"From meeting, bonding and breeding with his mate Bibi, to becoming a father to charismatic and spirited Fiona, Henry’s days in Cincinnati were filled with sunshine, watermelons, waterfalls and the highest quality of care that can be provided to any animal,\" she said.

       " 'The Big Bang Theory is going out on top. Despite recent remarks by CBS that it was in talks for more seasons of the highly-rated series, the network, producing studio Warner Bros. TV and executive producer Chuck Lorre just announced that the comedy will end its run in May 2019 with its upcoming 12th season. The Big Bang Theory still will rank as the longest-running multi-camera series in television history per WBTV, spanning 12 seasons and a record-breaking 279 episodes, .  “We are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons. We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show’s success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close,” WBTV, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions said in a joint statement.  CBS  The announcement about The Big Bang Theory coming to an end comes just two weeks after CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at TCA that “we don’t believe it’s the final season; we are in preliminary discussions to renew the show with the studio that produces it, Warner Bros.”  I hear conversations about a possible two-year renewal were going on as recently as late last week.  Eleven seasons in, The Big Bang Theory remains one of the biggest shows on television. Season 11 averaged 18.9 million viewers, even with Season 10. It was the second most watched series of last season, edging Sunday Night Football and only behind the now-canceled Roseanne. Among adults 18-49, Big Bang slipped a bit (4.4 in Live+7 vs. 4.9 last season) but still ranked as the second highest-rated entertainment program behind only NBC’s This Is Us.  According to sources, the decision to end the series was largely a creative one made by the producers. It was perceived that Season 12 would be the show’s last when CBS in 2017 renewed Big Bang for seasons 11 and 12 after WBTV had closed new two-year deals with the cast. But then few expected that Big Bang would remain as strong in the ratings as it’s been, maintaining its viewership and top standing in the rankings when most broadcasting series have been sliding.  To go beyond 12 seasons, Warner Bros. TV would’ve had to negotiate new contracts with the actors. The show’s original quintet are the highest-paid actors on TV with paychecks of around $1 million an episode.  REX/Shutterstock  There are no deals in place for next season between CBS and WBTV, between the studio and the cast as well as between the studio and the series’ creative staff. While this was not a business call as CBS and WBTV would’ve likely reached an agreement for more seasons, I hear that, with so many unknowns and not clear whether everyone wanted to come back, the producers had no desire to continue with the show creatively without the entire family on the show intact.  That and the lure of leaving on top, as the highest-rated comedy on television, having achieved the milestone of longest-running multi-camera sitcom, sealed the decision to end the series.  The final season of The Big Bang Theory will debut Monday, September 24 on CBS before moving to its regular time period on Thursday, September 27.  “The Big Bang Theory has been the defining comedy of its generation,” Kahl said today. “All of us at the Network take exceptional pride in this series that uniquely combines creative genius, commercial ratings success, cultural influence and characters who became so popular, they are easily known by just one name. We’re incredibly grateful for our partnership with Warner Bros., Chuck Lorre Productions and a brilliant cast and crew that has made such a ‘big bang’ and lasting legacy on the television landscape.”  The Big Bang Theory, which debuted in 2007 and airs in syndication around the world, has received 52 Emmy nominations and 10 wins to date (though has never won for Outstanding Comedy Series), and 7 Golden Globe nominations.  Since its off-network launch, Big Bang has been a syndication powerhouse and continues to deliver big ratings for TBS and the stations that carry it, with its success possibly marking an end of an era and may never be matched again.  The Big Bang Theory is executive produced by Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady, Steven Molaro and Steve Holland. The series stars Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch. The Big Bang Theory is produced by Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc., in association with Warner Bros. Television.  In 2015, the first-ever UCLA scholarship created by and named for a television series, The Big Bang Theory Scholarship supports undergraduate students in need of financial aid who are pursuing their higher education in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  And some fun facts: In addition to centering many of its episodes in the worlds of science and technology, The Big Bang Theory enjoys a healthy appreciation and support from the scientific community at large, including having a bee species (Euglossa bazinga), a jellyfish species (Bazinga Rieki) and a monkey at the Columbus Zoo (Dr. Sheldon Cooper) named in the show’s honor.',\n",

Matt Swider The Cyber Monday dates change every year (since it's always a Monday, but it's always the Monday after Thanksgiving (the last Thursday of November) and the Monday after Black Friday. So despite the date changing, the routine is always the same. That means Cyber Monday 2018 is November 26, and the many (if not all) deals will expire as Tuesday rolls around. Usually this means Cyber Monday will end at midnight Pacific time (Amazon, for example, is based on the West coast of the US). In that time, we're going to see. We're going to see 4K TVs on sale from Samsung, LG, Sony, and especially TCL, with the Roku Fire TV combo impressing. Cameras will be on sale from Canon and Nikon, but the most popular camera deals will come from GoPro. Note the new GoPro Hero 7 Black hasn't had get a steep discount, but the older GoPro Hero 6 Black and GoPro Hero 5 Black will still see significant price drops. Top US retailers with the best Cyber Monday 2018 are expected to be Walmart , Amazon , Newegg , Best Buy, GameStop, and Jet.  4K TV deals will satill be big on Cyber Monday  Matt Swider When it comes to video game consoles, Nintendo Switch may get its second year of big deals (it was massively popular last year – and actually in stock), and PS4 and Xbox One will continue to be big sellers on Cyber Monday. Overall, the best value comes from games bundled with the system rather than reduced prices. The best noise-canceling headphones, wireless headphone, and Bluetooth speakers are gadgets that just about everyone on your holiday wish list will want in 2018. The same goes for even bigger ticket items: the best iPads, Chromebooks, and fitness trackers, and DSLRs.  What’s the difference between Black Friday and Cyber Monday?  Matt Swider The Black Friday vs Cyber Monday debate is an important one. You don't want to buy something for Black Friday only to have it become cheaper on Cyber Monday. Or do you? Our best advice is to buy everything you need on Black Friday and keep a watch on additional price drops on Cyber Monday. If it's all cheaper on Cyber Monday, return your Black Friday item (or cancel it if that option is still available) and walk away with the cheapest price possible. But, in advance, Black Friday usually offers steep discounts in stores, while Cyber Monday is almost strictly an online sale. Retailers, like Walmart and Amazon are very keen to keep you shopping all weekend long, so they often slowly roll out deals (with 'rollback prices' in Walmart's case) to keep you browsing throughout the Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates.  Cyber Monday can help you save on the most expensive products, like gaming computers  The top deals of Cyber Monday last year  Matt Swider Listing the best Cyber Monday deals last year started off with cheap iPads. iPad Pro is wildly expensive for the average consumer. But on that special Monday date last year, you could get up to $120 off the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad. Sonos speakers and the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 were also big sellers thanks to price cuts. Yes, HomePod had just launched and MacBooks do remain very popular, but Sonos and Microsoft have offered better prices (and better value). That was true last year and may remain true in 2018.  Why is Cyber Monday called Cyber Monday?  Matt Swider The term was coined by Ellen Davis and Scott Silverman, and it was a deliberate move to promote online shopping back in 2005, when the internet was made of wood and powered by steam. It was intended to help smaller retailers compete with the big names who were banging on about Black Friday, although of course those big names promptly jumped on the Cyber Monday bandwagon too.  Are Cyber Monday deals real?  Matt Swider Oooh, the big question: generally speaking, yes they are – although in some cases the discounts have been negotiated well in advance with suppliers, so they’re not as spontaneous as the sellers might have you believe. As with any sales event, you’ll see a mixture of genuine bargains, discounted end-of-line stock and strange things found in the back of a warehouse somewhere. In 2016, consumer magazine 'Which?' accused retailers of some pretty dodgy behavior. If you avoid the slightly-shifty stuff, though, you can get some really great deals. For example, last year we got tons of money off 5K iMacs (end of line stock), Hi-Res audio players (deep discounting in the hope of selling headphones), wireless headphones (from another retailer hoping to sell Hi-Res audio players) and tons of Christmas presents. And, some TechRadar writers were physically restrained from spending all our savings on electric guitars, which were getting some serious discounting on high-end models.  How is TechRadar showing the best Cyber Monday deals?  Matt Swider A lot of research goes into finding the best Cyber Monday deals. For 2018, we've gone through over 10,000 deals from various US retailers: Walmart, Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Target. And with so many models of laptops, 4KTVs, and other electronics. We do this months in advance, predicting which Cyber Monday categories (like smart speakers) will take off, and then reporting on the results in the day after Cyber Monday.

       " \"But sources say there’s another huge reason for her wanting to lie low – problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.  It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.  ‘She’s under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,’ adds the source.  ‘Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she’s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she’s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‘Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they’re just friends and that he’s committed but Jen just isn’t buying it.  ‘She’s very wary of him – after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‘While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she’s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that’s how everything worked out,’ reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‘She had been sad it never happened,’ a source told the magazine. ‘But it never consumed her.’  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‘This could be a dream come true for her, and she’s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that’s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.’  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‘This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don’t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,’ she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‘No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.’  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!\",\n",

At her new L.A. mansion, Jolie reveals the tension between the two Angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal.  There’s the Angelina Jolie who’s now a single mother—managing the day-to-day chaos of six kids, and the trauma of her split from Brad Pitt—and there’s the Angelina Jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking Netflix original about Cambodia’s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her. At her new L.A. mansion, Jolie reveals the tension between the two Angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal.  Like most things involving Angelina Jolie, stepping foot into her house is an experience so heightened one wonders if it’s for real or the product of careful orchestration. The large gates to her recently purchased Los Feliz house—an 11,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts mansion once owned by the epic filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille—slowly swing open, revealing rolling lawns, lush trees at the perimeter. No one’s there, and all is quiet except for the delicate sound of fountains, arched in a row over a swimming pool. A number of doors to the house are open, as if posing some riddle from a fairy tale—which one to enter? Inside, the vibe is airy and calm: all open windows and cross-breezes, creamy-white unlit candles, soft creamy-white furnishings. Finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamy-white, floor-length caftan. Her hair is down, her feet bare, only a touch of makeup, her skin luminous. She smiles widely—a beneficent, ethereal wood nymph. But as soon as she starts speaking, you realize that your preconceived notions about Jolie aren’t quite right. She’s not a celestial goddess. She’s not the high-and-mighty do-gooder. She’s not the intense control freak—or at least not obviously so. She comes across, rather, as normal-person friendly and practical, even chitchatty. She explains the deal with the big empty mansion. She moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids. It wasn’t for the prestigious history or the architecture. She needed a good place fast, somewhere secluded, with a lot of rooms; this one, which was listed for around $25 million, has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. Following her September 2016 filing for divorce from Brad Pitt, she and her children spent nine months in a rental, basically living out of suitcases. And so she hasn’t really unpacked, barely knows her way around the place, has never had a real visitor, and isn’t sure where the best spot is to sit and talk. With that in question, she roams from room to room—the fabulous kitchen, worthy of a Nancy Meyers movie, charming gray library with a library ladder (her favorite room in the house), the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase, anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers. She finally settles on the living room, which a set-decorator friend furnished on the fly, with two creamy-white sofas and some big throw pillows. She looks at them curiously. “I didn’t even know I needed ‘throw pillows.’ ” Decorating, house stuff, “that was always Brad’s thing.” On cue, as if taunting her, Jolie’s large Rottweiler, Dusty, soaking from a trip to the pool, jumps onto the sofa, soiling it. She sighs, amused, half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand, then gives up and sits somewhere else. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Life in her household is apparently like this—messy, relaxed, normal. The kids are polite but not phony polite. Zahara, 12, whom Jolie describes as “the rock” of the family, comes downstairs. “Zaz!” Jolie cries, midsentence. They discuss the whereabouts of everyone else. Zahara hugs the wet dog. Jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim Dusty just took. We move to the kitchen, where Jolie fixes herself a cup of tea. Vivienne, 9, comes in with a friend, having just been at a sleepover. She’s wearing a jean backpack covered with pins. Jolie envelops her in her arms. I ask the girl if she’s called “Viv” or “Vivienne.” “Either one!” she says with a smile. She dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend. Jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket, shredded to death, and explains, laughing, “She has 32 blankets. She is very into her blanket, and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket. She actually said to me the other day, ‘Mom, I can taste my blanket.’ ‘That, honey, is a sign that it really, really needs to be washed.’ ” Jolie tidies up Vivienne’s things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter. We step outside and there’s Shiloh, 11, and Knox, 9, hanging out. Shiloh, who likes to dress like a boy, is wearing a camouflage jacket, long shorts, and heavy black sneakers, despite the blazing heat. Knox immediately wants to know when Jolie’s going to put up the waterslide. “How about a ‘Hello, Mom’?” she says, with a hug, sounding like just about every other loving, exasperated mother in America. So far, there’s only one piece of personal artwork up—a black-and-white photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children, smiling and holding their various pets—dogs, reptiles, and rodents.  Jolie and Pitt, who’d been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in Hollywood, split last September. She filed for divorce suddenly “for the health of the family,” according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara), three of whom are biological (Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox). Things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between Pitt and Maddox. When they touched down, Jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. This was no “Conscious Uncoupling.” An anonymous phone call was made to authorities. The F.B.I. and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services began investigating Pitt for child abuse. He was soon cleared and later said in an interview with GQ Style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem. There were rumors he was having an affair with Marion Cotillard (denied by both Pitt and Cotillard). Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce. As for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams—with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women’s rights at the London School of Economics—just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she’s now doing it alone. There’s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day—playdates, doctors’ appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there’s the deeper, emotional chaos. “It’s just been the hardest time, and we’re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we’re all trying to do our best to heal our family.” As it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung’s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung’s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country’s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who’ve seen it, it’s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country’s history, a history that’s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it’s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it’s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.  Recall, if you can, the Angelina of the late 90s, the era of Angie Peak Crazy. Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other’s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being “so in love . . . right now” with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life—her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood’s newest “It girl” landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood’s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-’em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who’d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, “I found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,” recalls Jolie. “You drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.” Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. She suddenly became curious about the world—starting with the country she was in. One day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $2: Ung’s memoir. It was among the factors that inspired Jolie to find a greater purpose. In 2001, equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the United Nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the High Commissioner for Refugees. On one of her first U.N. missions, in 2002, she returned to Cambodia to meet up with NGO workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. Among them was Ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to America since the war but had spent her adult years working on Cambodia’s troubles. She had never seen an Angelina Jolie movie, but Jolie certainly didn’t seem like anyone’s vision of a movie star. “She was just a really cool human being,” recalls Ung. “And she didn’t mind getting dirty.” On her relationship with Brad Pitt: “We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” She and Jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of Cambodia where Ung hadn’t been since the war. Thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie—but it wasn’t. They met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. Soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. Before going to sleep, Jolie realized she already trusted Ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she’d been thinking about—adopting a Cambodian orphan. “I asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,” recalls Jolie. Ung was wholeheartedly supportive. “Angie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me,” says Ung. “I was orphaned when I was eight years old, and so I think, when you’ve gone through experiences like that, there’s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.” Jolie says that Ung’s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. Had she responded differently, explains Jolie, “it might have changed my decision. It might have made it very hard for me.” Ung has been in Jolie’s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. Jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. A couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of Battambang, having promised herself that she’d go only to one, that she wasn’t going to shop around. But Jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. “I didn’t feel a connection with any of them,” she recalls. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. “They then said, ‘There’s one more baby.’ ” Baby Maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. She looked at him. He looked at her. “I cried and cried,” she recalls.  And thus began a 15-year project, in which Jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. She bought a house in Cambodia and became a citizen. In 2003, she started what became the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, focusing on Cambodia’s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. She intensified her U.N. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti. (She’s now been on more than 60 missions.) She split from Thornton, who didn’t understand her newfound passion. She adopted her second child, Zahara, from Ethiopia. In 2004 she met Pitt, on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. For Jolie, dating Pitt—Hollywood’s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy—catapulted her to another level of fame. Though she has maintained that they didn’t become romantically involved until he and Aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of W, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. Aniston was devastated. For Pitt, dating Jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. It marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life—in Africa, Haiti, and New Orleans—and he formally adopted Maddox and Zahara. He persuaded Jolie to have biological children. She gave birth to Shiloh in 2006, in Namibia, then the twins, Vivienne and Knox, in 2008. In between they adopted Pax, then three, from Vietnam. They bought more homes—in France, Spain, New York, and New Orleans. While Pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (Moonlight, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave), Jolie took a new chance with directing—with In the Land of Blood and Honey, about Bosnia, a project inspired by some of the U.N. work she’d done there. Together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. Nothing seemed beyond their abilities. They traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. They tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to. They had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. But Jolie’s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one’s “small part in the bigger picture.” For a time, it all worked beautifully. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.  It was 2012, and Jolie had recently finished In the Land of Blood and Honey. She wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and Ung’s story had at this point been with her for a decade. By the time they had a completed draft, the chance for Jolie to direct Unbroken, based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. After that, Maddox, who knew “Auntie” Loung’s story, brought it up. “He was the one who said, ‘It’s time to do it,’ ” says Jolie. She knew that Maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he’d be “standing there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.” Jolie and Ung dived back in. Credited on the film as an executive producer, Maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. Jolie took it to Netflix, where chief creative officer Ted Sarandos signed on without hesitation. “In the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,” recalls Sarandos. “The film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . That’s what hooked me more than anything.” Despite Jolie’s Cambodian ties, she felt she needed a Cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. So she reached out to Rithy Panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in Cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the Khmer Rouge in several documentaries, including The Missing Picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film Academy Award in 2014. She and Panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if Cambodia wanted it to be—not a foregone conclusion, given that Cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (The Killing Fields, Roland Joffé’s 1984 film about the Khmer Rouge, had to be filmed in Thailand and elsewhere.) The war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. Still, Jolie was trepidatious and approached the country’s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just Ung’s story but also the story of a people. Jolie’s Cambodian track record made the difference, says Ung. “In a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated—respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. Angie walks in Cambodia with this respect.” Cambodia went all in—closing off Battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the Khmer Rouge army. “It’s not a poetic thing to say—[this film] was made by the country,” says Jolie. Between cast and crew, some 3,500 Cambodians participated.  To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. “Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,” Jolie says. “When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.” Jolie then tears up. “When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn’t have enough money for a nice funeral.” That authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says Jolie, making for a film set like nothing she’d ever seen. “There wasn’t a person who was working on the movie who didn’t have a personal connection. They weren’t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . It completed something for them.” Some had flashbacks and nightmares. For this reason, a therapist was on set every day. And then there were the odd bystanders who hadn’t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. In one scene, recalls Jolie, “when the Khmer Rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. They were horrified to see them come back.” Given the size and complexity of the production, a different Hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. According to Ung and Panh, Jolie knows Cambodia so well she’s internalized the country’s character traits. At lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls Panh, and she never raised her voice. “Here we don’t shout. We talk,” he says. In Cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful—it’s also considered a sign of weakness. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Many eyes were on Maddox, who is as famous in Cambodia as Jolie. “It was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,” says Jolie, who wasn’t sure how he’d ultimately react to the experience. Would he connect? Would he want to flee? Jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard Maddox say, “Can I go sleep in my house with my friends?,” referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002. “I hadn’t heard him refer to it that way. You can’t push it. You can’t say, ‘Isn’t this great?’ You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.” She considers the endeavor to connect Maddox to his homeland—as she does Zahara to Ethiopia and Pax to Vietnam—a family effort, not a solo one. With that in mind, while Pitt was in the Middle East working on War Machine, the other five kids also went to Cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother’s movie. Pax did still photography. The other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. In February, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of Angkor Wat. According to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. What moved Jolie perhaps more than anything was that “the Cambodian people had a big movie premiere. They saw a movie for which they made the sets. [It was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.”  Alas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with Pitt was suffering. By the time First They Killed My Father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, “things got bad,” says Jolie. “I didn’t want to use that word. . . . Things became ‘difficult.’ ” There has been Hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on Pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. When I bring this question up to her, it’s the one moment when Jolie becomes a bit defensive. “[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,” she says quickly, adamantly. “That was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.” Jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn’t want to talk about the breakup. And yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. “They’ve been very brave. They were very brave.” Brave when? “In times they needed to be.” Other statements are similarly cryptic. “We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.” I mention Pitt’s mea culpa in GQ Style. Did it surprise her? “No,” she replies, looking unmoved. I refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that’s true. There’s a long pause. She looks down, formulates an answer. “We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.” There’s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. But she’s trying to keep the emotions at bay. “I was very worried about my mother, growing up—a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it’s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything’s going to be all right even when you’re not sure it is.” Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother’s life when she was just 56, as well as those of other family members. In a 2013 New York Times op-ed column, Jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the BRCA1 gene. Two years later, while working in the editing room on By the Sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. “Ten minutes later, the room’s spinning, and you just think, How . . . ?” She kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. When she finally learned she didn’t have cancer, “I dropped to my knees.” She made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. “I went into the actual surgery happy as they come. I was skipping. Because at that point it was just preventative.” She instantly went into menopause. Last year, in addition to hypertension, Jolie developed Bell’s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. “Sometimes women in families put themselves last,” she says, “until it manifests itself in their own health.” Jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. Lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. She quips, “I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had.” The idea that she could still be anyone’s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. But she says, “I actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I’m being smart about my choices, and I’m putting my family first, and I’m in charge of my life and my health. I think that’s what makes a woman complete.” Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.  Apart from promoting First They Killed My Father, on Netflix this month, Jolie has no interest in working on another film at this particular moment—her life just doesn’t have the space for it. Right now, “I’m just wanting to make the proper breakfast and keep the house. That’s my passion. At the request of my kids, I’m taking cooking classes. As I go to sleep at night, I think, Did I do a great job as a mom or was that an average day?” (But it is rumored she is negotiating to star in Bill Condon’s remake of the 1935 film The Bride of Frankenstein.) She’s reconnected with her father, from whom she’d been estranged. “He’s been very good at understanding they needed their grandfather at this time. I had to do a therapy meeting last night and he was just around. He knows kind of the rule—don’t make them play with you. Just be a cool grandpa who’s creative, and hang out and tell stories and read a book in the library.” Her main source of comfort has been Ung. “She’s that girlfriend who rolled up her sleeves, got on a plane, and helped me on Christmas morning,” says Jolie. “She’s been my closest friend. I cried on her shoulder.”',\n",
       " \"Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker – a married man – and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn’t going to quietly put up with Shelton’s attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert’s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was – a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert’s embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  “Blake is reveling in Miranda’s humiliation now that she’s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,” claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the “once a cheater always a cheater” theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her “twisted relationship antics.”  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert “played the victim,” he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman’s husband, then it is “sweet justice.”  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ — TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a “hypocrite.”  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn’t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker’s marriage. So, she won’t be sitting around and taking Shelton’s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn’t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be “trading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.”\",\n",
       " 'If any of us brought a guy like Liam Hemsworth home, our parents would be planning a wedding within minutes (or at least, my parents would be). Which is exactly why we are so shocked by what Tish Cyrus has to say about him. Miley Cyrus’s mom doesn’t get the pressure to marry Liam Hemsworth.  Say what?!!  While the rest of the world drools over Miley and Liam’s beautiful relationship, Tish just doesn’t see the big deal. Guess visiting children’s hospitals together and raising a bunch of animals doesn’t warm her heart like it does for us! Regardless of what the rest of the world wants, Tish thinks Miley has plenty of time before she even has to start thinking of marriage.  But don’t get her wrong. Tish totally supports her daughter’s relationship.  She even gave us their relationship update!  Tish Cyrus spoke with Mario Lopez on his radio show on Wednesday, and revealed that Miley and Liam are stronger than ever. But, wedding bells are not in their immediate future.  \"She is not eloping. She is not getting married. They are so freaking happy and living in Malibu,\"  Honestly, what else would we want for the power couple that is giving us ultimate #RelationshipGoals?  It seems like Miley and Tish are in agreement about not rushing into a legal binding marriage.  “She’s so happy, and she’s always like, ‘I don’t know why everybody wants us to get married. It’s so perfect.\\'” You know what they say — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  Regardless — we’re sure shippers will still freak out whenever they see Miley wearing white. Like that one time Miley’s dad Billy Ray Cyrus posted a photo of his daughter wearing white with the caption, “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus.” Everyone was convinced Billy Ray just witnessed his daughter get married, but that was soo not the case.  Miley’s dad later had to clarify that Miley was NOT getting married, and that he simply was just stating that he’s happy for her. Because, ya know, women can look happy in white dresses without having to get married. Miley is probably enjoying her successful career as a musician — and as she should, girl hustles and works hard.  As long as Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are happy together, how “official” their relationship is shouldn’t matter. We’re just glad to see those two kids back in each other’s lives.',\n",
       " 'The ABC reality star and fiancee Lauren Burnham plan to marry in January — but ABC viewers aren\\'t invited.  One day after his ex-fiancee announced that she is now engaged, former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. revealed that he and Lauren Burnham have set a wedding date.  \"We\\'re getting married in Hawaii on Jan. 12 next year,\" Burnham, with Luyendyk by her side, announced on The View Wednesday. \"If we were able to get married tomorrow, we would. We\\'re just ready for that next step.\"  The pair — who just bought a new house in Scottsdale, Ariz., where Luyendyk, a race car driver and real estate broker, is based — have booked Maui\\'s Haiku Mill for the nontelevised event. \"It\\'s a private wedding, so not on TV,\" he confirmed. \"Just a close group of friends, probably 100 guests.\"  As ABC\\'s most-recent Bachelor, Luyendyk became one of the most controversial stars of the long-running franchise when he swapped his final pick. After he proposed to an accepting Becca Kufrin on the pretaped March 5 episode, it was revealed on the post-finale After the Final Rose special that Luyendyk had changed his mind.  After a two-month engagement, Luyendyk called off his relationship with Kufrin during a difficult-to-watch on-camera breakup that played out unedited and ran for nearly an hour. He then turned around and proposed a second time on live television to Burnham, who accepted.  \"Going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn\\'t a popular decision,\" Luyendyk explained, \"but it was a decision I had to make for myself. At the end of the day, it\\'s a TV show but this is the rest of our lives, and Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with.\"  The choices made by Luyendyk and producers to ambush Kufrin, and by ABC to air the breakup footage, sent backlash Luyendyk\\'s way and turned off some fans of the franchise. Think pieces and takedowns ran in the week that followed and as Kufrin accepted her new role as the next star of The Bachelorette, Luyendyk and Burnham largely disappeared from the spotlight, choosing to keep viewers updated on their relationship via their social media channels.  On Wednesday, the pair said neither of them has watched the finale to this day.  \"They say it was unedited but it was edited,\" said Luyendyk. \"[As the Bachelor,] you are not in the editing room and you can\\'t really control what they show.\"  He added, \"Going into it, the biggest reason why I wanted it to be filmed was so that everyone could see the story. Not only the good things but also the bad things. Just because [with] the finale, there\\'s always a lot of questions. When [former Bachelor] Jason Mesnick changed his mind — he\\'s happy and has kids and a great life — they didn\\'t film anything and fans were upset by that. I really wanted everyone to see our love story and I think the editing chose to show more of the breakup than the happy parts of that ending.\"  Burnham admitted that she knew Luyendyk was going to break up with Kufrin, but that filming the heartbreaks are part of what they signed up for.  \"I knew he was going to break up with Becca and I knew that production was involved, so I kind of figured that\\'s what was happening,\" she said. \"But the whole thing was taped. My breakup was taped and everyone else\\'s was, that\\'s kind of the name of the game.\"  Unlike a handful of successful Bachelor couples to come before them, Luyendyk and Burnham are opting to not invite ABC\\'s cameras to their big day. The Bachelor franchise has aired five TV weddings, including original Bachelorette Trista and Ryan Sutter\\'s and former Bachelor Sean and Catherine Lowe\\'s.  When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter after the finale in March, the couple had said they hoped to set a date later in the year. At the time, they both said they were open to the idea of a TV wedding, but Luyendyk had added, \"I think it’s more about if it works in our timeline.\"  Luyendyk\\'s and Burnham\\'s live TV appearance — their first since a whirlwind post-finale press week — comes days before Kufrin begins her Bachelorette journey Monday.  When asked about the curious timing, Burnham replied with a laugh, \"Honestly, I don\\'t think we really had much control over that.\" Luyendyk added, \"Our plan just came together so it just happens to be the timing of things. We\\'re excited to do it privately because everyone asks us, so we were like: Why not just come on here and tell everybody?\"  Though Burnham played coy about whether or not she has spoken to Kufrin or if they will appear on the upcoming season, Luyendyk had a solid answer when asked if he would do anything differently: \"It\\'s hard to live in regret. Because of how things ended, I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn\\'t change it.\"  Viewers have been particularly invested in Kufrin\\'s happily ever after ever since she was subjected to the on-camera breakup, and on Tuesday, she revealed that she does in fact find love at the end of her journey, which wrapped filming weeks ago.  \"I\\'m engaged!\" she told People. \"I still pinch myself, like, did that all just happen? It’s been a whirlwind.\"  Adding, \"It feels so good to say it and this time, I think it\\'s going to stick!\"  She also said that now, having been in Luyendyk\\'s shoes as the lead of the reality dating show, she does sympathize with his decision-making.  \"Looking back, as weird as it sounds, I can really only thank [Arie] because he followed his heart and it allowed me to go on this new journey for myself to find the person who is a better suit, better fit for me,\" she said. \"He\\'s just a special one.\"  Twenty-eight men compete for Kufrin\\'s final rose when The Bachelorette premieres Monday, May 28, at 8 p.m. on ABC.',\n",
       " 'She had been running as a Republican in California\\'s 44th District.  Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California\\'s 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  \"There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,\" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to \"be masculine\" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a \"tyranny by the minority.\"  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the \"new director\" of the Academy\\'s \"minority outreach program.\"  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her \"goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.\"  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state\\'s 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California\\'s 43rd District.  \"After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,\" Dash said in her statement. \"I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.\"  She added that she knows her \"political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.\"',\n",

According to The Sun, the 20-year-old pop star left his American bulldog pup with a dog trainer back in February... and hasn\\'t been back for her since.  Speaking to the paper, trainer Trevor Dvernichuk revealed he had been left with the pooch for months.  Scroll down for video  Is that good Karma? Justin Bieber is said to have left behind his American bulldog puppy Karma with a dog trainer in Canada... and hasn\\'t picked her up since February  \\'This is like taking your kid to school and not picking it back up,\\' he said.  Bieber\\'s father Jeremy had originally asked Dvernichuk, of Ontario, Canada, to look after Karma for a few weeks and get her trained before taking her to America.  However, the singer has failed to return to get the dog and is said to have not responded to calls to take her back.  He also claimed that the singer has not paid for Karma\\'s upkeep.  Adorable: Karma the puppy - who was named by one of his fans - came into Bieber\\'s life last Christmas  In September, the dog trainer took to his Facebook page, writing: \\'Karma is gonna bite you in your ass biebers.\\'  He posted his comment along with a YouTube video news report about the singer getting his dog back in December 2013.  He later added on his Facebook page: \\'More pictures of Karma\\' up to date pictures...the best behaved American bulldog i\\'ve ever had the honor to train...but its time for her to go.\\'  The Baby hitmaker first got his puppy back at the end of last year for Christmas, picking her up from Ruffin\\'s Pet Centre in Stratford, Ontario.  His dad then asked Bieber\\'s army of fans to come up with a name for her, and they soon settled on Karma.  At the time, Bieber Senior wrote on Twitter: \\'So we\\'re gonna let one lucky #belieber name @justinbieber\\'s new puppy.... Follow and find out how it can be you).\\'  BFFs: Bieber and Mally appeared to be best pals for a while, but Justin soon grew tired of the monkey  He later updated his page with the winner, writing: \\'so we have got a name selected for the newest Bieber.

Sadly the teenage super-fan didn\\'t turn out to be a very good surrogate parent to Pac, and he went to \\'little hamster heaven,\\' in March 2013.  In June last year, Bieber\\'s Capuchin monkey was seized by German customs officials after the singer brought it on tour to Munich with him without the right vaccination and import paperwork.  He had the opportunity to retrieve 20-month old Mally, but failed to collect him on time and missed a deadline to send the documents, according to customs spokesman Thomas Meister.  Ownership of the animal was then transferred to Germany and he was taken first to a Munich animal shelter and now lives in Serengeti Park near Hanover, which later billed Biebs $8,000 to cover vaccinations, accommodation and transport.  The Munich shelter has previously criticised Bieber for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying it shouldn\\'t have been taken away from its mother until it was a year old. Experts say Capuchins also need to be kept in groups, not alone.  A representative for Justin Bieber declined to comment on the matter after being approached.',\n",
       " 'Oprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Georgia, Nov. 1. (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)  Contributing opinion writer  A political mentor had a saying when he looked at a good political commercial: “There’s votes in that spot.” That phrase came back to me yesterday when I saw Oprah Winfrey say, “This land was made for you and me.” The phrase makes a powerful rallying cry for a lot of Democrats in 2018 and beyond, and the reigning queen of all media rolled out this line while stumping for Stacey Abrams in the race for governor in Georgia.  While Winfrey has denied interest in running for office herself, the rumor that she will lingers. The rumor itself isn’t all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.  The Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans’ reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney’s Bob Iger.  Trump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he’s had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn’t been as kind, calling her “insecure” and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her “weakness.”  But Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.  It may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, “Make America Great Again: The Sequel” against “This land was made for you and me” would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.  Read more:  Carter Eskew: Are there any thoroughbreds in the Democratic presidential field?  Carter Eskew: A better closing argument for Democrats',\n",
       " \"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Chuck stars Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski are reuniting for an episode of the Disney Channel's Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series is a spinoff of the 2010 animated film, Tangled, starring Levi and Mandy Moore.  Action comedy series Chuck aired on NBC from 2007 to 2012. The series starred Levi as Chuck Bartowski, a nerd who has all of the government's secrets downloaded into his brain. Assigned to protect Chuck is the beautiful but deadly CIA agent Sarah Walker (Strahovksi). Chuck and Sarah have to work together to foil terrorist plots, defeat enemy spies, and diffuse bombs. Though the two adopt a fake relationship as part of their cover, the pair eventually become a couple in season 3 and marry in the season 4 finale. Due to low ratings, the show faced threats of cancellation with each season, but with the help of a devoted fan base, the series was able to last for five seasons.  As reported by E! Online, The two leads of Chuck will reunite on TV for the first time in six years for the season 2 premiere of Disney's animated series, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series features Levi in the lead role of Eugene/Flynn Rider, the character he voiced in the Tangled movie. Strahovski will guest star in the season 2 premiere as Eugene's ex-fiancée, Stalyan. Like their Chuck characters, Eugene and Stalyan have a deep romantic history and were once a great team. In a clip for E! Online, Levi and Strahovksi discuss their characters and talk about working together again - see the clip on E! Online's site.  Disney's computer-animated musical adventure film, Tangled was a love story between Levi's character, Flynn Rider, and Moore's Rapunzel. Nominated for several awards, Tangled was considered a critical and commercial success. In 2017, the story was brought back in the form of a TV movie on the Disney Channel, Tangled Ever After, which evolved into Tangled: The Series, with the two lead roles reprised by Levi and Moore. After its first season, the show was retitled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure.  Even though Chuck's series finale was able to wrap up loose ends and give the characters a proper send-off, Levi has been working on reviving the series as a film. Whether this happens or not, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure will finally reunite Levi and Strahovksi, which could be fun for fans of Chuck.  Season 2 of Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure premieres Sunday at 7:45 PM ET on the Disney Channel.  Source: E! Online  NOS4A2 First Look Photo: Zachary Quinto Is A Soul-Sucking Monster\",\n",

In an interview with Rolling Stone about her title role in the blockbuster \\'Wonder Woman\\', the 32-year-old actress shared how she responded to body shamers who said she wasn\\'t curvy enough to play the iconic heroine.  When her body was criticised, the actress said, \"Listen, if you want to be for real, then the Amazons, they had only one boob. Exactly one boob,\" said the former Miss Israel, alluding to a theory in Greek mythology.  Continuing, \"So what are you talking about here? Me having small boobs and small ass? That will make all the difference.\"  Gadot also revealed that she and Jenkins wanted Wonder Woman to be strong but feminine.  \"I didn\\'t want to play the cold-hearted warrior. We didn\\'t want to fall into the cliche´s,\" noted Gadot.  She also shared that she gets really surprised when people come and ask her \"Are you a feminist?\"  Gadot shared, \"People always ask me, \\'Are you a feminist?\\' And I find the question surprising, because I think, \\'Yes, of course. Every woman, every man, everyone should be a feminist. Because whoever is not a feminist is a sexist. Me and my younger sister were taught to value ourselves.\"  Adding, \"I had a very sheltered kind of life. There was no TV-watching.

       " 'Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving on with their lives a year after filing.  The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn’t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.  Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.  “They’re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,” a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. “They continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.”  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck. Pascal Le Segretain/Getty; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic  The day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. “They made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,” a source told PEOPLE. “They spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.”  During the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. “Jen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn’t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,” added the source.  “The kids love when they all spend time together,” said a second source.  When filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. “He’s found a really good routine,” an insider said. “He’s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.”  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus. Gal/BACKGRID  Days before Garner and the children arrived in Hawaii, Affleck’s girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, also visited him.  Sources have said the two are in a committed relationship but taking it slow.  “Ben is in a very committed relationship with Lindsey Shook us and they too work hard to balance time between work, friends and their families,” says the source close to Affleck.  On Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladurée.  Garner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who’s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. “As long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,” another insider said. “She will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.”  RELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend  The actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles. Affleck has his eye on the space that boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms along with a screening room, gym, family room and maid’s room as well as a backyard with pool, spa, outdoor BBQ and guest house.  This comes months after the father of three was first spotted house hunting with Shookus.  “Ben is looking to buy a family friendly house,” a source previously told PEOPLE in October 2017. “Lindsay shared her opinions, but it was clear that they are not buying a house together.”  Affleck had been living in a rental since he moved out of the family estate he used to share with Garner.

       " 'Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, making her the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.  The 44-year-old actress tweeted that Seagal “unzipped his leather pants” while they were in his office. Rossi was auditioning for a role in the actor’s movie.  “My final audition for a Steven Segal [sic] movie took place in his office.

       " 'Fitness guru Richard Simmons arrives at the Project Angel Food’s 2013 Angel Awards in Los Angeles. (Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)  After Richard Simmons disappeared from the public eye on Feb. 15, 2014, his name suddenly filled headlines again.  Most stories — including the popular “Missing Richard Simmons” podcast — theorized as to why he suddenly became so reclusive. Two publications, though, offered an answer.  In June 2016 and March 2017, sister tabloids National Enquirer and Radar Online published a series of stories claiming Simmons was busy undergoing “shocking sex surgery” — receiving breast implants, hormone treatments and considering medical castration as he transitioned from male to female. The publications referred to him as “the new Caitlyn Jenner” and said he was “now living as a gal named Fiona.”  Accompanying these stories were several photographs, including those of Simmons wearing a black dress and a coral wig. Simmons, of course, is well-known for wearing outrageous outfits.  Richard Simmons says he did not get a sex change.  On Monday, he filed a libel lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against American Media, the owner of National Enquirer and Radar Online, for these “cruel and malicious” articles. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages along with a retraction of the stories, an apology and an injunction.  The lawsuit claimed the publications “cheaply and crassly commercialized and sensationalized an issue that ought to be treated with respect and sensitivity.”  [L.A. police reportedly say Richard Simmons is fine: ‘If he wants to go out in public or see anybody he will do that’]  The suit claims the publications chose to paint Simmons as transgender because his history of supporting the LGBT community would make it more difficult for him to sue. (Simmons has never spoken openly about his own sexual identity. He has danced around the issue, though, such as when he told Wendy Williams that “any moment I could just go right up in flames.”)  If he were to deny such a rumor, therefore, it might appear that Simmons thought being transgender was a negative thing.  “For Mr. Simmons to sue, the National Enquirer and Radar Online have cynically calculated, will make Mr. Simmons appear to maintain that there is something wrong with transitioning from one gender to another,” the lawsuit stated. “To remain passive and do nothing, the calculation continues, will be seen as tacitly conceding the truth of the stories, encouraging more of them.”  It continued, “National Enquirer and Radar Online have miscalculated.”  Indeed, Simmons made a rare public statement against the stories as early as June 2016. In a Facebook post, he reaffirmed his own support of the LGBT community and asked his followers to join him — particularly in the wake of the June 12, 2016, Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting.  “Although I am not transitioning, I have and always will be supportive of those who are going through their journey,” he wrote. “We should not lose focus on showing love, strength and compassion to all of the LGBT community during these tragic times. My broken heart and healing thoughts are with the people of Orlando and all other victims of prejudice, bigotry and hate.”  [Richard Simmons tells fans he’s not missing, ‘just a little under the weather’]  The publications defended themselves in a statement claiming that for Simmons to say “his privacy has been invaded is hypocritical when his entire livelihood is based upon the public consumption of his image.”  It added that Simmons’s retreat from public life is “a legitimate news story that demands coverage.”  “Indeed, it is ironic that Mr. Simmons claims to be an avid supporter of the LGBTQ community while at the same time alleges that he was defamed by report that he had transitioned into a female,” the statement continued.  The statement concluded that the stories were “based on credible sources who were in Mr. Simmons’ inner circle.”  That source, according to Simmons’s lawsuit, is Mauro Oliveira, a man who for years “blackmailed, extorted, and stalked” Simmons, beginning in May 2015, “with the intention of destroying career and reputation.”  “Mr. Oliveira contacted the National Enquirer on at least three separate occasions offering three separate stories as to why Mr. Simmons has been absent from the media in the past few years,” the lawsuit stated.  The first story said Simmons was “frail, weak and spiritually broken” and “in desperate need of help.” The second claimed Simmons was being held hostage by his housekeeper who engaged in witchcraft — a rumor repeated on the hit podcast about his disappearance.  “While pitching around these ideas, Mr. Oliveira was simultaneously blackmailing Mr. Simmons, sending him emails and threatening to destroy his reputation with damaging press coverage unless Mr. Simmons paid Mr. Oliveira to stop,” the lawsuit stated.  (Oliveira responded to People magazine: “The allegations are false, and the real story about Richard Simmons will come out eventually.)  America Media is no stranger to lawsuits. The company remains in a legal battle with Phil McGraw (Dr. Phil) and his wife, Robin, who sued the National Enquirer for $250 million after the publication claimed that McGraw abused his wife.  Nonetheless, the company announced it will continue its investigation into Simmons.  “We stand by our reporting about Mr. Simmons, and intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit and win public vindication of our reports,” it said in a statement. “We will also aggressively pursue our ongoing investigation into his life and who is really behind this bizarre and meritless lawsuit.”  More from Morning Mix  Suspect accused of killing two Boston doctors pleads not guilty from hospital bed  Emma Watson takes first major gender-neutral movie award  Netflix’s ’13 Reasons Why’ gets more trigger warnings.

Splash  On Friday, the two were spotted together at New York’s JFK Airport, with the Quantico actress looking super stylish in a baby pink outfit and white jacket.  The family event comes after a series of fun outings for the good-looking pair, who were first linked after attending the 2017 Met Gala together.  In May, the two enjoyed an epic Memorial Day weekend together featuring a string of Bachelor-worthy dates, including a night at the Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert, a visit to a Dodgers game and a day on a boat with pals.  “They sat really close and were talking to each other a lot during the game,” an onlooker at the Dodgers game told ET. “They didn’t show any PDA. It was just the two of them and they definitely were acting very friendly, and couple-like.”  The two were then spotted “cozied up at a table” at a restaurant in West Hollywood, California, on May 31.

       " 'Three months after first revealing the story of her daughter India’s involvement with the group NXIVM, Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg has decided to write a book to share her story with the hope it can also help others.  Her memoir, CAPTIVE: A Mother’s Crusade to Save Her Daughter From a Terrifying Cult, cowritten by PEOPLE contributor Natasha Stoynoff, will be released in Fall and will recount Catherine’s estrangement from her 26-year-old daughter, India, and her attempt to rescue her from what she believes is a dangerous group.  “I was completely ignorant about these sorts of the dangers and traps associated with these so-called personal growth self help groups. It’s an $11 billion, completely unregulated industry, so I reached out to a lot of experts for guidance,” Catherine tells PEOPLE. “What I learned along the way could help others [and] prevent them from falling into the same trap, know what warning signs to look for, and also to give hope to those parents that are struggling and who have lost children to similar situations.  “So many people reached out to me when I went public saying, ‘Oh my God, I’m in the same situation. I’m heartbroken, I’ve lost my child. I don’t know what to do,” she adds.  Allison Michael Orenstein  India was 20 years old when she and her mother attended a meeting as part of a leadership seminar organized by NXIVM in 2011. While the meeting was supposed to provide methods for self-improvement, Catherine told PEOPLE she found the organization “weird and creepy.” India didn’t have the same hesitations and immersed herself in the organization over the next few years.  NXIVM has been around for 20 years, with approximately 16,000 people paying thousands of dollars for experiences like executive-coaching workshops. Run by Keith Raniere, 57, who is known as “Vanguard” to members, NXIVM has offices throughout the country and in Mexico.  Catherine and daughter India Wenn/Alamy  “The mission of NXIVM is to help transform and, ultimately, be an expression of the noble civilization of humans,” the organization states on their website.  Not only do former followers dispute this claim, many have shared horror stories of allegedly having their skin branded with Rainere’s initials and describe the group as a “cult.”  Last April, Catherine claims she learned her daughter was also in potential danger.  Her friend, Bonnie Piesse, 34, had left the group and warned Catherine that India was taking part in what Catherine calls a “secret sisterhood.”  “You need to save your daughter,” Piesse told her, according to Catherine. “You need to save India.”  In December, the New York Times reported that Justice Department has opened an investigation into NXIVM.  Catherine and young daughter India Ron Galella/WireImage  But that doesn’t ease Catherine’s immediate concerns for her daughter.  Catherine previously told PEOPLE that she learned India was on a restrictive diet, suffered hair loss, and hadn’t had her period in a year. Now she says she’s told that India is eating more because “they’re trying to look more normal,” but says she’s still worried.  After Catherine decided to go public with her allegations in October, India became angry and further withdrew from her. Catherine tells PEOPLE that India was recently in Los Angeles, but wasn’t willing to see her.  “She was in L.A. and I was hoping that was a good sign, and I was very distressed when she flew back [to NXIVM’s headquarters Albany],” Catherine says. “Even is she’s not willing to see me, the fact that she’s outside of their sphere of influence physically gave me hope.”  “I’m assuming they kept her on a tight leash so that they still had a lot of influence over her,” she says. “Because if she [leaves the group], that’s a tremendous blow to [NXIVM] considering she’s been such a public figure for them.

       " 'Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.  / Source: Today By Rheana Murray  Adriana Lima is best known for showing off her figure in lingerie and sexy outfits for Victoria\\'s Secret — but now that might all change.  The supermodel and mom of two recently announced on Instagram that she won\\'t take her clothes off anymore for \"an empty cause.\"  Lima, 36, explained that the idea struck after talking to a friend who explained that she was \"unhappy in her body.\"  \"Then it made me think ... that every day in my life, I wake up thinking, how do I look? Was I going to be accepted in my job?\" Lima, who is from Brazil, wrote. \"And in that moment I realized that (the) majority of women probably wake up every morning trying to fit in a stereotype that society/social media/fashion etc., imposed.\"  She added that women can\\'t continue \"living in a world with such superficial values.\"  \"It\\'s not fair for us,\" Lima wrote. \"Beyond fair, it\\'s physically and mentally not healthy.\"  Supermodel Adriana Lima says she won\\'t take her clothes off anymore for \\'an empty cause.\\' She made the announcement in an Instagram post about the stereotypes and pressure women face. Getty Images  The model also wrote about the \"pressure\" she faces as a model, adding that she has her own insecurities.  Not taking her clothes off except for worthy causes appears to be Lima\\'s way of taking a stand against the beauty standards women face. But it will be a stark change from her history with Victoria\\'s Secret. Just last month, the lingerie giant hosted its annual fashion show in Shanghai, featuring Lima and other high-profile models, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Candice Swanepoel, strutting the runway in bright-colored lingerie separates and outrageously festive wings.

       " 'Luann de Lesseps has plead not guilty to her arrest charges on Christmas Eve, PEOPLE confirms.  The Real Housewives of New York star entered her not guilty plea days before New Year’s. De Lesseps, 52, was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 after attacking a police officer in Palm Beach — nearly a year after she wed now-ex-husband Tom D’Agostino in the Florida destination.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  She had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.  An assistant state’s attorney told the Palm Beach Post that de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one police officer. She also reportedly told people, “I’m going to kill you all,” before her arrest.  In a statement to PEOPLE, de Lesseps — who was released on her own recognizance that same day — said, “This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.”  A source told PEOPLE that “Luann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago — it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.”  “Memories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,” the source added.  Days after her arrest, she exclusively told PEOPLE that she would be checking herself into a treatment facility.  “After the events of last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,” she said. “I have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.”  “I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,” she continued.',\n",

       " 'Matt Lauer may no longer be a part of the Today show family, but he still stays in touch with his former colleagues on the morning news program.  “Yeah, we keep in touch with him,” Hoda Kotb, who replaced Lauer as co-anchor alongside Savannah Guthrie, told The Hollywood Reporter for its 35 Most Powerful People in New York Media 2018 issue.  Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire/Getty  “I mean look, this is one of those complex situations,” admitted Kotb, 53, who received a congratulatory text from Lauer when she was named co-anchor in early January. “I’ve known him since I started working at NBC [in 1998]. When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that … you know, he was incredible in that way.”  Though Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn’t discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.  “There is that Matt and then there’s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers’ voices matter and that story matters and it’s … (to Savannah Guthrie) It’s still tough, right?” Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: “Yes.”  It’s been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Guthrie and Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Speaking with PEOPLE following Lauer’s exit, Guthrie, 46, and Kotb opened up about sharing the sobering news with the world.  “I think you could see from the moment that the news happened that our hearts were broken, and in lots of ways, they still are,” Guthrie said. “That feeling was shared through our whole newsroom and our whole Today show staff, because it sounds like cliché or a promo line, but it happens to be true: We are family, and we do love each other, and families do go through hard times, and when that happens in good families, you just get closer. You pull together and you focus on the foundation and what keeps you together. I think that’s what we’ve all been trying to do. And for me, I just am trying to get comfortable with how complicated the feelings around all of it are, and it is complicated. And just trying to have love and compassion for everyone concerned.”  Tyler Essary/Getty  The duo also spoke about Lauer, whom they are continuing to support and only want the best for.  “We know he’s working on his family, we know that for sure. Of course our hearts go out to the brave women who have told their stories,” Guthrie said.  “What we are experiencing and processing now is how to honor and remain a true friend to someone even in spite of learning things that are deeply disturbing,” she added. “And we are trying to navigate that path with integrity.”',\n",
       " 'Christina María Aguilera (born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Born in Staten Island, New York and raised in Rochester and Wexford, Pennsylvania, she appeared on the television series Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club in her early years. After recording \"Reflection\", the theme for Disney\\'s 1998 film Mulan, Aguilera signed with RCA Records.  Aguilera has earned two number-one albums on the US Billboard 200 with her self-titled debut album in 1999 and Back to Basics in 2006. Her albums Stripped (2002), Bionic (2010), Lotus (2012), and Liberation (2018) all reached the top-ten in the United States. Further, her Spanish-language album Mi Reflejo and the holiday album My Kind of Christmas each topped Billboard component charts in 2000. Several of Aguilera\\'s songs have experienced international success, including \"Genie in a Bottle\", \"What a Girl Wants\", and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\" from her self-titled debut, which each topped the Billboard Hot 100, \"Dirrty\", \"Beautiful\", and \"Fighter\" from Stripped, \"Ain\\'t No Other Man\" and \"Hurt\" from Back to Basics, and the collaborations \"Lady Marmalade\", \"Moves like Jagger\", \"Feel This Moment\", and \"Say Something\". Beyond her music career, Aguilera starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and has been featured as a coach on six seasons of the reality competition television series The Voice since 2011.  Aguilera has been recognized as a pop icon and earned the title \"Pop Princess\" in her early years.[1][2] Her work has earned her five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Throughout her career, she has sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide.[3] In 2009, she ranked at number 58 on Rolling Stone\\'s list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, thereby becoming the youngest and the only artist under 30 to be named.[4][5] Billboard recognized her as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s, and Time listed Aguilera among the top 100 Most Influential People in the World of 2013.[6][7] Aside from her work in the entertainment industry, Aguilera is involved in charitable activities through human rights, world issues, and her work as a UN ambassador for the World Food Programme.  Life and career [ edit ]  1980–1998: Early life and career beginnings [ edit ]  Christina María Aguilera was born in the Staten Island borough of New York City, New York, on December 18, 1980, to Shelly Loraine Kearns (née Fidler), a musician, and Fausto Xavier Aguilera, a United States Army soldier.[8] Her father is Ecuadorian, while her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[9][10] Her family moved frequently because of her father\\'s military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[11] Aguilera and her mother alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive,[12] claims which he denied; Aguilera used music as a form of escape from her turbulent household.[13] Following her parents\\' divorce when she was six years old,[10] Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother (who later remarried[14] Jim Kearns and gave birth to one more child, Michael \\'Mikey\\' Kearns),[15] moved into her grandmother\\'s home in the Pittsburgh suburb of Rochester, Pennsylvania.[10] After several years of being estranged, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[16]  Growing up, Aguilera, known locally as \"the little girl with the big voice\",[17] aspired to be a singer, singing in local talent shows and competitions. She won her first talent show at the age of 8, in which she performed Whitney Houston\\'s \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\".[11] In 1990, she appeared on Star Search singing \"A Sunday Kind of Love\", and was eliminated during the semi-final rounds.[13] She later performed the same song during an appearance on Pittsburgh\\'s KDKA-TV\\'s Wake Up with Larry Richert.[18] Throughout her youth in Pittsburgh, Aguilera sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, in addition to the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[19] She attended Rochester Area School District in Rochester and Marshall Middle School near Wexford, and briefly attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before being home schooled due to bullying.[20]  In 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The Mickey Mouse Club, although she did not meet its age requirements. She joined the television series two years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.[21] Her co-stars included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[22] When she was fourteen, Aguilera recorded her first song, the duet \"All I Wanna Do\" with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi.[23] She later sent her cover version of Houston\\'s \"Run to You\" to Walt Disney Pictures in hopes of being selected to record the theme song \"Reflection\" for their animated film Mulan (1998).[24] \"Reflection\" peaked at number 19 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart.[25]  1999–2001: Christina Aguilera, Mi Reflejo, and My Kind of Christmas [ edit ]  After the recording of \"Reflection\", Aguilera attracted attention of RCA Records A&R Ron Fair and was signed with the label quickly afterwards.[26] The label then started presenting Aguilera with tracks to record and laid foundation for her debut album.[27] While initially catering to making Aguilera\\'s debut a \"wonder introduction of a singer\" like Barbra Streisand, RCA was pressurized by contemporary teen pop craze involving Aguilera\\'s peers including Britney Spears, leading to the label rushing the production process and aligning Aguilera to be part of the teen pop trend.[28] They decided the lead single off the album would be \"Genie in a Bottle\", a trendy pop and R&B track released in June 1999.[28] The single was a major commercial success, peaking atop the Billboard Hot 100 and record charts of 20 other countries.[29] It has sold over 7 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling singles worldwide.[30]  Following the success of the single, Aguilera\\'s eponymous debut album was released in August to commercial success, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[31][32] It moved 14 million copies worldwide,[33] and produced three singles, including two Billboard Hot 100 number ones \"What a Girl Wants\" and \"Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)\", and an All-4-One cover of \"I Turn to You\".[34] The album helped Aguilera win the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 2000 ceremony.[35] Aguiera\\'s two following studio albums Mi Reflejo and My Kind of Christmas were subsequently released in the end of 2000.[36] The former topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums for nineteen consecutive weeks and was certified six times platinum in the Latin field by the RIAA.[37][32] It won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the 2001 ceremony.[38]  In support of her albums, Aguilera embarked on her first concert tour Christina Aguilera in Concert from mid-2000 to early 2001, visiting North America, Europe, South America, and Japan.[39][40] Thanks to her success throughout 2000, Billboard recognized Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of the Year.[41] Despite her early success, Aguilera was displeased with the music and image her management Steve Kurtz had aligned her to, feeling unable to control her own image.[42] Aguilera\\'s views of Kurtz\\'s influence in matters of her creative direction, the role of being her exclusive personal manager, and over-scheduling had in part caused her to seek legal means of terminating their management contract. In October 2000, Aguilera filed a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Kurtz for improper, undue and inappropriate influence over her professional activities, as well as fraud. After terminating Kurtz\\'s services, Irving Azoff was hired as her new manager.[43]  Aguilera\\'s first take on more artistic control was expressed in the 2001 Moulin Rouge! cover of Labelle\\'s \"Lady Marmalade\", which also saw the contribution of Pink, Mya and Lil Kim.[44] Originally opposed by RCA executives for being \"too urban\" and \"too Rockwilder and Missy\", Aguilera insisted on recording the song.[42] \"Lady Marmalade\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks based on airplay alone, becoming the first airplay-only track in history to remain on the chart\\'s top spot for more than one week.[45][46] It earned a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 2002 ceremony.[47] Later in 2001, an album titled Just Be Free containing demo tracks recorded by Aguilera in 1994 and 1995 was released by Warlock Records without Aguilera\\'s permission. She subsequently filed a suit against Warlock Records and the album\\'s producers to stop the release.[48] The two parties came to a confidential settlement to release the album, in which Aguilera lent out her name, likeness, and image for an unspecified amount of damages.[49]  2002–2003: Stripped [ edit ]  When planning her fourth studio album, Aguilera leaned towards a new artistic direction that she felt had more musical and lyrical depth.[50] She named the album Stripped and explained that the title represented \"a new beginning, a re-introduction of [herself] as a new artist in a way\".[51] For the album, Aguilera served as executive producer and co-wrote most of the songs.[52][53] The album was preceded by the single \"Dirrty\", which was released to shed Aguilera\\'s teen pop image and express her sexuality and aggression.[54] Its accompanying music video generated controversy for depicting various sexual fetishes and concepts.[55] Aguilera\\'s new image presented in the video started to overshadow her music,[56] generating widespread criticism from both her peers including Shakira and Jessica Simpson and the public.[57][58] Aguilera defended her new image, explaining that \"I\\'m in the power position, in complete command of everything and everybody around me. To be totally balls-out like that is, for me, the measure of a true artist.\"[58]  The final cut of Stripped incorporated various genres from flamenco and R&B to rock and lyrically revolved around the theme of self-esteem while also discussing sex and gender equality.[59][53] It was released in October 2002 to mixed critical reviews;[60] Jancee Dunn from the Rolling Stone praised Aguilera\\'s vocals yet panned the album for its lack of musical concentration.[59] The album was nonetheless a commercial success, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 and has sold over 4.3 million copies in the United States.[61] It was a major success in the United Kingdom, having sold 2 million copies and became the second highest-selling album by a female US artist of the 2000s decade, behind Norah Jones with Come Away with Me.[62][63] Stripped has sold over 12 million copies worldwide.[64] The album was followed by four singles, \"Beautiful\", \"Fighter\", \"Can\\'t Hold Us Down\", and \"The Voice Within\". \"Beautiful\" received universal acclaim for positive portrayal of the LGBT community and was the album\\'s most commercially successful single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[65] It earned Aguilera a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony.[66] The song was later listed at number 52 among the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s by the Rolling Stone in 2011.[67]  During the promotion of Stripped, Aguilera cultivated a new image by adopting the alter ego Xtina, dyeing her hair black, and debuting several tattoos and piercings.[68][69] She co-headlined the Justified and Stripped Tour alongside Justin Timberlake from June to September 2003 in support of Stripped and Timberlake\\'s album Justified, before embarking on her solo The Stripped Tour until December.[70][71] Aguilera garnered media attention after attending the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards in August, where she and Britney Spears kissed Madonna during their performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\".[72] Later that year, she was the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, where she won an award for Best Female.[73] Billboard also announced Aguilera as the Top Female Pop Act of 2003.[74]  2004–2009: Back to Basics [ edit ]  In 2004, Aguilera recorded a revised version of Rose Royce\\'s \"Car Wash\" with Missy Elliott for the animated film Shark Tale, in which she was also a voice actress.[75] Later that year, she and Nelly performed \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards;[76] the song was subsequently released as a single from Nelly\\'s album Sweat.[77] Aguilera also contributed vocals to Herbie Hancock\\'s 2005 cover of Leon Russell\\'s \"A Song for You\", which was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 48th ceremony.[78] During this time, Aguilera started working on her follow-up studio album while embracing an image inspired by public figures of the \"Old Hollywood glam era\" including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, and Mary Pickford, debuting blonde curly hair and retro-styled makeup.[76][79]  Aguilera\\'s fifth studio album Back to Basics was released in August 2006. The double album, according to Aguilera, was \"a throwback to the 20s, 30s, and 40s-style jazz, blues, and feel-good soul music, but with a modern twist\".[80] During the recording process, Aguilera was much inspired by works of classic blues and soul singers including Otis Redding, Millie Jackson, and Nina Simone, which she described as \"music that really had heart\".[81] The album was released to generally positive critical feedback, with compliments regarding its retro-oriented styles and Aguilera\\'s vocals.[82] It debuted atop the Billboard 200 and has sold over 5 million copies worldwide,[83] of which 1.7 million copies were sold in the United States.[61] The album was preceded by \"Ain\\'t No Other Man\", which reached number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has sold 1.7 million digital copies in the United States.[61] The song\\'s music video saw Aguilera portraying her new alter ego Baby Jane.[84] The single won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, where Aguilera performed a rendition of \"It\\'s a Man\\'s Man\\'s Man\\'s World\" in tribute of James Brown.[85]  Back to Basics was succeeded by two singles, \"Hurt\" and \"Candyman\". \"Slow Down Baby\" was released exclusively in Australia as the fourth single,[86] while \"Oh Mother\" was the fourth in Europe.[87] In support of Back to Basics, Aguilera embarked on the Back to Basics Tour, commencing in November 2006 in Europe, visiting North America, Asia, and Oceania, and ending in October 2008 in the United Arab Emirates.[88][89][90][91] Billboard Boxscore announced the Back to Basic Tour as the highest-grossing solo female tour of 2007, with US$48.1M grossed.[92] Forbes recognized Aguilera as the nineteenth-richest woman in entertainment as of January 2007, with a net worth of US$60 million.[93]  Later that year, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary Shine a Light chronicling a two-day Rolling Stones concert in New York City\\'s Beacon Theatre, in which Aguilera performs \"Live with Me\" alongside the band\\'s lead vocalist Mick Jagger.[94] In commemoration of a decade-long career in the music industry, Aguilera released a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin\\' Better: A Decade of Hits exclusively through Target on November 11, 2008, in the United States.[95] In addition to previous singles, it included four newly-recorded electropop-oriented songs, two of which are remade versions of two previous singles.[96][97] Aguilera revealed that the newly-recorded tracks featured \"a very futurisic, robotic sound\" that served as a preview for her follow-up studio album.[98] The release peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, while its titular single \"Keeps Gettin\\' Better\" charted at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.[34] In 2009, Billboard recognized Aguilera as the 20th most successful artist of the 2000s.[99]  2010–2011: Bionic, Burlesque, and The Voice [ edit ]  Aguilera in 2010  Aguilera\\'s sixth studio album Bionic was released in June 2010. The album drew inspirations from electronic genres, which had influenced Aguilera during her pregnancy.[100] Critical response to the album was mixed, with some critics not welcoming the change in musical styles as well as the content of the lyrics for being \"cringeworthy\".[101] Bionic struggled to match the chart impact and sales of her previous albums, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 and has sold 315,000 copies in the United States.[34][61] \"Not Myself Tonight\" and \"You Lost Me\" were released as singles internationally, while \"Woohoo\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj was released as a single in the United States and several European countries,[102][103] and \"I Hate Boys\" was released exclusively to Australian airplay services.[104]  In November 2010, Aguilera starred alongside Cher in the film Burlesque.[105] The film was written and directed by Steve Antin,[106] and grossed $90 million.[107] It was met with mixed reviews from critics, who criticized it for being \"campy and clichéd\", yet praised Aguilera\\'s acting.[108] Burlesque received a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[109] Aguilera contributed eight tracks to the film\\'s accompanying soundtrack, while Cher performed the other two.[110] The soundtrack reached number 18 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[32]  At the Super Bowl XLV in February 2011, Aguilera omitted a few lines while performing the U.S. national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".[111] She later apologized, saying, \"I got so caught up in the moment of the song that I lost my place. I can only hope that everyone could feel my love for this country and that the true spirit of its anthem still came through\".[112] She performed at the opening act of the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, alongside Jennifer Hudson, Martina McBride, Yolanda Adams, and Florence Welch, paying tribute to Aretha Franklin.[113] In April 2011, Aguilera served as a coach on the television series The Voice and went on for its three first seasons until December 2012.[114] During the first season, Aguilera was featured on Maroon 5\\'s single \"Moves like Jagger\" upon the invitation of the group\\'s lead vocalist and Aguilera\\'s fellow The Voice coach Adam Levine. The single peaked atop Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles worldwide with 7 million copies sold.[115][116]  2012–2017: Lotus, and television projects [ edit ]  Aguilera\\'s seventh studio album Lotus was released in November 2012. She described it as a \"rebirth\" of herself after the personal struggles she had overcome during the Bionic album era.[68] It peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 and has sold 290,000 copies in the United States.[61] The album has become her least commercially successful album so far.[117] The album was preceded by two singles, \"Your Body\" and \"Just a Fool\". During the promotion of Lotus in December 2012, Aguilera was temporarily replaced by Shakira for the fourth season of The Voice and returned for the fifth season in September 2013.[118][119]  While Aguilera\\'s seventh studio album Lotus was commercially unsuccessful, she subsequently found her revitalized success through collaborations with other artists. She was featured on Pitbull\\'s single \"Feel This Moment\" in January 2013, which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.[34] She subsequently appeared on Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández\\'s cover of \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti\", which earned a diamond certification in Mexico.[120] Aguilera\\'s duet of \"Say Something\" with A Great Big World, released in November 2013, was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, earning a six-time platinum certification from the RIAA and winning a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.[32][121]  For the sixth and seventh seasons of The Voice, Aguilera was respectively replaced by Shakira and Gwen Stefani, clarifying that she wanted to devote her time to her family.[122][123] She subsequently returned as a coach for the eighth and tenth seasons; for the latter she won with her contestant Alisan Porter and became the first female coach to win the show.[124][125]  In April 2015, Aguilera played a recurring role as singer Jade St. John on the third season of ABC\\'s musical drama series Nashville.[126] In March 2016, Aguilera and Rutler were announced as executive producers for a new music-based game show, Tracks, to air on Spike TV.[127] Aguilera recorded a song titled \"Change\", which was dedicated to the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting as well as Christina Grimmie, who was fatally shot in Orlando the day before the nightclub shooting, in June 2016. The proceedings were donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims\\' families.[128] She further recorded a disco song titled \"Telepathy\" featuring Nile Rodgers for the soundtrack of Netflix original series The Get Down in August 2016,[129] contributed as a voice actress for The Emoji Movie,[130] and was announced to had been cast for the film Zoe in May 2017.[131]  2018: Liberation [ edit ]  Aguilera released her eighth studio album, titled Liberation, on June 15.[132] The album debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200, becoming her seventh US Top 10 album.[133] Its lead promo single, \"Accelerate\", was released on May 3, while second single \"Fall In Line\", featuring Demi Lovato, was released on May 20, one day after they performed it together on the 2018 Billboard Music Awards.[134] She will also embark on the Liberation Tour, her first concert tour in over a decade.[135]  Artistry [ edit ]  Voice [ edit ]  Aguilera is a soprano,[136][137][138] having a vocal range spanning four octaves (from B♭ 2 to C♯ 7 ), four notes, a semitone and the whistle register.[139][140][141][142][143] Since the start of her career Aguilera\\'s voice has been compared to that of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.[144] David Browne writing for The New York Times noted that Aguilera\\'s vocal performance was highly influenced by Carey and Houston, sharing that \"Aguilera has been one of the foremost practitioners of the overpowering, Category 5 vocal style known as melisma\", and \"Ms. Carey, Ms. Houston and Ms. Aguilera, to name its three main champions, are most associated with the period from the late \\'80s through the late \\'90s\".[144] A journal by Ann Powers for the Los Angeles Times said there are influences of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin on Aguilera\\'s vocal style, opining that the \"Aguilera\\'s Streisand-esque tendencies\" \"[help Aguilera] figure out how to become the \\'great singer\\' she\\'s been dubbed since she released her first single, the wise-beyond-its-years \\'Genie in a Bottle\\', at 18\".[145] Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in The New Yorker, \"Aguilera doesn\\'t need to reincarnate Sarah Vaughan to be a serious singer. She already is one, in the tradition of nineteen-nineties pop and R&B, skillfully deploying melisma for razzle-dazzle\".[146] In 2003, Aguilera was placed 5th on MTV\\'s \"Best Voices in Music Ever\" list,[147] while ranking atop both COVE and Latina magazine\\'s best Pop and Latina vocalist of all time in 2004 and 2013 respectively.[148][149] In a review for Liberation, Jon Pareles of The New York Times describes Aguilera\\'s vocal versatility, stating; \"Nothing less than high drama suits Christina Aguilera’s voice. She can be brassy, tearful, sultry, gritty, breathy, sweet or furious. She can belt and she can tease; she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, scalloping melismas. Her voice is not an instrument for making modest statements; it’s about peaks of self-affirmation, indescribable sensual pleasures, steely counterattacks and abysses of sorrow\".[150]  Aguilera has, however, been criticized for her excessive use of melisma and oversinging on songs and in concerts.[151][152][153][154] John Eskow of The Huffington Post named Aguilera a main proponent for \"oversouling\", described as the \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[155] Lucy Davies, a writer for BBC Music, opined that although Aguilera had \"a stunning voice\", she \"could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the \\'y-e-e-eeeh, woah yeh\\'s\\'\".[156] Longtime producer Linda Perry, who wrote the song \"Beautiful\", revealed about the recording sessions with Aguilera, \"I tried to keep it straight. I told her to get rid of the finger waves. Every time she\\'d start going into \\'hoo-ha\\', I\\'d stop the tape. I\\'m like, \\'You\\'re doing it again\\'\". Perry ended up using the song\\'s first take adding, \"She had a hard time accepting that as the final track. She\\'s a perfectionist. She knows her voice really well, and she knows what\\'s going on. She can hear things that nobody else would catch.\"[157] An editor from Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman, stated that the oversinging on Aguilera\\'s albums was inspired by Carey, writing that \"the Mariah venerators don\\'t get away with it so easily. Aguilera, for one thing, has a slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she\\'s overselling a song\".[152]  Influences [ edit ]  (pictured) as her main influence Aguilera cites Etta James as her main influence  Aguilera has credited blues singer Etta James as her main influence and inspiration, elaborating, \"Etta is my all-time favorite singer. I\\'ve said it for the last seven years – since I had my first debut record out – in every interview\".[158] Following James\\' death in 2012, Aguilera was asked to perform \"At Last\" at James\\' funeral.[159] Prior to the performance, Aguilera revealed, \"There\\'s a line in this song that says \\'I found a dream that I could speak to.\\' And for me that dream, all my life, has been Etta James\".[160] Other classic artists, including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, and Ella Fitzgerald, are also Aguilera\\'s major influences; her fifth studio album Back to Basics is inspired by vintage jazz, blues and soul music records by them.[161][162][163]  Aguilera mentions Whitney Houston as another influence,[164] having performed many of her songs in her early years during talent shows.[11] She also cites Mariah Carey and Celine Dion as an inspiration, and covered the latter\\'s songs: \"These Are the Special Times\" on My Kind of Christmas, and \"The Prayer\" on the NBC reality singing competition The Voice.[165][166] Aguilera\\'s debut album producer Ron Harris revealed that Aguilera during her recording sessions for Christina Aguilera would constantly listen Brandy\\'s music, studying and trying to replicate her adlibs.[167] According to author Pier Dominguez of the book Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made, Aguilera stated that Carey and her debut single, \"Vision of Love\" (1990), had the biggest influence on her vocal style.[168] Aguilera points out the musical film The Sound of Music and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, as her first inspiration for singing and performing.[169] At the age of six, the film helped Aguilera cope with her violent childhood, \"Bad things happened in my home; there was violence. The Sound of Music looked like a form of release.\"[13] Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as two biggest inspirations for her image, \"for being re-inventive and being brave as strong females, to explore whatever, even if they do get bad press. It\\'s just like they were fearless.\"[170] During the promotion of Back to Basics, her image was also inspired by the \"Golden age of Hollywood\" actresses including Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Carole Lombard, Greta Garbo and Veronica Lake.[171] Aguilera is also inspired by her Burlesque co-star, Cher: \"I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We\\'ve had similar costumes too!\"[172]  Musical style and themes [ edit ]  Aguilera frequently blends elements of pop, R&B, dance-pop and soul music into her projects,[173][174][175][176] her records typically include a combination of ballads and uptempo tracks.[177] Christina Aguilera (1999) prominently displayed teen pop and dance-pop music,[178] while Mi Reflejo (2000) takes inspiration from Latin music.[179] Her first Christmas album, My Kind of Christmas, combines covers of Christmas standards and several original dance-pop tracks.[180] Aiming for musical diversity and artistic growth, Aguilera worked with R&B, rock, hip hop, and Latin music for Stripped (2002).[42][181] David Browne from Entertainment Weekly credited the release with distancing Aguilera from her pop contemporaries.[181] Aguilera leaned towards R&B, blues, jazz, and soul on Back to Basics (2006).[80][182][183]  In contrast, Bionic (2010) sees significant use from futuristic electronic music, described as an electropop album.[100][184][185] The soundtrack for her 2010 feature film Burlesque (2010) was influenced by Cabaret, and featured several established songs that were redone as dance numbers in a fashion similar to Moulin Rouge! (2001).[186] Aguilera partnered with mainstream producers including Shellback and Max Martin during production of Lotus (2012); when discussing her interactions with the latter, she commented that \"He\\'s known about me but we haven\\'t crossed paths,\" adding \"Those records were the kind I wanted to stray apart from. If you look at what I did in the past (after my debut), I always try to do things that will challenge me and challenge the listener, too.\"[187]  Aguilera has commented that she feels a sense of responsibility to reference portions of her personal life so that \"people that can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance.\" Many of her works consequently discuss love; she has also co-written two tracks which dealt with the domestic abuse throughout her childhood.[188] Aguilera has frequently mentioned feminism in her music; she has expressed her belief that sexuality is \"very empowering\", and has commented that \"If I want to be sexual, it\\'s for my own appreciation and enjoyment! That\\'s why I like to talk about the fact that sometimes I am attracted to women. I appreciate their femininity and beauty.\"[189] She has alluded to her physical attractions to women in other interviews as well.[190][191] Her \"Can\\'t Hold Us Down\" from Stripped denounces gender-related double standards, in which men are applauded for their sexual behaviors, while women who behave in a similar fashion are disdained.[192] The main theme of Bionic was also about woman empowerment; Hermione Hoby from The Guardian opined that \"she incites more of a sisterly spirit of collaboration, including riot grrrl feminists Le Tigre. Aguilera\\'s not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself.\"[136] In regards to production, Aguilera has often verbalized her preference of working with more \"obscure\" collaborators, and noted that she is not necessarily inclined to contact \"the No.1 chart-toppers in music\" because of their popular demand.[193] The New York Times\\' Kelefa Sanneh described her decision to work with DJ Premier on Back to Basics as \"a decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely.\"[194]  Image [ edit ]  Aguilera has reinvented her public image on numerous occasions throughout her career.[195] In the later 1990s, her then-manager Steve Kurtz marketed her as a bubblegum pop entertainer to capitalize on the genre\\'s financial lure,[50] which earned her recognition as a teen idol.[196] Aguilera introduced her alter ego \"Xtina\" during 2002 and 2003, which presented an increasingly provocative persona.[197][198] During this time, she dyed her hair black, debuted several piercings, and participated in several nude pictorials for publications.[68] In 2004, Aguilera embraced a more \"mature\" image with retro-styled hair and makeup, which was inspired by classic movie stars including Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich and Mary Pickford.[79] This reinvention was named \"Baby Jane\" in 2006, an alter ego which was taken from the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.[199] Aguilera received widespread criticism over her curvy figure from gaining weight in 2012.[200] She later received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss in 2013.[201] In 2018 Aguilera appeared bare-faced without makeup and retouching on the cover of Paper magazine and received widespread praise.[202][203]  Wax figure of Aguilera at Madame Tussauds in London  Aguilera is considered a pop icon,[204] and has frequently garnered comparisons to Britney Spears.[205][206] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that Aguilera is \"too eager not to offend\" in her mild-mannered music, making her a \"good girl pretending to be bad\", and also said that Spears\\' \"artificial-sweetener voice\" was a welcome change of pace from Aguilera\\'s \"numbing vocal gymnastics\".[207] Matthew Horton from Virgin Media suggested that Aguilera was a more impressive performer than Spears despite her lower sales figures.[205] Aguilera has also been regarded as a sex symbol.[146][208] A 2003 issue of Maxim magazine that she covered became its best-selling issue;[209] Aguilera was named \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" by its subscribers later that year,[210] and also earned the magazine its best-selling issue after posing on the cover that year.[211] Additionally recognized as a gay icon,[212][213] she was the first honoree on The Abbey\\'s Gay Walk of Fame for her contributions to the LGBT community.[214] The music video for \"Beautiful\" earned Aguilera a GLAAD Media Award for its positive portrayal of the LGBT community.[215]  Fashion has also been a part of Aguilera\\'s music career and image.[216] She has frequently worn clothes designed by Roberto Cavalli, John Galliano, Marc Jacobs, and Alexander McQueen.[217][218] During the Back to Basics Tour in 2006, Aguilera performed in a stole made of fur designed by Roberto Cavalli, unaware that it was made from real fur of a white fox. After receiving a video about the treatment of foxes from PETA vice president Dan Mathews, Aguilera replaced it with a faux-fur stole, further stating that she was \"very upset\" because she \"only ever wears fake fur\".[219] Aguilera\\'s costumes from Burlesque were featured in the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising\\'s Art of Motion Picture Costume Design exhibition.[220] Wax figures of Aguilera are located at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London and New York City.[221][222]  Legacy [ edit ]  Aguilera has sold 17.9 million records in the United States,[61] and over 75 million albums and singles worldwide.[223] Gregory Hicks from The Michigan Daily opined that \"Aguilera deserves to be known as one of the greatest artists to ever hit the pop industry.\"[224] In 2012, VH1 named Aguilera the eighth greatest woman in the music industry.[225] Aguilera has also been recognized as one of the greatest vocalists of all time,[226][227] and is commonly referred to as \"The Voice of a Generation\".[228] Aguilera topped Cove magazine\\'s list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists\".[229] She was ranked fifth in MTV and Blender magazine\\'s 2003 countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music.[230] In November 2008, Rolling Stone placed Aguilera at number 58 on its list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, writing that \"[Aguilera] has had the finesse and power of a blues queen ever since she was a child star\".[4] At the 2013 People\\'s Choice Awards, Aguilera was awarded the People\\'s Voice Award, which recognized Aguilera\\'s ability to reach millions of people across various genres.[231] In 2013, Aguilera was one of Time\\'s 100 Most Influential People in the World. In the article for the magazine, Celine Dion wrote, \"Without a doubt, [Aguilera]\\'s one of the most talented artists the world has ever seen and heard, and I think she\\'s going to continue to amaze us for many, many years to come.\"[7]  Aguilera is also well known for her television and music video impact; in 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times commented that Aguilera \"will be remembered for her glamour, her scandalous take on femme-pop and her Brobdingnagian voice, and ... as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music-competition reality programming\".[232] She was considered as one of the greatest women of the music video era by VH1.[233] Aguilera\\'s use of sexual imagery has catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett, co-founder of The Vagenda, opined that the provocative dance routines in Aguilera\\'s music videos are \"empowering\".[234] Writing for The Hampton Institute, critic Terry Young, Jr. commented that Aguilera \"redefined the 21st century female pop performer\". He added that following the release of Stripped, \"artists like Spears and Beyoncé became more comfortable expressing sexuality and no longer felt the need to sell the notion of innocence\".[235] Aguilera\\'s works have earned her numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards.[236] In November 2010, Aguilera was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[237] In October 2012, Aguilera\\'s costumes and video collection was included on the \"Women Who Rock\" exhibition by the National Museum of Women in the Arts.[238] Aguilera has inspired various artists, including: Ariana Grande,[239] Tinashe,[240] Meghan Trainor,[241] Jordin Sparks,[242] Demi Lovato,[243] Camryn,[244] Kelly Clarkson,[4] Alexandra Burke,[245] Charli XCX,[246] Selena Gomez,[247] Lady Gaga,[248] Ashley Tisdale,[249] Charice,[250] Sam Smith,[251] Sabrina Carpenter,[252] Candice Glover,[253] Jasmine Trias,[254] Karmin,[255] Jessie J,[256] and Louisa Johnson.[257]  Lady Gaga cited Aguilera and her cover of All-4-One\\'s \"I Turn to You\" as an inspiration for Gaga\\'s vocal range, elaborating; \"When I was 15, I was singing \"I Turn to You\" at the top of my lungs. She was an inspiration to me to have a wider vocal range.\"[258] Demi Lovato explained that she was inspired by Aguilera\\'s themes, \"I had a lot of respect for Whitney Houston, and Christina Aguilera, on some songs where she was really amazing and wasn\\'t trying to be sexy or anything like that. I just found that I had more respect for artists that didn\\'t talk about that stuff, and those were the ones that were more successful.\"[243] Aguilera\\'s works has also inspired some athletes, including American figure skater Johnny Weir[259] and American swimmer Dana Vollmer.[260]  Personal life [ edit ]  During Christina Aguilera in Concert tour, Aguilera was involved in a romantic relationship with dancer Jorge Santos, which ultimately ended in September 2001.[261]  Aguilera began dating marketing executive Jordan Bratman in 2003, and became engaged in February 2005 after two years together.[262] The couple married on November 19, 2005 at an estate in Napa County, California.[263] On January 12, 2008, Aguilera gave birth to a son with Bratman.[264]  Aguilera and Bratman separated in September 2010. Aguilera filed for divorce from Bratman in October, requesting joint legal and physical custody of their son.[265] After reaching a private settlement and custody deal, their divorce was finalized on April 15, 2011.[266]  Aguilera concurrently began a romantic relationship with Matthew Rutler, who served as an assistant on the set of Burlesque.[267] On March 1, 2011, the couple was arrested for public intoxication in West Hollywood.[268] They were later released on bail and no charges were filed.[269]  Aguilera became engaged to Rutler in February 2014.

       " 'It was a very dark time for me, singer says  Kelly Clarkson has spoken about depression, weight and body image in a new interview.  The singer – who won the first season of American Idol in 2002 – recently spoke to Attitude about the “dark time” in her early career, saying: “When I was really skinny, I wanted to kill myself. I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life. But no one cared, because aesthetically you make sense.”  “It was a very dark time for me,” Clarkson added. “I thought the only way out was quitting. I like wrecked my knees and my feet because all I would do is put in headphones and run. I was at the gym all the time.”  Clarkson went on to say that she realised things needed to change around the release of her third album ‘My December’ in 2007. “There’s a song on ‘My December’ called Sober. There’s this line ‘picked the weeds but kept the flowers’ and I just live my life by that because you are who you surround yourself with,” she said.  “I was around some really negative people, and I got out of it because I had a lot of great people there too. It was a case of turning around, facing them and walking toward the light.”  Clarkson has since taken to social media to clarify her comments. “Just to clear something up. I wasn’t ever miserable because I had to be thin. I said I was miserable & as a result I became thin,” she tweeted.  “I’ve never contemplated suicide because of my weight.I said people had no idea I was unhappy oddly enough because I appeared healthy,” the singer added.  Meanwhile, Clarkson recently revealed that she refused a writing credit because she didn’t want her name next to Dr Luke’s. The producer (real name Lukasz Gottwald) has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Kesha since October 2014, when the singer filed a lawsuit citing “mental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault”. He denies the allegations.  If you are experiencing problems, you can find help from suicide prevention charity SAVE. For more information and advice on eating disorders, visit BEAT.',\n",

To read his full statement, click below!  “My family and I are overwhelmed with this tragedy, but we are sticking together and we’ll get through it,” Chris Soules, 35, told In Touch. “Thank you for reaching out.”  As it’s previously been reported, Bachelor star Chris Soules was driving a 2008 Chevrolet truck when he crashed into a John Deere tractor driven by fellow Iowan farmer Kenneth Mosher. Chris allegedly checked the 66-year-old man’s pulse and called 911 after the disastrous impact, but he later fled the scene by foot and was arrested at his home just five hours later.  Chris was charged with leaving the scene of an accident with a death (a class D felony), but he was released after posting $10,000 bond. Police also reportedly found alcohol in his truck after the crash.  Chris, who was set to appear on the upcoming season of Bachelor In Paradise, is scheduled to appear in court on May 2. He was also ordered to wear an ankle bracelet and hand over his passport.

       " 'Angelina Jolie is feeling vindicated by Jennifer Aniston’s split from husband Justin Theroux. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details why she’s not shocked by their separation.    Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux‘s sudden split shocked the world, with the exception of her arch-enemy Angelina Jolie. While the 42-year-old humanitarian has long been blamed for the former Friends star’s 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 54, she’s now feeling a sense of vindication that she had nothing to do with America’s Sweetheart’s latest heartbreak. “Angelina makes a point to not read or follow any celebrity gossip, but it was inevitable she would hear about Jennifer and Justin’s break-up at some point. Angelina has never cared for Jen, even before she started dating Brad. She’s always thought of her as very vanilla and shallow, and not on her level intellectually. Whereas Justin is quirky and edgy and super smart, so Angelina wasn’t surprised at all to learn they had split,” a source close to the Maleficent star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  While the now former couple vowed to remain close friends despite the breakup, numerous sources out of his NYC circle seem to be feeding the media that artsy Justin felt stifled by Jen’s easy, breezy California lifestyle and longed to be back home full-time in the Big Apple. He always did seem like a somewhat strange fit for Jennifer, as the actor constantly wore nothing but black motorcycle jackets and had a gold gun pendant around his neck at all times. Everything about him seemed to exude dark, edgy rebel while the actress is a sunny yoga loving Cali-gal.  Angelina has long been blamed for Jen’s heartbreaking split from Brad after they allegedly fell in love while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while the actor was still very married. Even though Brangelina was together for 11 years, married in 2014 and has six children together, the United Nations humanitarian is reveling in the fact that she had nothing to do with Jennifer’s current marriage demise.  “Angelina can’t help feeling a degree of vindication, after all, she was painted as this evil home wrecker who lured Brad away from Jen, who was portrayed as this sweet and nice, poor helpless victim. But nobody can point the finger at Angelina this time, or any other ‘wicked’ third party, as by all accounts neither Justin or Jen were cheating. So this time around Jennifer can’t blame somebody else for the failure of her marriage. It’s all on her and Justin,” our insider adds. Well, at least there won’t be any more “Team Aniston” and Team Jolie” t-shirts being sold after Jen’s latest heartbreak.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Jen will go on to find true love again after her split from Justin?',\n",

       " 'As recently as a month and a half ago, Kanye Westhad serious doubts about the future of his marriage to Kim Kardashian.  In a new interview with The New York Times, the rapper revealed that he had a \"real conversation\" about the possibility of a divorce over controversial remarks he made during an unfiltered appearance on TMZ Live. In May, West sparked widespread backlash when he said slavery was a choice, a statement he also told the NYT was taken out of context.  As Kanye recalled, \"There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, ‘Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\\' So that was a real conversation.\"',\n",
       " \"Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian West aren’t so different – both are massive successes in their respective fields (whether it be singing, reality TV and/or accumulating an impressive social media following) and are constantly in the news for, well, anything they do.  But these two have had a rather interesting history, especially after Kim released footage of Taylor and Kanye West‘s phone call about those “Famous” lyrics, as well as Taylor’s supposed rebuttal in the form of her single, “Look What You Made Me Do.” Let’s take a look back on how we got here.  SEPTEMBER 2009: THE KANYE INCIDENT  It’s important that we start here, even though this situation only involved Taylor and Kanye. You see, since Kanye and Kim later married, Kanye’s past becomes important to Kim’s future. And that time he grabbed the mic from Taylor’s hands during her 2009 VMAs acceptance speech is the root of so much more.  A lot was said about this incident over the years from both sides, from apologies to non-apologies, but Kim didn’t have much to say on the matter – yet.  NOVEMBER 2012: JUST CHILLING  At the 2012 MTV EMAs, Taylor hung out with Kim – who had just started dating Kanye a few months before. They also spent time with Rita Ora , who was dating Rob Kardashian at the time. Yes, yes we were ever so young.  There was also a moment when Kim took a photo for Taylor.  FEBRUARY 2015: GOOD VIBES  Taylor and Kanye were reunited at the 2015 Grammys, and there was no drama to be seen. Taylor enjoyed some nice conversation with Kim. Everyone smiled.  They also embraced! This could really be the start of something beautiful.  They also took a group shot with JAY-Z, because, why not?The whole lovefest sparked rumors of a potential collaboration that West was quick to humor in an interview with Ryan Seacrest . “She wants to get in the studio, and we’re definitely going to go in,” he said. “Any artist with an amazing point of view, perspective, fan base, I’m down to get in the studio and work. I don’t discriminate.”  Sadly, that day never came – but if it had, we would have expected backup vocals from Kim, the artist best known for “Jam (Turn It Up).”  FEBRUARY 2015: PARTY TIME  Britt Awards!!! @TaylorSwift @samsmithworld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 25, 2015 at 5:54pm PST  The two reunited at the 2015 Brit Awards. Kim shared a group photo with Taylor, Kanye and Sam Smith.  They also had a beautiful moment with Karlie Kloss and Derek Blasberg.  Plus, when Kanye performed, Kim was treated to a front-row view of The Taylor Swift Award Show Dancing Extravaganza. Lucky Kim!  via GIPHY  JUNE 2015: SISTERLY BOND  https://www.instagram.com/p/4c9IgIDvAL/  The squad joined forces at Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour stop in London, kicking off a summer full of guest appearances up on the stage. One certain member of the squad to note: Kendall Jenner, Kim’s sister.  In fact, a few members of Taylor’s friend circle are also friendly with Kim, including Gigi Hadid and Cara Delevingne (who also go by Slay-Z and Mother Chucker).  AUGUST 2015: BEST NIGHT EVER  Six years after that original night at the VMAs, Taylor took the stage to present Kanye with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. “I have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life,” Taylor said in her introduction. “I’m really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish, but Kanye has had one of the greatest careers of all time!”  She then settled in next to Kim in the audience to watch Kanye give an 11-minute speech/rant/proclamation to run for president. Their expressions throughout it all pretty much confirmed their status as #squad.  They laughed.  They applauded.They looked at one another lovingly.They hugged.And for a brief moment, Tay was basically one of the KarJenners.  https://www.instagram.com/p/7OZIdGDvFT/  After that night, Kanye sent Taylor flowers, which pretty much led to her assertion that she would, indeed, be his running mate. She captioned the Instagram photo, “Awww Kanye sent me the coolest flowers!! #KanTay2020 #BFFs.”  Interestingly enough, these flowers beared a striking resembling to his and Kim’s floral wedding wall.  💍 A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 27, 2014 at 7:58am PDT  This also resembles the flower wall Kanye got Kim for her first Mother’s Day. Basically, if Kanye loves you, you get a flower wall.  #MyWorld A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 11, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT  FEBRUARY 2016: THOSE LYRICS  Then things started to get … complicated. At Kanye’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show (which doubled as a listening party for his new album, The Life of Pablo), fans first heard his song “Famous.” In it, Kanye raps, “For all my Southside n—-s that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous / Goddamn / I made that bitch famous.”  After some reactions from the Internet (including squad members Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jaime King, plus brother Austin Swift), Kanye took to Twitter to clear up his side of the story. According to him, both Taylor and Kim approved the lyrics prior to the song’s debut.  “I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings,” Kanye wrote. He went on to say his lyrics about Taylor were “endearing” and that she herself was actually the source of a contentious line. According to him, she was at a dinner with one of their mutual friends when she allegedly said, “I can’t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!”  A spokesperson for Taylor told PEOPLE, “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account.”  Her rep also said, “She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.'”  FEBRUARY 2016: TAYLOR’S RESPONSE  The 2016 Grammys came just a few weeks later. Taylor took home the biggest prize of the night – album of the year – and used that moment to make a powerful speech that many saw as a dig to Kanye.  “[A]s the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice,” Taylor said, “I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”  She continued, “If you just focus on the work, and you don’t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you’re going, you’ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.”  JUNE 2016: KIM HAS SOME OPINIONS ON THAT  In her cover interview with GQ for their July issue, Kim said that Taylor did green-light the verse mentioning her. “She totally approved that,” she said. “She totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn’t. I swear, my husband gets so much s— for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.”  She continued: “What rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?”  Kim also shared that “so many respected people in the music business” heard the phone conversation and that West always keeps cameras rolling while he is recording an album, in case he decides to make a documentary (as one does).  “I don’t know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden,” Kim said. “It was funny because [on the call with Kanye] she said, ‘When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I’m so against this, and I’ll just laugh and say, ‘The joke’s on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.’ And I’m like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.”  Kim said Kanye and Taylor have not been in touch since the latest bout of drama, but he did receive an attorney’s letter from Taylor’s team asking for the video footage to be destroyed.  JUNE 2016: TAYLOR SEES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY  GQ reached out for comment from Taylor’s side on the whole debacle. A spokesperson for her declined to directly answer questions seeking clarification on the matter, but instead provided the following statement:  “Taylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian, as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016, and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do.”  The statement continued: “Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term ‘that bitch’ in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian’s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.”  JUNE 2016: THE MUSIC VIDEO  Kanye finally released his NSFW music video for “Famous” – and per usual, it got the people talking.  Inspired by Vincent Desiderio’s 2008 Sleep painting, Kanye literally stripped down 12 of the biggest pop culture figures, including Taylor. The video also opened with a snippet of her and background audio from that fateful night at the MTV Video Music Awards.  JULY 2016: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY  On an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family discussed the longstanding feud between Kanye and Taylor in great detail, as well as Kanye’s controversial rant during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was recorded backstage calling Taylor fake.  When Kanye’s assistant called Kim to let her know about the leaked audio recording from SNL, she got upset, though Kanye didn’t seem too bothered. “My full-time job is your publicist,” she told Kanye. “I care what people think.”  “Kanye says what he wants and he has no filter … and some people may not understand that,” Kim added during her interview. “Usually I try to stay neutral and just give moral support.”  Kim was finally ready to take action when it came to that GQ interview, and she explained to sister Kourtney Kardashian exactly why she felt the need to speak out.  “I never talk s–t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like I had so had it,” she said “I wanted to defend him in it. She legitimately quote says, ‘As soon as I get on that Grammy red carpet I’m gonna tell all the press. Like I was in on it.’ ”  “And then she just didn’t like the reaction?” Kourtney asked.  “Yeah, and you know just another way to play the victim,” Kim added. “It definitely got her a lot of attention the first time,” – referencing when Kanye jumped on VMA stage – “I just don’t think he should be punished for it still to this day,” she continued.  “I feel like I’ve had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain way and making him look a certain way, and I’m gonna say how I feel,” Kim said during her interview. “Kanye is always so honest and speaks his mind. And you know, when we were first dating, people would always talk s–t and he always had my back. At this point, I really don’t give a f— so I’ll do whatever to protect my husband.”  She then went on to add that Taylor even helped Kanye rewrite the lyrics within the song.  “I’m so glad that you said the truth,” Kourtney told Kim. “Yeah, I’m just speaking the truth,” Kim replied.  At the end of the episode, Kim sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview and issues surrounding it. Kris tried to play peacemaker, asking, “What would happen if you just called Taylor up and say ‘What happened? How did this go so south?’ I guess I don’t understand the motivation to flip … maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would to be give Taylor Swift a call.”  “Thank you for your lovely advice,” Kim told her mother, “but I’m not going to take it.”  JULY 2016: THE VIDEO FOOTAGE  Immediately following that episode of KUWTK, Kim took to Snapchat to provide the proof, sharing a series of videos of that phone call between Kanye and Taylor, discussing the “Famous” lyrics – as well as their history.  “It’s like a compliment,” Taylor is heard saying in the video after Kanye reads the lyrics to her (which include, “For all my Southside n—– that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex”).  “What I give a f— is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good,” Kanye said, and thanked Swift “for being like, so cool about it” after she told him she appreciates the “heads up” on the lyrics.  “I never would’ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song,” Taylor said. “I mean, I don’t think anybody would listen to that and be like, ‘Oh, that’s a real diss.’ You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.”  She went on to add, “If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine.”  Why might Kim do such a thing, you ask? “Kim is super loyal to Kanye and will always do anything to have his back,” a source tells PEOPLE. “She is even more protective of him than she is of herself. She thinks he’s misunderstood and couldn’t stand that people thought he was a liar.”  The Internet immediately seemed to side with Kim, and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.  JULY 2016: TAYLOR SPEAKS AGAIN  Taylor wasn’t about to sit back and watch all this happen – she quickly responded to the videos with a post on Instagram.  “Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn’t exist because it never happened. You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote in a note.  “Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.”  “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,” Taylor continued. She captioned the post, “That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.”  WATCH: Taylor Swift-Kim Kardashian Feud: Internet Sides with Kim on #KimExposedTaylorParty  JULY 2016: THE AFTERMATH  At this point, the whole situation extends far past Taylor, Kim and Kanye – the whole squad is getting involved.  Taylor’s BFF Selena Gomez tweeted, “There are more important things to talk about Why can’t people use their voice for something that f—— matters? Truth is last thing we need right now is hate, in any form.”  Chloë Grace Moretz spoke out against Kim’s actions, too, which led Kim’s sister Khloé Kardashian to clap back against her.  Then, Ruby Rose, another member of the squad, chimed in with: “Yo Khloe I thought you were rad when I met you but this is awful and this is a 19 year old girl. Nobody likes being bullied or made to feel worthless.. Yet so many people will go above and beyond to make others feel that way.”  Plenty more people weighed in – while some of Kim and Taylor’s friends stayed noticeably quiet.  JULY 2016: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS…  Aside from the drama with Kimye, Taylor hasn’t had the cleanest breakup from her ex Calvin Harris (considering he recently slammed her on Twitter and all).  The two worlds collided over the weekend during Jennifer Lopez‘s birthday celebration at her show in Las Vegas. French Montana shared an Instagram photo in which a whole group – Harris included – posed with Lopez and a cake.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BIPD1qegmiD/  Kim also shared several Snapchats during her night at Hakkasan nightclub in the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, which included dancing along and lip syncing to songs played at the club – and there’s one song in particular she chose to share with her followers.  Kim shared a video of herself and friend Carla DiBello dancing and singing along to Kanye’s now-infamous song, “Famous,” specifically at the moment where he says, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.”  JULY 2016: SELENA SPEAKS AGAIN  Selena also had a birthday to celebrate over the weekend (which Taylor, of course, observed on Instagram), but it didn’t seem quite as positive. Just before performing her hit single “Kill ‘Em With Kindness” to end a show, Selena got emotional and said to the crowd, “The next song, before I go home, is a song that’s so important to me, because I get really frustrated. I get stupid sometimes. I say things that I don’t mean, or that come out wrong, just because I care so badly.”  Selena talking to the crowd in Jakarta. pic.twitter.com/2mMqbpv1Gp — Diana (: (@gomezmalikteam) July 23, 2016  She continued her message, perhaps alluding to the recent feud Taylor has been dealing with versus Kimye, or the negative reaction from fans when she stepped in to defend her BFF. “But the thing is, at the end of the day, no war in anger was ever won,” she said, quoting her hit song. “I do know that deep down in my heart, that I have to believe that we can love each other and always be kind, no matter what it takes in us. I believe that we can do that, no matter what.”  Things took an even more emotional turn later that night when Selena posted a note on her Instagram reflecting on her performance.  “Tonight I felt extremely unauthentic, unconnected to both myself and my music. I’ve never really felt like my materials, wardrobe or a video could define me. I act on a moment and fear that something hasn’t happened. I’m stagnant, I stay still and don’t just sit with myself first and ask ‘Is this where I am, whole heartedly?’ I’ve always told the truth.

But on Instagram, Taylor asserted that Kanye never told her he was going to call her “that bitch” in the song. “You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world,” she wrote. “He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.”  Still, haters flooded Taylor’s social media pages with the reptile last summer.

       " 'First Lady Melania Trump claims there is a secret poisoner in the White House and fears her husband is being slowly poisoned with “heavy sedatives” smuggled into his drinks in an attempt to slow him down, control him, and discredit his presidency, according to reports.  While public debate rages about Donald Trump’s health, Melania has told friends and associates that the once robust and high energy man she knew and loved has been replaced with a “slower, damaged version”.  “By 8pm he is slurring,” she said. “This is not the man I know.”  Fearing that the sedatives are being pumped into the body of the POTUS via Coca-Cola that he orders by pressing a button he had installed on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Melania has insisted he stop drinking from the tap and instead revert to drinking from cans she brings herself.  “Donald’s heath improved out of sight when he stopped drinking from the tap,” Melania said.  However the First Lady fears the active campaign to poison the president is “a high level operation” and “not the work of a solitary loon.”  Melania is popular in the White House—as she is with the rest of the country—and she has befriended senior intelligence agency staff who remain loyal to president. They have educated her about Ronald Regan’s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a “brain damaged” state after years of steady poisoning.  But the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.  Donald Trump’s food choices say a lot about the man. The president’s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn’t trust those around him – and rightfully so.  As President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.  Reporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president’s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.  Pence’s meal was not unusual—he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.',\n",

       " 'Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump\\'s transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.\"The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!\" Trump tweeted Friday.The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.\"When you understand that Mexico\\'s economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,\" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN\\'s Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"On the trade negotiation side, I don\\'t think it\\'s that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it\\'s in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.\"The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they\\'d like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.\"It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that\\'s already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump\\'s campaign pledge to secure the border,\" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.Messer admitted it\\'s \"big dollars, but it\\'s a question of priorities.\" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.\"Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,\" Messer said.Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.\"We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,\" Scalise said. \"We\\'re in talks with him on the details of it as they\\'re still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there\\'s another funding bill that\\'s going to move. We\\'re going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.\"Could Mexico pay for the border wall?Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall\\'s full cost.According to Trump\\'s website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.A major challenge for judging Trump\\'s proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it\\'s difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax.Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that \"even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year.\" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump\\'s plan would likely face multiple legal battles.\"The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the \\'Radical Islamic Terrorists\\' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,\" says Callan. \"The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump\\'s use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.\"The size of Mexico\\'s remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it\\'s difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.',\n",
       " \"Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‘She’s usually so full of energy and very lively – but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,’ says a source. ‘Of course, all the baby whispers would explain why she’s not herself and seems so pale.’  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‘wonderful’, before adding Harry is ‘the best husband ever’.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

       " 'One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime\\'s take on everyone\\'s favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa\\'s wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn\\'t at Pippa\\'s wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry\\'s parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister\\'s \"no ring, no bring\" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton\\'s longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie\\'s longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton\\'s May 2017 wedding despite the \"no ring no bring\" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister\\'s wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It\\'s also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry\\'s last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn\\'t have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn\\'t the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle\\'s black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle\\'s reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn\\'t seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle\\'s relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there\\'s more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa\\'s wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.',\n",
       " 'She just gave birth 3 months ago.  Is Khloe Kardashian pregnant again? We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She’s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.  Around the time of True’s birth, Khloe’s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?  A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  It’s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she’s been trying again with Tristan?  A source has said, “Khloe loved being pregnant, but she’s the first to say how great she feels now that she’s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.”  Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, “they’ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It’s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.”  The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. “He’s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn’t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she’s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan‘s a convincing guy,” the source revealed.  Is that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.  But don’t get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she’s not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:  Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr — Khloé (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018  Keep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan.

       " 'In the latest charitable act from one of our fave celebs, singer Pink just donated half a million dollars to Harvey relief efforts. Just a few days before Justin Bieber announced his own hurricane donation, the Red Cross Los Angeles confirmed that the “What About Us” singer gave $500,000 to its charity.  On Friday, the organization shouted out Pink’s incredible gift on Twitter, expressing gratitude at the singer’s show of support towards those who have been displaced or otherwise affected by the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, which produced historic flooding in Houston and the surrounding areas when it made landfall on August 25.  \"Thank you @Pink from the bottom of our ❤️ for your donation of a half million dollars to @RedCross #HurricaneHarvey relief efforts!\" the organization tweeted.

From that point on I knew this little life depended on me to nurture and protect and I’ve been doing everything in my power to make sure my baby girl is safe and growing healthy.”  Princess Love and Ray J got married in August 2016 in Los Angeles.',\n",

It\\'s a peaceful protest.\"  Before she went into detail about her donations, the former “That 70s Show” star told Conan that she might get “a lot of hate mail” and she apologized if her actions offended anyone.  \"It\\'s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do,\" Kunis said.  \"So as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.\"  This was met with loud applause from the audience.  \"Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says, \\'an anonymous donation has been made in your name,\\'\" Kunis said.',\n",

'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'

       " \"Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis dropped a bombshell on this season of the Bravo series, when she revealed she and her castmate Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years.  So, during an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘sexy times’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob’s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.  If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.  First, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.  “Well, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,” said Shep.  The question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.  “Total? Probably like six or seven,” he revealed. “Originally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other’s booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like ‘no, no, no.'”  Andy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. “No, no,” laughed Shep, adding: “But I would go on a date with her!”  Shep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.  “Well, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn’t try anything. And I was like ‘what are you doing?’ so I was like I’ll try some things,” he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !  Finally, Shep was questioned about Thomas’s girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an “egg donor.” According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast’s drama-filled vacation.  “She was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is ‘hey, I’m really sorry about last night’ because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,” said Shep. “We were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.”  He added, “the audience doesn’t even know the half of what she actually said.”  Shep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas “would have all the support in the world if he said no thank you” to his relationship.

Cattrall’s brother Chris, 55, was found dead last week after going missing from his home in Alberta, Canada.  After announcing his death, Cattrall thanked both her fans and her Sex and the City colleagues for support.  #SexandtheCity A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 6, 2018 at 12:39pm PST  But four days after posting that message, the actor, who played Samantha on the hit HBO show, followed it up with a post directed at Parker, criticising her for “reaching out”, and saying she had been cruel.  In the caption, Cattrall said Parker’s “continual reaching out” was “a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now”.  She went on: “You are not my family. You are not my friend” and urged Parker to “stop exploiting our tragedy.”  Cattrall’s post linked to an article in the New York Post from October 2017. It described an ongoing feud between the stars which culminated with a dispute over whether to produce a third Sex and the City movie, which Cattrall said she did not want to do.

       " 'Is morning television on the brink of a major change? NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.  Though Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors -- NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn\\'t going anywhere.  \"We just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn\\'s,\" a high-level NBC source told Page Six. \"A lead anchor role at Today isn\\'t part of the conversation for Megyn. The goal was simply to get someone of Megyn\\'s talent and caliber through the door at NBC. We have not made a decision on her daytime slot. It is being discussed.\"  It was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.  Kelly, who was FOX\\'s No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O\\'Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors. Mediaite claimed that FOX had offered Kelly as much as $100 million to remain, though it seems money did not sway her final decision. She will be replaced by The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson.  Also on FORBES:  \"I have grown up here and been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for,\" she said while praising Rupert Murdoch and the FOX family.  Kelly spent 12 years with FOX, quickly climbing up the ranks and becoming a nationally recognized brand. President-elect Trump\\'s attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.  Will Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX? Will NBC push Guthrie out on Today in favor of Kelly? The answers to both questions will have far reaching impacts for their respective networks.  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save',\n",

Secondly (and more importantly), these are photos of Charlize out to dinner at Matsuhisa with her new boyfriend, Seth McFarlane. Did I jump the gun by calling Seth her boyfriend? Eh. According to sources, Seth and Charlize met in January for business-related stuff (she signed on to his planned western/spoof A Million Ways To Die In the West), then spent some social time together late in the awards season, partied together after the Oscars and now it looks like the rumors were true – they are together!  These were taken last night in West Hollywood, and Seth and Charlize came out of a sushi place. Note how Charlize is hiding her face in some of these pics? Do you think that’s just her natural reticence or is she actually shame-dating Seth and she doesn’t want people to know? My general thought on Charlize is that she would never shame-date someone. If Charlize is going to take the trouble to bang you, she doesn’t mind if people know. More likely she’s hiding her face because she just didn’t want to be photographed at that moment or whatever. And whatever she has going with Seth is barely a month old, so it is a little early to be so public, you know? You can see more photos of Seth and Charlize here.',\n",
       " 'Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think”, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.',\n",
       " 'Dawson Wade Leery is the central character from the WB television drama Dawson\\'s Creek, portrayed by James Van Der Beek, and appeared in 122 episodes and cameo in Scary Movie (2000).  Fictional biography [ edit ]  Background [ edit ]  Dawson is the first child and only son of Mitch Leery and his college sweetheart, Gail Leery. He was born on March 14, 1983. His three best friends are Joey Potter, the girl across the creek, whom he considers his soulmate, Pacey Witter, Capeside High\\'s class clown, and Jen Lindley, the new girl in town. Dawson is joined by a sister, Lily, who is born when he is 18.  Season 1 [ edit ]  An eternal optimist (at least originally), Dawson believes in the good old fashioned values of romance and honesty, and he also believes that you can find all of life\\'s answers in a Steven Spielberg film. He was a keen filmmaker and made several low cost and amateur films, which were entered into film festivals across the country, and in some festivals his films won top prize. He and long-time friend Joey Potter spend much of their time together, often sleeping in Dawson\\'s bed together. However, their relationship complicates as they age and especially with the arrival of New York exile Jen Lindley, who moves in next door to Dawson. He enters into his first relationship with her, but after her ex visits, she dumps him, insisting she needs time for herself.  After this, a series of events causes him to see lifelong friend Joey in a whole new light. First, his wise-cracking best friend Pacey Witter asks for Dawson\\'s permission to ask Joey out. Dawson responds jealously. Later, he sees Joey looking sophisticated and mature for a Beauty Pageant, which opens his eyes to her beauty. Finally, he joins Joey on a birthday visit to her father in prison and tells Mike Potter all about the daughter he doesn\\'t know. While Joey wrestles with the idea of spending a year in France, Dawson realizes that he can no longer hold back his romantic feelings towards her. The season ends with Dawson and Joey kissing in front of his bedroom window.  Season 2 [ edit ]  Although initially Dawson and Joey have smooth sailing, newcomer Jack McPhee comes to town and develops feelings for Joey, eventually kissing her. The kiss confuses Joey, who is struggling to find a passion in life. She dumps Dawson in an effort to find herself, but ends up quickly dating Jack. This sends Dawson back into the arms of Jen, who has been flirting with her old rebellious ways, and helps Dawson cut loose. All along, Dawson mopes over the loss of Joey, even making a movie recounting their breakup.  When Joey\\'s relationship with Jack crumbles due to the revelation that he is homosexual, she comes literally crying to Dawson. For his sixteenth birthday, Dawson feels depressed that he hasn\\'t grown and wasn\\'t able to keep Joey, so he gets drunk with Andie McPhee. This results in him insulting nearly all of his friends, including Pacey, of whom Dawson is envious for his newly together life. Soon Dawson and Joey end up back together. However, their reconciliation is short-lived, as Dawson soon learns that Joey\\'s father, who has gotten paroled from jail, is selling drugs again. Dawson urges Joey to wear a wire to bust her father. After this, Joey vows that she will never forgive Dawson for the position he put her in.  Season 3 [ edit ]  After a summer spent with his mom in Philadelphia, Dawson returns to Capeside still reeling from his split with Joey. On the bus ride home, he meets Eve, a mysterious, blonde femme fatale that seems intent upon luring Dawson with her sex appeal. After make out scenes in the janitor\\'s closet and in front of the entire school at a pep rally, Eve convinces Dawson to go for a ride in his dad\\'s boat. He does, but wrecks it on the way in and is told he must pay $3,000 to repair the damage to the dock he crashed into. Pacey then convinces Dawson to throw a stripper party at his parents\\' house to earn the money to pay for the dock. Although they successfully gather enough money, Mitch catches everyone leaving the house and Dawson knows he\\'s in trouble.  In the meantime, Dawson finds Eve snooping around in Grams\\'s house one night. Before he had realized that it was Eve he had called the police and it is Deputy Doug that turns up on the scene. He brushes it off afterwards, not wanting to get Eve in trouble. He later discovers an old photograph of a blonde lady in the house-boat that Eve has been living in, which he takes. Doug informs Dawson that the boat belongs to an elderly couple.  When Eve later comes for the photo he insists that Eve tell the truth. Eve reveals that she is adopted and that the woman in the picture is her biological mother and that she is searching for her. While helping Grams at her house, Dawson notices the same woman in a picture sitting on a nightstand. He asks who the woman is and Grams reveals that it\\'s her daughter, Helen, Jen\\'s mother. Dawson decides against telling Jen of his discovery. However, when Jen\\'s mother visits her mother and her daughter at Thanksgiving Dawson confronts her, pretty much forcing her to tell Jen herself.  When Dawson, Pacey and Joey join Jack and his ex-girlfriend Kate at a party hosted by Matt Caufield, the entire group, except Joey, gets drunk. Dawson, fighting to have a life separate from Joey\\'s, nearly kisses Kate. When Pacey\\'s brother, Deputy Doug busts the party after finding Pacey lying in a tree, the group all end up spending the remainder of the evening behind bars. While Dawson tells Joey that she cannot be his keeper, Jack confesses to Kate that he\\'s gay. Meanwhile, Mitch turns from friend to parent, and as a result of having to bail his son out of jail, enlists Dawson to help out at his mother\\'s new restaurant.  After meeting a rival film-maker, Dawson realizes that he has let his desire to become a director overtake his life, and he decides to give it up for a period of time. He takes down all the posters in his room, and tries to cultivate other interests. During this tumultuous time, he realizes that the only thing in his life that has ever made sense is Joey, and determines to win her back.  Little does he know, however, that Joey and Pacey have been growing closer and eventually embark on a secret romance. When he discovers their relationship, Dawson reacts with anger, and cuts Pacey out of his life. He is more determined than ever to win Joey back. Joey and Dawson go together to the Prom, but when Dawson sees Joey sharing a dance with Pacey, he is enraged and demands Joey choose. Eventually he realizes that Joey wants to be with Pacey, and gives her his blessing. She leaves him on the pier, sobbing.  Between Season 3 & 4 Pacey and Joey spend a romantic yet tame summer on his newly renovated sailboat.  Season 4 [ edit ]  Dawson discovered in the previous season that his best friend, Pacey, has feelings for Joey. After saving Pacey and Jen from a storm at sea, Dawson is forced to white wash a fence for old-time film director A.I. Brooks, as punishment for putting a hole in his boat which Dawson was forced to take to rescue Pacey and Jen. Eventually, Mr. Brooks warms to Dawson and lets him film a documentary on him when he tells Dawson that he is dying of cancer.  In the meantime, he is confronted with the idea of Pacey and Joey as a couple. While they experiment with sex during the class ski trip, Dawson must make a life-or-death decision about Mr. Brooks when he\\'s admitted to the hospital in a coma involving his terminal illness and has requested that Dawson be the one to take him off life support. Dawson chooses to let him go. When Dawson asks Joey if she slept with Pacey during the ski trip, she lies, telling him that nothing happened.  During this season, Dawson strikes up a romance with Gretchen, Pacey\\'s 21-year-old sister, who has arrived back to Capeside to take a break from college, or so everyone thinks, but she later reveals that she is there to recuperate from a miscarriage that took place during her previous semester. The baby\\'s father was her ex-boyfriend, pig-headed Nick, whom Pacey admired at first. During the Leery Christmas Party, Dawson and Gretchen share a kiss, which ignites old feelings from his pre-teen years when he had a crush on her.  After his sister Lily\\'s birth in May 2001, Dawson and Gretchen part ways and she returns to college, and he graduates from high school and heads off to USC to pursue his dream of becoming a film maker.  Season 5 [ edit ]  After graduating, he studied film at Southern California, but soon dropped out and moved to Boston to be with his friends and to be with Joey. Before Dawson can even get his parents approval for moving to Boston his father Mitch Leery is tragically killed in a car accident. This changes everything for Dawson. At first he blames himself but then he goes on to blame Joey and that puts all romantic possibilities for them out of the picture. Instead Dawson is reunited with his old girlfriend, Jen Lindley.  During their trip to the Hookset Film Festival in New Hampshire, Dawson loses his virginity to Jen. It is at this festival that Dawson wins first prize for his documentary about A.I. Brooks. There, Dawson meets Oliver Churchkirk, an aspiring film director from Boston Bay College who fancies himself the best in the business. After being asked to read his script, Dawson agrees to direct Oliver\\'s first major film. He casts Joey\\'s bubbly roommate Audrey Liddell as the female lead, and Oliver casts himself as heartbreaker, Gage. After several flubbed lines and mistakes, Dawson concludes that Oliver is not the right person for the role. He then asks Jen to bring in her cheating ex-boyfriend, Charlie Todd, to play the part. Charlie agrees when Jen tells him that he gets \"to make out with a really hot girl.\"  In the meantime, while Dawson and Oliver journey to New Jersey for a meeting with a film agent, the rest of the gang takes to the beaches of Florida for spring break; Pacey is hit on by Norwegian singer Marion Raven while working on his relationship with Audrey, while as Dawson later discovers, Joey embarks on a spring fling with Charlie Todd. Following his heart, Dawson hijacks the car with Oliver and drives down to Florida to tell Joey that he loves her. To Dawson\\'s disappointment, Pacey tells him that Joey is with Charlie.  When their film is finished, Dawson learns that Oliver set up to have the film screened by cast, crew and friends. When Dawson finally agrees, he discovers that Oliver also invited a film critic, Amy Lloyd, who writes for The Boston Weekly. Dawson, not knowing who she is, stumbles upon Amy in the midst of a nasty break-up and tells her that she is a \"sentimental drama queen with really crappy taste in movies.\" Angry, Amy leaves, unwilling to review the movie. In order to get her back to the auditorium, Dawson makes out with Amy at a local coffee shop in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from seeing her; it turns out the man she was trying to avoid was not her ex-boyfriend. After running into Amy at a movie theatre in Boston, Dawson\\'s spends the night at Amy\\'s house and the two make love. He spends the remainder of the next day with her as well.  After a misunderstanding with Joey, Dawson heads to the airport to fly to Los Angeles. Joey confronts him about the way things ended between them just days prior. The two kiss goodbye and Dawson departs for California.  Season 6 [ edit ]  After not talking all summer, Dawson has a one-night stand with Joey. The next morning Dawson receives a call from his girlfriend in L.A. leading him and Joey to fight. Dawson returns to California.  After breaking things off with Joey, Dawson reunites with Hollywood actress, Natasha; she is presumed to be a few years his senior. In the meantime, when Joey shows up to deliver food to the movie set at which Dawson works, Natasha, drunk and angry, explodes on Joey; subsequently, the director, Todd Carr, fires Dawson. Realizing she made a mistake, Natasha helps Dawson get his job back.  Dawson pays a visit to Audrey in rehab, earning her dish duty for the night, after stalking one-time film director Toni Stark. He returns to L.A. only to discover that Todd, his new mentor and friend, is in disagreements with the film company that is paying him to make the movie, \"Wicked Dead\". While Todd quickly decides to discard Natasha from the leading role, Dawson convinces him otherwise. Dawson directs the re-shoots of the movie, but even so, the movie flops, going to straight to cable TV.  After realizing they have tickets for the wrong night of a No Doubt Concert in Worcester, Natasha uses her \"assets\" to get herself and Dawson admittance into the venue. When this fails, Dawson shows off his newly-won $600, hoping someone will trade tickets with him. However, this only attracts an on-duty police officer who takes the duo to a nearby station. They are let go with a warning from the authorities.  After a few months and some white lies, Dawson assumes that Natasha is having an affair with Todd. But his worries turn out to be all for nothing when two reveal their affair is a scam, and they were simply messing with Dawson. Natasha and Dawson reunite and he brings her to Capeside for Christmas. Knowing that she cheated on him with a fellow actor (Max Winter), Dawson questions Natasha\\'s intentions, to which she becomes angry. Realizing that he\\'s not in love with Natasha, he breaks up with her, and the two part on good terms as Natasha returns to Hollywood.  Meanwhile, Dawson\\'s relationship with Pacey is better than it has been since the triangle began in the third season. Trusting Pacey to make his film savings grow, Dawson puts all the money he earned into a stock Pacey recommends. However, the stock falls through and both Dawson and Pacey are left with nothing. As a result, the two, once again, vow to no longer be friends. Joey, who is always caught in the middle, tries her best to reunite her friends. Pacey gives Dawson all the money he\\'d collected (but not all that was owed). Dawson concedes that there may be hope for the two of them.  With Audrey playing the role of Ms. Jacobs, Harley as Joey and her boyfriend Patrick as the girl-crazed 15-year-old Pacey, Dawson, with Joey\\'s and Todd\\'s help, begins filming his life story, adapted for the big screen.  Series finale [ edit ]  In 2008, Dawson is the executive producer and chief writer of the television program The Creek, a self-referential coming-of-age teen drama based on his adolescence in Capeside. While a young blonde boy portrays Dawson himself under the name \"Colby\", his two best friends appear as the neurotic \"Sam\" and heartbreaker \"Petey.\" Returning to Capeside, Dawson learns that Jen is dying. Dawson helps Jen leave a video message for her young daughter Amy, and he and Joey reconcile their past agreeing that they are meant to be best friends and nothing more.  Kevin Williamson discussed the original ending of Dawson\\'s Creek, stating the pairing was meant to be Joey and Dawson, but the two showed to be better as friends. The series ends with Dawson in his office who receives a call from Pacey and Joey, congratulating him on the season finale episode of The Creek. Dawson tells them that he\\'s going to meet with somebody tomorrow, whom Pacey and Joey are able to guess is Steven Spielberg, Dawson\\'s idol.  Notable relationships [ edit ]',\n",

       " 'Angelina Jolie is at risk of losing primary physical custody of her kids with Brad Pitt if she doesn’t take steps to improve their relationship with their father.  A judge in the couple’s ongoing divorce case said the six children “not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,” adding that “it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,” according to court documents obtained by The Blast.  The judge also ordered the “Maleficent” actress to provide her kids with cellphones that Pitt can call whenever he’d like without Jolie monitoring. She’s also not allowed to read their text messages with their father.  The court also laid out a summer schedule for each of the children except Maddox, who is old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with Pitt, the documents read.  Pitt will have custody from June 8 to June 17 for four hours per day while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house. Pitt has to designate one or two of the minor children to spend time with at a time. The “Ocean’s 13” star also has to spend time with each child at least twice during this 10-day period.  Jolie is barred from being present during or interfering with Pitt’s custodial time, the documents said.  Pitt will also have custody of his kids from July 8 through July 14, when a doctor will be required to be present and will meet with the kids before and after each two-day period. Pitt was once accused of child abuse but was ultimately cleared.  From July 21 through July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the kids when he’s back in California.  “If the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt],” the documents read.  “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children,” a spokesperson for Angelina Jolie told Page Six in a statement. “From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Related Video 1:30 Angelina Jolie went grocery shopping with the common folk',\n",
       " \"Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia Singer Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater on May 9, 2016, in Burbank, California. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  The Voice will soon be back for another season. This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show’s coaches. Gwen’s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship.  Curious about what’s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship.  1. They have recently released music about their divorces  Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images  Gwen and Blake were both recently divorced when they got together. Blake got a divorce from Miranda Lambert. And his new album, If I’m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into sadder music, a transition that reflects his personal life. “That’s when it became painfully obvious that it wasn’t going to work out in my \\xadmarriage,” he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the end of the relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the divorce.  Gwen had a messy divorce from Gavin Rossdale after she reportedly found out he cheated. She came out with a new album that includes a single titled, “Used To Love You.”  “It was really a life-saver record for me,” she told Time. “It wasn’t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, ‘God gave me a gift. I’m going to use it now. Because if I don’t, I’m going to die.'”  2. Blake’s divorce announcement on The Voice brought them closer  Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  When the two started working together they had no clue they were both going through the same thing. Then, Blake decided to announce his divorce.  “We were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake’s like, ‘I gotta talk to you guys.’ And he basically made his announcement,” Gwen told Howard Stern. “He basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn’t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible gift to be able to have a friend.”  3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  This is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren’t country music lovers. But it’s a little more surprising for someone in the industry to admit. Gwen revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, “I didn’t even know that Blake Shelton existed in the world! I had no idea.” She also had no clue what he sounded like.  He sent me this song in an email, and I was so scared because at that point I really didn’t know even what his voice really sounded like. Like, I’d heard it on the show, but I wasn’t paying attention. I was like, ‘Whatever, country guy’s on. When’s Pharrell coming on?’  4. They didn’t confirm they were dating until November 2015  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  In the beginning, there were rumors the two were dating, but they still kept it secret. Still, it was badly kept because there were photos of them getting cozy together at a Halloween party. Finally, in November, Blake’s rep confirmed they were dating to E! News.    5. Gwen and Blake are actually working like a team this season  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC  It seemed unclear whether the couple’s romantic relationship would make them more competitive with each other or whether they would work together. It looks like the latter will be happening.  “We’ll be driving home at night, and I’ll be like, ‘Do you think I should put these two people against each other?’ and he’ll be like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah,'” Gwen revealed to ET. “I was like, ‘I don’t believe you! I think you’re trying to trick me right now!'”  6. They’re reportedly being paid more because of their relationship  Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC  It’s possible The Voice might see a ratings boost from fans hoping to get a look into the couple’s relationship on the show. Because of this, they are reportedly getting paid more.  “[Blake and Gwen] are getting paid an exceptional bonus that is significantly higher than the other judges to keep the spark alive on-camera,” a production source told Radar Online. “The producers really want to see Gwen and Blake in competition more often this upcoming season, versus working with each other like they have in the past.”  7. But they do have a breakup clause in their contracts  Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC  Of course there is a risk this plan could backfire. Instead of the couple being cute on screen, they could end up breaking up and might not want to work with each other. Well, the producers have a safety net in place in case of a break-up.  “And, of course, there is a stipulation in their contract, which is more of a break-up clause,” the production source told Radar Online. “If, for some reason, they call it quits, they are both required to finish out the remainder of their existing contracts.”  8. They have reportedly already finalized their wedding plans  Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images  This couple is all in when it comes to their relationship. They reportedly have already made their wedding arrangements. “They’ve met with vendors,” a source told Us Weekly in 2016. The source also claimed they want to get married “before the end of the year.” So even though we didn’t see a 2016 wedding, one might be on the horizon.    9. It will reportedly be a $3 million Beverly Hills wedding  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People’s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images  There have been reports the couple decided to get married in Beverly Hills on May 5, 2017. According to OK! Magazine, they sent out invitations that said the ceremony would be at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Other stars, including Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, have gotten hitched there previously.  10. They are putting the wedding on hold (for now)  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani during the NFL game at the University of Phoenix Stadium | Christian Petersen/Getty Images  The celebrity couple has reportedly been making big plans for their wedding in hopes to tie the knot this year. However, it looks like those plans are on hold. According to Life & Style, they want to do one more thing first.  “They’re trying to have a baby first,” a source close to Gwen revealed. “That’s their main focus right now. She’s determined to have another baby and carry it herself, even though Blake has said it doesn’t matter if they adopt or get a surrogate.” This actually might be a challenging endeavor considering Gwen had her three kids through vitro treatments. “Physically and emotionally, it was just a lot for her,” continued the source. “So she’s trying to get pregnant naturally for the time being.”  Follow Nicole Weaver on Twitter @nikkibernice  Check out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!\",\n",

       " 'It’s been a decade since the smash hit “Mamma Mia” hit the screen, and yet director Ol Parker knew audiences still had the hunger for a sequel.  Parker, best known for writing the “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” series, was originally planning just to write the sequel, before Universal decided he would also be the right choice to direct.  With the film opening Friday, Parker talked to Variety about how Richard Curtis, the screenwriter and director of the original, played a part in pushing him towards the job, Lily James’ full commitment to the part and the famous sequel he was inspired by.  Have you been surprised at at all that there is still a thirst for a sequel even after ten years?  I’m grateful for starters. When I first got the gig I spent a couple of the first days terrified! Obviously we are here because of the enormous success of the first one, so I realized quite quickly that if I succumbed to the pressure that I would never get out of bed and would never write a word. So I just tried to view it that I got the chance to inherit these characters that people knew and loved and these songs and extraordinary music as well as these wonderful actors I get the chance to work with and not get too freaked out by the level of expectations.  When did you and Universal decide to make a flashback an essential element of how the story would be told in this sequel?  Prior to coming on, Richard Curtis wrote me an email and asked, “Random question — do you like Abba?” and I went, “Well, who doesn’t?” and that was like two years ago, and I thought he was going to invite me to dinner with them, because he knows everybody and that’s how he rolls. Then he wrote me again and asked, “How do you feel about writing the sequel to Mamma Mia?” So when I was trying to figure out the story, I reached out to Richard about how to tell the story after so many years and his brilliant daughter, Scarlet, who is also a writer and happened to be with Richard driving in a car said, “Well, you should do “Godfather 2,” and I just went “Brilliant, I’ll take it.”  I would never think to put “Godfather 2” and “Mamma Mia” together?  It is not often that they are mentioned in the same sentence — it’s not a comparison, it’s just a structural theft.  What was it about Lily James early on that made you think she could play a character that Meryl Streep had already played?  So she had met, but right after that, she went straight into doing publicity for “Baby Driver” and because it was doing so well they kept extending the publicity tour. Even though we were seeing some really great actresses, I was just waiting for Lily to come back. Lily is in life and art, completely uninhibited and just commits fully on screen.  Plus, she sang in “Cinderella” and had a lovely voice and what I didn’t realize is that while her voice was in tune and beautiful, I had no idea how well she could act with it. So she came in with like half a day in between the “Baby Driver” tour and I knew she would be brilliant but what I also came to find out was how nice she was. To me, one of the keys of casting the younger cast was casting people I really liked, because I can attest to having seen the first film and seeing that cast really unite and see that close bond they formed, I wanted that with this younger cast as well.  How did the Cher casting come about?  There’s a sports saying, if you aren’t playing offense, you’re playing defense, so if you are coming back for a sequel not be better but you have to aim higher and bring something else back in to the mix. So I wrote that part specifically for Cher in the script and when I handed it in I told them, by the way that role is Cher. I refused to contemplate anyone else being on the list. So we are waiting for a while, on Cher time — because Cher owns time. In the end, Ron Meyer just called her up and said “You’re doing ‘Mamma Mia 2” and she was like “OK.” It was a great day when she said yes but it was an even better day when the plane arrived in London. She’s also an absolute sweetheart, she’s warm and funny and was very lovely on the set.  Had you dealt with any musical directing prior to getting the job?  I hadn’t, but I was lucky enough to work with a lovely choreographer who insisted that we work together. I originally thought 40% of the film would just be his. We also had this brilliant cameraman, Bob Yeoman, and that was a really big deal when he signed . We knew we were in a different echelon with him and that was fantastic obviously. We were just having fun and no idea was too dumb.  What was your favorite musical sequence? Most challenging?  “Waterloo” was probably my favorite. That was enormous fun and we laughed a lot. Hugh was all in in that scene, we just laughed for four days. “Dancing Queen” was the hardest to pull off, all those boats and all those people dancing around the street with boats coming around the corner. Pierce, god bless him, he hurt his Achilles tendon, so he kept going, “Haven’t got too many left in me,” and then something would go wrong with a boat so we would have to apologize and he’d be like, “nope, all good.” So yeah, that was a tough one.  What do you hope audiences take away from this go-round?  It’s always hard to tell with sequels. I wrote the “Marigold Hotel” series and with the first one, people hated it in the U.K. but in America they really liked it. On the sequel, it was the direct opposite, really well-reviewed here (in the U.K.) and absolutely pissed on in the States. That taught me how much the sequel is seen through the prism of the first one and really can’t get away from that. I remember reading an interview with Meryl when the first one came out, saying “This is the type of movie the world needs.” God knows things have gotten darker since then, almost desperate times now. So if we can add any joy and lighten someone’s day then I’ll take that.  (Pictured at top: Christine Baranski and Ol Parker)',\n",
       " \"Two reality stars met in the Oval Office on Wednesday. One wanted a presidential pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother serving life in prison without parole for a drug crime. The other wanted a presidential pardon for Dinesh D’Souza, America’s greatest troll.  Guess which star became a media joke?  Kim Kardashian West met Donald Trump in the White House Wednesday to lobby for prison reform and to ask him to pardon Johnson, who went to jail more than 20 years ago after getting involved in a cocaine ring. In a viral interview, Johnson told Mic that her son had died, she’d been divorced, and she needed the money. “I couldn’t find a job fast enough to take care of my family,” she told Mic. “I felt like a failure.”  Kardashian was moved by the interview.  This is so unfair... https://t.co/W3lPINbQuy — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 26, 2017  Trump heard out Kardashian. Then he released a photo of the two of them in the Oval.

Tomorrow's cover: Kim Kardashian visits the White House to discuss prison reform with President Trump https://t.co/1N3bNkVmK7 pic.twitter.com/yPaL93Tyhe — New York Post (@nypost) May 30, 2018  It’s tempting to say that Kardashian just isn’t serious. She’s a reality star. She makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. But Trump, too, is a reality star. He, too, makes millions selling a brand on top of questionable products. The difference is that Trump is the modern male archetype. Kardashian is his female foil.  The reaction to Kardashian is a window into how we think about male and female leadership. Trump is an alpha man who never backs down, never apologizes, and never accepts “no.” He gets to be president. Kardashian is the modern female archetype — she is thin (except in the places it’s difficult to be plump), she is ageless, and she glamorizes motherhood. Her politicking is treated as a joke.  Celebrities draw attention to causes all the time — and it works. The media flocks to cover events when big names get involved in policy. Whether it’s Bono testifying on the state of AIDS resources, Brad Pitt meeting with Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi on sustainable housing, or Ashley Judd taking on saving wolves, the coverage usually takes them seriously along with the issue.  Trump’s rise is proof of the phenomenon. He was irresistible to TV news during the 2016 campaign. He still is.  But even advocates of prison reform didn’t see Kardashian, perhaps the best publicity-getter in America, as any kind of help. In a response to my colleague German Lopez’s explainer on yesterday’s meeting, Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, wrote him the following email:  President Trump’s reported meeting with Kim Kardashian West to discuss prison reform makes light of one of the biggest crises that we face in our country today. Prison reform is a complex issue that requires expertise and knowledge of where some of the greatest racial disparities lie. I am not aware that Ms. Kardashian West brings the requisite record of experience to tackle these issues on a national scale. In short, this proposed meeting is outrageous and makes clear that this administration does not deem prison reform a real priority.  Many organizations rely on celebrities to draw attention to their cause. Clarke’s organization, for example, has highlighted “special guests” at their annual gala, like Laz Alonso, a Hollywood star from box office hits like Avatar; Mike Tomlin, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers; and Jim Nantz, a CBS sports personality.  Perhaps the only person better at using celebrity for promotion than Trump is Kardashian. But when she takes up a cause, no matter how significant, her role as a feminine icon overshadows it. We laugh at the idea of the perfect woman having something important to say. But it’s not funny at all.\",\n",

       " 'Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are separating after nearly nine years of marriage.  The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE:  “Hey world!  So…We have something we would like to share.  First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it’s a consequence of the lives we’ve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We’re living in an incredible moment in time, but it’s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into “alternative facts” 😉 So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn’t read it here then it’s most certainly fiction.  We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.”  The actors, both 37, have one child together — daughter Everly — who will turn 5 in May.  The couple most recently attended the Kids’ Choice Awards together where Tatum hit the stage to promote his new animated movie Smallfoot.  They first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and began dating shortly after before tying the knot in 2009.  Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have split. The last attended a red carpet together in November (pictured) Greg Doherty/Getty  Buzz about a split began when Dewan Tatum attended the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after-party solo, but she told ET at the bash that Tatum was on daddy duty and “so happy to have a night off.”  And in mid-March the former couple shared sweet snaps from a face painting session with their daughter. “When you fall asleep around a toddler,” Dewan Tatum captioned a silly shot of Tatum before sharing a solo selfie of her own look.

Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum Channing Tatum/Instagram  In February, the actress opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a “perfect life,” saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  “When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”  Dave Benett/WireImage  Dewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along.  “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.”  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan ‘Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate’ After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  In December, Tatum wished his wife a happy birthday with a heartfelt Instagram post.  “This creature is one more year beautiful.

       " 'Sarah Rose Summers (born November 4, 1994) is an American model and beauty pageant titleholder who was crowned Miss USA 2018. As Miss USA, she will represent the United States at Miss Universe 2018. Previously, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012 and Miss Nebraska USA 2018, becoming the first woman from Nebraska to win Miss USA.  Life and career [ edit ]  Early life [ edit ]  Summers was born on November 4, 1994, in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up in Papillion in the Omaha–Council Bluffs metropolitan area.[1][2] At four years old, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).[3] She graduated from Papillion-La Vista South High School, and later earned two degrees cum laude from Texas Christian University in child development and strategic communication, with a minor in business.[4] Summers worked as a certified child life specialist prior to becoming Miss USA.[5][6][7]  Pageantry [ edit ]  Summers began her pageantry career at age ten, after she convinced her parents to allow her to compete in pageants when they received a postcard advertisement for a local child beauty pageant.[8][9] After four years of competing, Summers won the title of National American Miss Nebraska Junior Teen 2009. She went on to represent Nebraska at the national pageant and was crowned the 2009-2010 National American Miss Junior Teen.[10] In 2012, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska Teen USA 2012. She went on to represent Nebraska at Miss Teen USA 2012 at Atlantis Paradise Island in Nassau, Bahamas, but was unplaced.[11] At the end of her reign, she crowned Jasmine Fuelberth as her successor.[12] After a hiatus, Summers returned to pageantry and competed in Miss Nebraska USA 2016, where she placed as the second runner-up.  In 2018, Summers was crowned Miss Nebraska USA 2018 by Fuelberth, who was the outgoing titleholder. At Miss Nebraska USA 2018, Summers represented Omaha.[13]  Miss USA 2018 [ edit ]  After winning Miss Nebraska USA, Summers earned the right to represent Nebraska at Miss USA 2018, held at Hirsch Memorial Coliseum in Shreveport, Louisiana.[14] She went on to win the competition, becoming the first woman from Nebraska and the eleventh former Miss Teen USA contestant to win Miss USA.[15][16][17][18][4] After winning Miss USA, she crowned Bree Coffey as her Miss Nebraska USA successor.  At the national competition, co-host Vanessa Lachey asked the following: \"You are on your way to a march where someone hands you a blank sign and a marker. What do you put on your sign and why?\":  \"...I say \\'Speak your voice\\'. I don\\'t know what march we\\'re on our way to in this hypothetical situation, but no matter where you\\'re going, whatever type of march it is, you\\'re obviously on your way to that march because you care about that cause so go speak to people. When they have questions, communicate with them. Listen to their views also. That is one thing in the United States that we really need to focus on is listening to each other!...\"  involve in racist Instagram video 2018 [ edit ]  Miss USA (Sarah Summers) has been involved a racist Instagram video.The contestant is shown gossiping backstage about a couple of their non-English-speaking competitors, Miss Vietnam (H’Hen Nie) and Miss Cambodia (Rern Sinat). It starts out with Miss USA asking the other girls what they think about Miss Vietnam, with Hung and Morales describing her as “cute”. But then Miss USA starts shading Nie’s English speaking skills:“She pretends to know so much English and then you ask her a question after having a whole conversation with her and she goes [nods and smiles]” laughs Summers. While Miss Australia also let out a laugh half way through Summers’ comment, she stays quiet, perhaps unsure what to say in response. Miss USA then switches focus to Miss Cambodia, talking about how “confusing” it must be to not speak English.“Miss Cambodia is here and doesn’t speak any English, and not a single other person speaks her language. Can you imagine?” Summers continues.“Francesca said that it would be so isolating, and I said, ‘Yes’. I mean just confusing all the time.”Summers then turns to Miss Colombia to say, “you at least speak pretty good English,” before Miss Australia adds, “And you have your Spanish.” The girls then all agree it would be “really hard” with Summers concluding, “poor Cambodia”.[19].  Miss USA has apologised for making comments about her fellow Miss Universe contestants\\' English language skills, admitting what she said could have been \"perceived as not respectful\" after people described the quotes as racist. [20].    As Miss USA 2018, Summers represented the United States at Miss Universe 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, where she placed in the top twenty. The eventual winner was Catriona Gray of the Philippines.[21][22]',\n",
       " 'Jeopardy redirects here. For other uses, see Jeopardy (disambiguation)  Jeopardy! is an American television game show created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants are presented with general knowledge clues in the form of answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984.  Both NBC versions and the weekly syndicated version were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer until 1975, and John Harlan announced for the 1978–1979 show. Since its inception, the daily syndicated version has featured Alex Trebek as host and Johnny Gilbert as announcer.  With over 7,000 episodes aired,[3] the daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! has won a record 33 Daytime Emmy Awards as well as a Peabody Award. In 2013, the program was ranked No. 45 on TV Guide\\'s list of the 60 greatest shows in American television history. Jeopardy! has also gained a worldwide following with regional adaptations in many other countries. The daily syndicated series\\' 35th season premiered on September 10, 2018.[4]  Gameplay [ edit ]  Three contestants each take their place behind a lectern, with the returning champion occupying the leftmost lectern (from the viewer\\'s perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!. The material for the clues covers a wide variety of topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes before the start of the round.  First two rounds [ edit ]  Jeopardy! game board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round The layout of thegame board since November 26, 2001, showing the dollar values used in the first round  The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each of which contains five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values in the first round ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series\\' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were doubled to $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001.[8] On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.  The Jeopardy! round begins when the returning champion selects any position on the game board. The underlying clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a hand-held signaling device. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide a response to the clue, phrased in the form of a question. For example, if a contestant were to select \"Presidents for $200\", the resulting clue could be \"This \\'Father of Our Country\\' didn\\'t really chop down a cherry tree\", to which the correct response would be \"Who is/was George Washington?\" (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of \"who is/are\" for people or \"what is/are\" for things or words is almost always used.) If the contestant responds correctly, the clue\\'s dollar value is added to the contestant\\'s score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue\\'s value from the contestant\\'s score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring-in and respond. If no contestant both rings-in and responds correctly, the host gives the correct response; the \"last correct questioner\" chooses the next clue.[9]  Contestants are encouraged to select the clues in order from lowest to highest value, as the show\\'s writers write the clues in each category to flow from one to the next, as is the case with game shows that ask questions in a linear string. Contestants are not required to do so unless the category requires clues to be taken in order; the \"Forrest Bounce,\" a strategy in which contestants randomly pick clues to confuse opponents, has been used successfully by Arthur Chu and the strategy\\'s namesake Chuck Forrest, despite Trebek noting that the strategy not only annoys him but staffers as well, since it also disrupts the rhythm that develops when revealing the clues and increases the potential for error.[10]  From the premiere of the original Jeopardy! until the end of the first season of the current syndicated series, contestants were allowed to ring-in as soon as the clue was revealed. Since September 1985, contestants are required to wait until the clue is read before ringing-in. To accommodate the rule change, lights were added to the game board (unseen by home viewers) to signify when it is permissible for contestants to signal; attempting to signal before the light goes on locks the contestant out for half of a second. The change was made to allow the home audience to play along with the show more easily and to keep an extremely fast contestant from potentially dominating the game. In pre-1985 episodes, a buzzer would sound when a contestant signaled; according to Trebek, the buzzer was eliminated because it was \"distracting to the viewers\" and sometimes presented a problem when contestants rang in while Trebek was still reading the clue. Contestants who are visually impaired or blind are given a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round begins, and an audible tone is played after the clue has been read aloud.  The second round, Double Jeopardy!, features six new categories of clues. Clue values are doubled from the Jeopardy! round (except in Super Jeopardy!, where Double Jeopardy! values ranged from 500 to 2,500 points). The contestant with the least amount of money at the end of the Jeopardy! round makes the first selection in Double Jeopardy!;[9] if there is a tie, the tied contestant standing at the leftmost lectern selects first.  A \"Daily Double\" is hidden behind one clue in the Jeopardy! round, and two in Double Jeopardy! The name and inspiration were taken from a horse racing term. Only the contestant who uncovers a Daily Double may respond to that clue and need not use his/her signaling device to do so. Before the clue is revealed, the contestant must declare a wager, from a minimum of $5 to a maximum of his/her entire score (known as a \"true Daily Double\") or the highest clue value available in the round, whichever is greater.[9][14] A correct response adds the value of the wager to the contestant\\'s score, while an incorrect response deducts it. Whether or not the contestant responds correctly, he or she chooses the next clue.[9]  During the Jeopardy! round, except in response to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response in the form of a question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling.[14] If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.  Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a negative score are automatically eliminated from the game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested that it is not set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers\\' play if such a situation were ever to occur.[17] During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.  Final Jeopardy! [ edit ]  The Final Jeopardy! round features a single clue. At the end of the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category, and a commercial break follows. During the break, barriers are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager between $0 and his/her entire score. Contestants write their wagers using a light pen to write on an electronic display on their lectern. After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show\\'s iconic \"Think!\" music plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an index card and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a Braille keyboard to type in a wager and response.  Contestants\\' responses are revealed in order of their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds the amount of the contestant\\'s wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it.[9] The contestant with the highest score at the end of the round is that day\\'s winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.  The strategy for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. If the leader\\'s score is more than twice the second place contestant\\'s score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager.[19]:269 Otherwise, according to Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams, the leader will usually wager such that he or she will have a dollar more than twice the second place contestant\\'s score, guaranteeing a win with a correct response.[20] Writing about Jeopardy! wagering in the 1990s, Gilbert and Hatcher said that \"most players wager aggressively\".[19]:269  Winnings [ edit ]  The top scorer(s) in each game retain the value of their winnings in cash, and return to play in the next match. Non-winners receive consolation prizes. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant.[21] Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants\\' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.  Before 1984, all three contestants received their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed in order to make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.  Returning champions [ edit ]  The winner of each episode returns to compete against two new contestants on the next episode. Originally, a contestant who won five consecutive days retired undefeated and was guaranteed a spot in the Tournament of Champions; the five-day limit was eliminated at the beginning of season 20 on September 8, 2003.[25]  Since November 2014,[26] ties for first place following Final Jeopardy! are broken with a tie-breaker clue, resulting in only a single champion being named, keeping their winnings, and returning to compete in the next show. The tied contestants are given the single clue, and the contestant must give the correct question. A contestant cannot win by default if the opponent gives an incorrect question. That contestant must give a correct question to win the game. If neither player gives the correct question, another clue is given.[27] Previously, if two or all three contestants tied for first place, they were declared \"co-champions\", and each retained his or her winnings and (unless one was a five-time champion who retired prior to 2003) returned on the following episode. A tie occurred on the January 29, 2014, episode when Arthur Chu, leading at the end of Double Jeopardy!, wagered to tie challenger Carolyn Collins rather than winning; Chu followed Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams\\'s advice to wager for the tie to increase the leader\\'s chances of winning.[28][29] A three-way tie for first place has only occurred once on the Trebek version, on March 16, 2007, when Scott Weiss, Jamey Kirby, and Anders Martinson all ended the game with $16,000.[30] Until March 1, 2018,[26][31] no regular game had ended in a tie-breaker; numerous tournament games have ended with a tie-breaker clue.  If no contestant finishes Final Jeopardy! with a positive total, there is no winner. This has happened on several episodes,[32][33] most recently on January 18, 2016.[34] Three new contestants appear on the next episode. A triple zero has also occurred twice in tournament play (1991 Seniors and 2013 Teen), and also once in a Celebrity Week episode in 1998.[35] All consolation prize money (regular play, with one $2,000 and two $1,000 prizes, and Celebrity play, prize money for charities) are based on standard rules (score after Double Jeopardy!). In tournament play, an additional high scoring non-winner will advance to the next round (but all three players with a zero score in that game are eligible for that position should the score for that non-winner be zero; all tie-breaker rules apply).  A winner unable to return as champion because of a change in personal circumstances – for example, illness or a job offer – may be allowed to appear as a co-champion in a later episode.[36][37][38]  Typically, the two challengers participate in a backstage draw to determine lectern positions. In all situations with three new contestants (most notably tournaments in the first round), the draw will also determine who will take the champion\\'s position and select first to start the game. (The player scoring the highest in the preceding round will be given the chance to select first in the semifinal and finals.)  Variations for tournament play [ edit ]  Tournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes and feature 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. The winners of these five games, and the four highest scoring non-winners (\"wild cards\"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The winners of these three games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.  To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete.\"  If there is a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant\\'s score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card.  If two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of match (first round, semi-final game, or end of a two-game final), the standard tiebreaker is used. However, if two or more contestants tie for the highest score at the end of the first game of a two-game final, no tiebreaker is played.  If none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead.[41] This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi-finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.[41]  In the finals, contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with a $0 or negative score on either day do not play Final Jeopardy! that day; their score for that leg is recorded as $0.  Conception and development [ edit ]  In a 1964 Associated Press profile released shortly before the original Jeopardy! series premiered, Merv Griffin offered the following account of how he created the quiz show:  My wife Julann just came up with the idea one day when we were in a plane bringing us back to New York City from Duluth. I was mulling over game show ideas, when she noted that there had not been a successful \"question and answer\" game on the air since the quiz show scandals. Why not do a switch, and give the answers to the contestant and let them come up with the question? She fired a couple of answers to me: \"5,280\" – and the question of course was \"How many feet in a mile?\". Another was \"79 Wistful Vista\"; that was Fibber and Mollie McGee\\'s address. I loved the idea, went straight to NBC with the idea, and they bought it without even looking at a pilot show.[42][43]  Griffin\\'s first conception of the game used a board comprising ten categories with ten clues each, but after finding that this board could not easily be shown on camera, he reduced it to two rounds of thirty clues each, with five clues in each of six categories. He originally intended the show to require grammatically correct phrasing (e.g., only accepting \"Who is ...\" for a person), but after finding that grammatical correction slowed the game down, he decided that the show should instead accept any correct response that was in question form. Griffin discarded his initial title for the show, What\\'s the Question?, when skeptical network executive Ed Vane rejected his original concept of the game, claiming, \"It doesn\\'t have enough jeopardies.\"  Jeopardy! was not the first game show to give contestants the answers and require the questions. That format had previously been used by the Gil Fates-hosted program CBS Television Quiz, which aired from July 1941 until May 1942.  Personnel [ edit ]  Hosts and announcers [ edit ]  Art Fleming hosted the NBC and syndicated versions from 1964 to 1975, and again from 1978 to 1979. Alex Trebek has hosted the daily syndicated version since 1984.  The first three versions of the show were hosted by Art Fleming. Don Pardo served as announcer for the original NBC version and weekly syndicated version, but when NBC\\'s revival The All-New Jeopardy! launched in 1978, Pardo\\'s announcing duties were taken over by John Harlan.  Alex Trebek has served as host of the daily syndicated version since it premiered in 1984, except when he switched places with Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak as an April Fool\\'s joke on the episode aired April 1, 1997.[50] His most recent contract renewal, from May 2017, takes his tenure through the 2019–2020 season.[51] In the daily syndicated version\\'s first pilot, from 1983, Jay Stewart served as the show\\'s announcer, but Johnny Gilbert took over the role when that version was picked up as a series and has held it since then.  Trebek will be 80 at the time his contract with Jeopardy! expires in 2020. On a Fox News program, he said the odds of retirement in 2020 were 50/50 \"and a little less\". He added that he might continue if he\\'s \"not making too many mistakes\" but would make an \"intelligent decision\" as to when he should give up the emcee role.[52] In November 2018, it was announced that he had renewed his contract as host through 2022.[53]  Clue Crew [ edit ]  The Jeopardy! Clue Crew, introduced on September 24, 2001, is a team of roving correspondents who appear in videos, recorded around the world, to narrate some clues.[54] Explaining why the Clue Crew was added to the show, executive producer Harry Friedman said, \"TV is a visual medium, and the more visual we can make our clues, the more we think it will enhance the experience for the viewer.\"[55]  Following the initial announcement of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts.[55] The original Clue Crew members were Cheryl Farrell, Jimmy McGuire, Sofia Lidskog, and Sarah Whitcomb.[54] Lidskog departed the Clue Crew in 2004 to become an anchor on the high school news program Channel One News, and a search was held to replace her in early 2005.[56] The winners were Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara, who formally joined the crew starting in season 22, which premiered on September 12, 2005.[57] Farrell continued to record clues for episodes aired as late as October 2008,[58] and Cannon continued to appear until July 2009.[59]  The Clue Crew has traveled to 280 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 44 other countries. In addition to appearing in Jeopardy! clue videos, the team\\'s members also travel to meet fans of the show and future contestants. Occasionally, they visit schools to showcase the educational game Classroom Jeopardy![60] Miyahara also serves as announcer for the Sports Jeopardy! spin-off series.[61]  Production staff [ edit ]  Robert Rubin served as the producer of the original Jeopardy! series for most of its run, and later became its executive producer.[62] Following Rubin\\'s promotion, the line producer was Lynette Williams.[62]  Griffin was the daily syndicated version\\'s executive producer until his retirement in 2000. Trebek served as producer as well as host until 1987, when he began hosting NBC\\'s Classic Concentration for the next four years. At that time, he handed producer duties to George Vosburgh, who had formerly produced The All-New Jeopardy!. In the 1997–1998 season, Vosburgh was succeeded as producer by Harry Friedman, Lisa Finneran, and Rocky Schmidt. Beginning in 1999, Friedman became executive producer,[64] and Gary Johnson became the show\\'s new third producer. In the 2006–2007 season, Deb Dittmann and Brett Schneider became the producers, and Finneran, Schmidt, and Johnson were promoted to supervising producers.[62]  The original Jeopardy! series was directed at different times by Bob Hultgren, Eleanor Tarshis, and Jeff Goldstein.[62] Dick Schneider, who directed episodes of The All-New Jeopardy!, returned as director for the Trebek version\\'s first eight seasons. From 1992 to 2018, the show was directed by Kevin McCarthy, who had previously served as associate director under Schneider. McCarthy announced his retirement after 26 years on June 26, 2018, and was succeeded as director by Clay Jacobsen.[65]  The current version of Jeopardy! employs nine writers and five researchers to create and assemble the categories and clues.[66] Billy Wisse and Michele Loud, both longtime staff members, are the editorial producer and editorial supervisor, respectively.[67] Previous writing and editorial supervisors have included Jules Minton, Terrence McDonnell, Harry Eisenberg, and Gary Johnson.[62]  The show\\'s production designer is Naomi Slodki.[67] Previous art directors have included Henry Lickel, Dennis Roof, Bob Rang,[62] and Ed Flesh (who also designed sets for other game shows such as The $25,000 Pyramid, Name That Tune, and Wheel of Fortune).[69]  Production [ edit ]  The daily syndicated version of Jeopardy! is produced by Sony Pictures Television (previously known as Columbia TriStar Television, the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises).[70] The copyright holder is Jeopardy Productions, which, like SPT, operates as a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment.[71] The rights to distribute the program worldwide are owned by CBS Television Distribution, which absorbed original distributor King World Productions in 2007.[72]  The original Jeopardy! series was taped in Studio 6A at NBC Studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City,[73] and The All-New Jeopardy! was taped in Studio 3 at NBC\\'s Burbank Studios at 3000 West Alameda Avenue in Burbank, California. The Trebek version was initially taped at Metromedia Stage 7, KTTV, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, but moved its production facilities to Hollywood Center Studios\\' Stage 9 in 1985. After the final shows of season 10 were recorded on February 15, 1994, the Jeopardy! production facilities were moved to Sony Pictures Studios\\' Stage 10 on Washington Boulevard in Culver City, California, where the show has been recorded ever since.  Five episodes are taped each day, with two days of taping every other week.[74]  Set [ edit ]  Various sets used by the syndicated version over the years. From top to bottom: 1984–85, 1985–91, 1991–96, 1996–2002, 2002–09, and 2009–13.  Various technological and aesthetic changes have been made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!\\'s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and the clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall,[76] which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.[77]  From 1985 to 1997, the sets were designed to have a background color of blue for the Jeopardy! round and red for the Double Jeopardy! and Final Jeopardy! rounds. At the beginning of season 8 in 1991, a brand new set was introduced that resembled a grid. On the episode aired November 11, 1996, two months after the start of season 13, Jeopardy! introduced the first of several sets designed by Naomi Slodki, who intended the set to resemble \"the foyer of a very contemporary library, with wood and sandblasted glass and blue granite\".  Shortly after the start of season 19 in 2002, the show switched to yet another new set, which was given slight modifications when Jeopardy! and sister show Wheel of Fortune transitioned to high-definition broadcasting in 2006.[76] During this time, the show began to feature virtual tours of the set on its official web site.[80] The various HD improvements for Jeopardy! and Wheel represented a combined investment of approximately $4 million, 5,000 hours of labor, and 6 miles (9.7 km) of cable.[76] Both shows had been shot using HD cameras for several years before beginning to broadcast in HD. On standard-definition television broadcasts, the shows continue to be displayed with an aspect ratio of 4:3.  In 2009, Jeopardy! updated its set once again. The new set debuted with special episodes taped at the 42nd annual International CES technology trade show, hosted at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester (Las Vegas Valley), Nevada, and became the primary set for Jeopardy! when the show began taping its 26th season, which premiered on September 14, 2009.[77] It was significantly remodeled when season 30 premiered in September 2013.[81]  Theme music [ edit ]  Since the debut of Jeopardy! in 1964, several different songs and arrangements have served as the theme music for the show, most of which were composed by Griffin. The main theme for the original Jeopardy! series was \"Take Ten\",[82] composed by Griffin\\'s wife Julann.[83] The All-New Jeopardy! opened with \"January, February, March\" and closed with \"Frisco Disco\", both of which were composed by Griffin himself.[84]  The best-known theme song on Jeopardy! is \"Think!\", originally composed by Griffin under the title \"A Time for Tony\", as a lullaby for his son.[85] \"Think!\" has always been used for the 30-second period in Final Jeopardy! when the contestants write down their responses, and since the syndicated version debuted in 1984, a rendition of that tune has been used as the main theme song. \"Think!\" has become so popular that it has been used in many different contexts, from sporting events to weddings. Griffin estimated that the use of \"Think!\" had earned him royalties of over $70 million throughout his lifetime.[88] \"Think!\" led Griffin to win the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President\\'s Award in 2003,[89] and during GSN\\'s 2009 Game Show Awards special, it was named \"Best Game Show Theme Song\".[90] In 1997, the main theme and Final Jeopardy! recordings of \"Think!\" were rearranged by Steve Kaplan, who served as the show\\'s music director until his December 2003 death.[91] In 2008, Chris Bell Music and Sound Design overhauled the Jeopardy! music package for the show\\'s 25th anniversary.[92]  Audition process [ edit ]  Prospective contestants of the original Jeopardy! series called the show\\'s office in New York to arrange an appointment and to preliminarily determine eligibility. They were briefed and auditioned together in groups of ten to thirty individuals, participating in both a written test and mock games. Individuals who were successful at the audition were invited to appear on the program within approximately six weeks.  Auditioning for the current version of the show begins with a written exam, comprising fifty questions in total. This exam is administered online periodically, as well as being offered at regional contestant search events. Since season 15 (1998–99), the show has used a Winnebago recreational vehicle called the \"Jeopardy! Brain Bus\" to conduct regional events throughout the United States and Canada. Participants who correctly answer at least 35 out of 50 questions advance in the audition process and are invited to compete in mock games. Those who are approved are notified at a later time and invited to appear on the show.  Broadcast history [ edit ]  The original Jeopardy! series premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964, and by the end of the 1960s was the second-highest-rated daytime game show, behind only The Hollywood Squares. The show was successful until 1974, when Lin Bolen, then NBC\\'s Vice President of Daytime Programming, moved the show out of the noontime slot where it had been located for most of its run, as part of her effort to boost ratings among the 18–34 female demographic. After 2,753 episodes, the original Jeopardy! series ended on January 3, 1975; to compensate Griffin for its cancellation, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another show that he had created, and premiered it the following Monday. A syndicated edition of Jeopardy!, distributed by Metromedia and featuring many contestants who were previously champions on the original series, aired in the primetime during the 1974–1975 season. The NBC daytime series was later revived as The All-New Jeopardy!, which premiered on October 2, 1978[98] and aired 108 episodes, ending on March 2, 1979;[99] this revival featured significant rule changes, such as progressive elimination of contestants over the course of the main game, and a bonus round instead of Final Jeopardy!  The daily syndicated version debuted on September 10, 1984, and was launched in response to the success of the syndicated version of Wheel and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars. This version of the program has met with greater success than the previous incarnations; it has outlived 300 other game shows and become the second most popular game show in syndication (behind Wheel), averaging 25 million viewers per week. The show\\'s most recent renewal, in May 2017, extends it through the 2019–2020 season.[51]  Jeopardy! listed in yellow (the common Arabic-language version in light yellow) Countries with versions oflisted in yellow (the common Arabic-language version in light yellow)  Jeopardy! has spawned versions in many foreign countries throughout the world, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Israel, and Australia. The American syndicated version of Jeopardy! is also broadcast throughout the world, with international distribution rights handled by CBS Studios International.[104]  Three spin-off versions of Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998 and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst. Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998–1999 season, was a special children\\'s version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the original version. Sports Jeopardy!, a sports-themed version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service and eventually moved to the cable sports network NBCSN in 2016.[107]  Archived episodes [ edit ]  Only a small number of episodes of the first three Jeopardy! versions survive. From the original NBC daytime version, archived episodes mostly consist of black-and-white kinescopes of the original color videotapes. Various episodes from 1967, 1971, 1973, and 1974 are listed among the holdings of the UCLA Film and Television Archive.[109] The 1964 \"test episode\", Episode No. 2,000 (from February 21, 1972), and a June 1975 episode of the weekly syndicated edition exist at the Paley Center for Media.[110] Incomplete paper records of the NBC-era games exist on microfilm at the Library of Congress. GSN holds The All-New Jeopardy!\\'s premiere and finale in broadcast quality, and aired the latter on December 31, 1999, as part of its \"Y2Play\" marathon.[99] The UCLA Archive holds a copy of a pilot taped for CBS in 1977,[109] and the premiere exists among the Paley Center\\'s holdings.[110]  GSN, which, like Jeopardy!, is an affiliate of Sony Pictures Television, has rerun ten seasons since the channel\\'s launch in 1994. Copies of 43 Trebek-hosted syndicated Jeopardy! episodes aired between 1989 and 2004 have been collected by the UCLA Archive,[109] and the premiere and various other episodes are included in the Paley Center\\'s collection.[110]  Reception [ edit ]  Alex Trebek with the Peabody Award, 2012  By 1994 the press called Jeopardy! \"an American icon\".[111] It has won a record 33 Daytime Emmy Awards since 1984.[112] The show holds the record for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show, with fifteen awards won in that category.[66] Another five awards have been won by Trebek for Outstanding Game Show Host.[66] Twelve other awards were won by the show\\'s directors and writers in the respective categories of Outstanding Direction for a Game/Audience Participation Show and Outstanding Special Class Writing before these categories were removed in 2006. On June 17, 2011, Trebek shared the Lifetime Achievement Award with Sajak at the 38th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony.[113] The following year, the show was honored with a Peabody Award for its role in encouraging, celebrating, and rewarding knowledge.[114]  In its April 17–23, 1993 issue, TV Guide named Jeopardy! the best game show of the 1970s as part of a celebration of its 40th anniversary.[115] In January 2001, the magazine ranked the show number 2 on its \"50 Greatest Game Shows\" list—second only to The Price Is Right.[116] It would later rank Jeopardy! number 45 on its list of the 60 Best TV Series of All Time, calling it \"habit-forming\" and saying that the program \"always makes [its viewers] feel smarter\".[117] Also in 2013, the show ranked number 1 on TV Guide\\'s list of the 60 Greatest Game Shows.[118] In the summer of 2006, the show was ranked number 2 on GSN\\'s list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, second only to Match Game.[119]  A hall of fame honoring Jeopardy! was added to the Sony Pictures Studios tour on September 20, 2011. It features the show\\'s Emmy Awards as well as retired set pieces, classic merchandise, video clips, photographs, and other memorabilia related to Jeopardy!\\'s history.[120]  In 1989, Fleming expressed dissatisfaction with the daily syndicated Jeopardy! series in an essay published in Sports Illustrated. He confessed that he only watched the Trebek version infrequently, and then only for a handful of questions; and also criticized this new iteration mainly for its Hollywood setting. Fleming believed that, in contrast to New Yorkers who Fleming considered to be more intelligent and authentic, moving the show to Hollywood brought both an unrealistic glamour and a dumbing-down of the program that he disdained. He also disliked the decision to not award losing contestants their cash earnings (believing the parting gifts offered instead to be cheap) and expressed surprise that what he considered to be a parlor game had transformed into such a national phenomenon under Trebek.[121]  Jeopardy!\\'s answer-and-question format has become widely entrenched: Fleming observed that other game shows would have contestants phrasing their answers in question form, leading hosts to remind them that they are not competing on Jeopardy!  Tournaments and other events [ edit ]  Regular events [ edit ]  Starting in 1985, the show has held an annual Tournament of Champions featuring the top fifteen champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. The top prize awarded to the winner was originally valued at $100,000, and increased to $250,000 in 2003.[123] Other regular tournaments include the Teen Tournament, with a $100,000 top prize;[104] the College Championship, in which undergraduate students from American colleges and universities compete for a $100,000 top prize; and the Teachers Tournament, where educators compete for a $100,000 top prize.[124] Each tournament runs for ten consecutive episodes in a format devised by Trebek himself, consisting of five quarter-final games, three semifinals, and a final consisting of two games with the scores totaled. Winners of the College Championship and Teachers Tournament are invited to participate in the Tournament of Champions.  Non-tournament events held regularly on the show include Celebrity Jeopardy!, in which celebrities and other notable individuals compete for charitable organizations of their choice; and Kids Week, a special competition for school-age children aged 10 through 12.[126]  Special events [ edit ]  Three International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, featured one-week competitions among champions from each of the international versions of Jeopardy!. Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of other Jeopardy! tournaments. In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000; in 2001, the top prize was doubled to $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of Jeopardy!, and is significant for being the first week of Jeopardy! episodes to be taped in a foreign country.  There have been a number of special tournaments featuring the greatest contestants in Jeopardy! history. The first of these \"all-time best\" tournaments, Super Jeopardy!, aired in the summer of 1990 on ABC, and featured 35 top contestants from the previous seasons of the Trebek version and one notable champion from the original Jeopardy! series competing for a top prize of $250,000. In 1993, that year\\'s Tournament of Champions was followed by a Tenth Anniversary Tournament conducted over five episodes. In May 2002, to commemorate the Trebek version\\'s 4,000th episode, the show invited fifteen champions to play for a $1 million prize in the Million Dollar Masters tournament, which took place at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The Ultimate Tournament of Champions aired in 2005 and pitted 145 former Jeopardy! champions against each other, with two winners moving on to face Ken Jennings in a three-game final for $2,000,000, the largest prize in the show\\'s history; overall, the tournament spanned 15 weeks and 76 episodes, starting on February 9 and ending on May 25.[129] In 2014, Jeopardy! commemorated the 30th anniversary of the Trebek version with a Battle of the Decades tournament, in which 15 champions apiece from the first, second, and third decades of Jeopardy!\\'s daily syndicated history competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000.[130]  In November 1998, Jeopardy! traveled to Boston to reassemble 12 past Teen Tournament contestants for a special Teen Reunion Tournament. In 2008, the 25th season began with reuniting 15 contestants from the first two Kids Weeks to compete in a special reunion tournament of their own.[131] During the next season (2009–2010), a special edition of Celebrity Jeopardy!, called the Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational, was played in which twenty-seven contestants from past celebrity episodes competed for a grand prize of $1,000,000 for charity; the grand prize was won by Michael McKean.[132]  The IBM Challenge aired February 14–16, 2011, and featured IBM\\'s Watson computer facing off against Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a two-game match played over three shows.[133] This was the first man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!\\'s history.[134] Watson won both the first game and the overall match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid).[135] Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their winnings to charity.[136] The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.[137]  Record holders [ edit ]  Jeopardy!\\'s record for the longest winning streak is held by Ken Jennings, who competed on the show from June 2 through November 30, 2004, winning 74 matches before being defeated by Nancy Zerg in his 75th appearance. He amassed $2,520,700 over his 74 wins and a $2,000 second-place prize in his 75th appearance. At the time, he held the record as the highest money-winner ever on American game shows, and his winning streak increased the show\\'s ratings and popularity to the point where it became TV\\'s highest-rated syndicated program.[138] Jennings later won the $500,000 second-place prize in the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions, the $300,000 second-place prize in the IBM Challenge, and the $100,000 second-place prize in the Battle of the Decades.  The highest-earning all-time Jeopardy! contestant is Brad Rutter, who has won a cumulative total of $4,355,102.[139] He became an undefeated champion in 2000 and later won an unprecedented four Jeopardy! tournaments: the 2001 Tournament of Champions,[140] the 2002 Million Dollar Masters Tournament, the 2005 Ultimate Tournament of Champions,[141] and the 2014 Battle of the Decades. Rutter broke Jennings\\'s record for all-time game show winnings when he defeated Jennings and Jerome Vered in the Ultimate Tournament of Champions finals. Jennings regained the record through appearances on various other game shows, culminating in an appearance on Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? on October 10, 2008. In 2014, Rutter regained the title after winning $1,000,000 in the Battle of the Decades, defeating Jennings and Roger Craig in the finals.  Craig is the holder of the all-time record for single-day winnings on Jeopardy!. On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game\\'s first two rounds, then wagered and won an additional $30,000 in the Final Jeopardy! round, finishing with $77,000. The previous single-day record of $75,000 had been set by Jennings.[142]  The record-holder among female contestants on Jeopardy!—in both number of games and total winnings—is Julia Collins, who amassed $429,100 over 21 games between April 21 and June 2, 2014. She won $428,100 in her 20 games as champion, plus $1,000 for finishing third in her twenty-first game.[143] Collins also achieved the second-longest winning streak on the show, behind Jennings. The streak, which was interrupted in May by the Battle of the Decades, was broken by Brian Loughnane.[144][145]  The highest single-day winnings in a Celebrity Jeopardy! tournament was achieved by comedian Andy Richter during a first-round game of the 2009–2010 season\\'s \"Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational\", in which he finished with $68,000 for his selected charity, the St. Jude Children\\'s Research Hospital.[146]  Four contestants on the Trebek version have won a game with the lowest amount possible ($1). The first was U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Darryl Scott, on the episode that aired January 19, 1993;[147][148] the second was Benjamin Salisbury, on a Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired April 30, 1997;[149] the third was Brandi Chastain, on the Celebrity Jeopardy! episode that aired February 9, 2001;[150] and the fourth was U.S. Navy Lieutenant Manny Abell, on the episode that aired October 17, 2017.[148]  Other media [ edit ]  Portrayals and parodies [ edit ]  Jeopardy! has been featured in a number of films, television shows and books over the years, mostly with one or more characters participating as contestants, or viewing and interacting with the game show from their own homes.  Merchandise [ edit ]  Over the years, the Jeopardy! brand has been licensed for various products. From 1964 through 1976, Milton Bradley issued annual board games based on the original Fleming version. The Trebek version has been adapted into board games released by Pressman Toy Corporation, Tyco Toys, and Parker Brothers.[165] In addition, Jeopardy! has been adapted into a number of video games released on various consoles and handhelds spanning multiple hardware generations, starting with a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987.[166] The show has also been adapted for personal computers (starting in 1987 with Apple II, Commodore 64, and DOS versions[167]), Facebook,[168] Twitter, Android, and the Roku Channel Store.[169]  A DVD titled Jeopardy!: An Inside Look at America\\'s Favorite Quiz Show, released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on November 8, 2005, features five memorable episodes of the Trebek version (the 1984 premiere, Jennings\\' final game, and the three finals matches of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions)[170] and three featurettes discussing the show\\'s history and question selection process.[171] Other products featuring the Jeopardy! brand include a collectible watch, a series of daily desktop calendars, and various slot machine games for casinos and the Internet.  Internet [ edit ]  Jeopardy!\\'s official website, active as early as 1998,[172] receives over 400,000 monthly visitors. The website features videos, photographs, and other information related to each week\\'s contestants, as well as mini-sites promoting remote tapings and special tournaments. As the show changes its main title card and corresponding graphics with every passing season, the Jeopardy! website is re-skinned to reflect the changes, and the general content of the site (such as online tests and promotions, programming announcements, \"spotlight\" segments, photo galleries, and downloadable content) is regularly updated to align with producers\\' priorities for the show.[174] In its 2012 \"Readers Choice Awards\", About.com praised the official Jeopardy! website for featuring \"everything [visitors] need to know about the show, as well as some fun interactive elements\", and for having a humorous error page.[175]  In November 2009, Jeopardy! launched a viewer loyalty program called the \"Jeopardy! Premier Club\", which allowed home viewers to identify Final Jeopardy! categories from episodes for a chance to earn points, and play a weekly Jeopardy! game featuring categories and clues from the previous week\\'s episodes. Every three months, contestants were selected randomly to advance to one of three quarterly online tournaments; after these tournaments were played, the three highest scoring contestants would play one final online tournament for the chance to win $5,000 and a trip to Los Angeles to attend a taping of Jeopardy![176] The Premier Club was discontinued by July 2011.[177]  There is an unofficial Jeopardy! fansite known as the \"J! Archive\" (j-archive.com), which transcribes games from throughout Jeopardy!\\'s daily syndicated history. In the archive, episodes are covered by Jeopardy!-style game boards with panels which, when hovered over with a mouse, reveal the correct response to their corresponding clues and the contestant who gave the correct response. The site makes use of a \"wagering calculator\" that helps potential contestants determine what amount is safest to bet during Final Jeopardy!, and an alternative scoring method called \"Coryat scoring\" that disregards wagering during Daily Doubles or Final Jeopardy! and gauges one\\'s general strength at the game. The site\\'s main founding archivist is Robert Knecht Schmidt, a student from Cleveland, Ohio,[178] who himself appeared as a Jeopardy! contestant in March 2010.[179] Before J! Archive, there was an earlier Jeopardy! fansite known as the \"Jeoparchive\", created by season 19 contestant Ronnie O\\'Rourke, who managed and updated the site until Jennings\\'s run made her disillusioned with the show.[178]  References [ edit ]',\n",

That is, if they even have one anymore.  To jog your memory, Khloé just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan’s alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khloé’s side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it’s been like ever since.

In Kim’s interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, \"Like, I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so f*cked up.\" Indeed it is, Kim.  And in the full interview clip, Kim said Khloé is taking some time for herself and True and isn\\'t making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan\\'s relationship.  According to Kim, Khloé is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.  \"You know, I think she’s not thinking of anything,\" Kim said. \"I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family’s flown out there a few times.\"  She went on to say, \"I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].\"  Kim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khloé.  \"We really were rooting for Khloé, and we still are.

       " \"And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

       " '299 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Suicide Squad star Joel Kinnaman learned the hard way that you probably shouldn\\'t allow a co-worker to give you a tattoo.  RELATED: Suicide Squad 2 Will Likely Be \"More Grounded\"  The actor recently appeared on Bravo\\'s Watch What Happens Live, where he revealed how much he regrets letting his Suicide Squad co-star Will Smith loose with a tattoo gun. The cast of the 2016 Warner Bros. film famously (or perhaps infamously) got matching \"SKWAD\" tattoos to commemorate their work together. But now Kinnaman thinks that may have been a bad idea.  Kinnaman was all smiles in a 2015 photo that captured Smith at work (although in the caption, the actor acknowledged, \"Will has many many talents, tattooing is not one of them\"). But when asked on Watch What Happens Live, he acknowledged he regretted the tattoo: \"The answer is yes. Absolutely. That was a horrible idea.\"  \"You know, don\\'t let a 47-year-old man without his reading glasses tattoo you,\" Kinnaman added \"That is the life lesson.\"  Despite that regret, he admitted he received exactly what he asked for in the end. \"It\\'s supposed to be a shitty tattoo,\" he said, \"so that\\'s what it is.\"  Suicide Squad 2 is expected to see return Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as The Joker and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. No release date has been announced, but the film is believed to begin production this fall.  (via MTV)  Venom Producer Identifies the Scene Where the Film Clicked',\n",
       " 'Celebrity conspiracy theories: Kate Middleton\\'s \\'surrogate pregnancy\\' to Marilyn Monroe\\'s overdose by Kayleigh Dray | 07 04 2016 Celebrity conspiracy theories © WENN / REX / YOUTUBE Conspiracy theorists, rejoice!  From Beyonce\\'s fake baby bump to Marilyn Monroe\\'s murder, we\\'ve taken a look back over the most enduring celebrity conspiracy theories of all time. Read on for more...  Kate Middleton did NOT give birth to a baby girl  Yeah, you read that right; some people out there have convinced themselves that the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Princess Charlotte via a surrogate mother.  Why? Well, for no real reason other than the fact that she looked so good when she appeared outside the Lindo Wing of London\\'s St Mary\\'s Hospital with Princess Charlotte on 2nd May 2015.  One conspiracy theorist, who was quoted in a Russian newspaper, said: “It was a surrogate mother who gave birth but not her. Kate must have been wearing a fake belly showing to the people that she was pregnant. Another added to the Komsomolskaya Pravda: “She did not give birth, I am sure. There is no special maternal look in her eyes - this natural thing is not visible.”  This theory is, quite obviously, nonsense; the Duchess of Cambridge was just lucky enough to have a team of stylists on hand after Princess Charlotte’s arrival – hence the amazing hair, makeup, and coordinating mother-and-baby ensemble.  And the thing about the eyes? Utterly bizarre; all you need to do is look at Kate to see just how much she loves her little girl.  Beyonce is actually Solange\\'s mum  Apparently Beyoncé wasn’t actually born in 1981; yup, someone who claims to work for the Department of Health in Texas supposedly unearthed her birth certificate and claims it has her birth date as 1974.  Gabrielle Union, who was born in 1972, also famously said that she and Queen B were BFFs when they were teenagers - again suggesting that she\\'s a tad older than she says she is.  Cue people claiming that Beyonce got pregnant at around 12 or 13-years-old, had a baby girl, and her family covered it up by pretending Solange was actually Matthew and Tina\\'s daughter.  COULD IT BE?!?!  Probably not; it sounds too much like an EastEnders storyline to us. Also, y\\'know, there are pictures and videos of them together as children. Children who are THE SAME AGE.  Nicolas Cage is a vampire  There\\'s a photo of a man from the Civil War circulating the interweb, and, yes, it looks a lot like Nicolas Cage.  This has led people to claim that (it pains us to write this) the actor is, in fact, a vampire - and he reinvents himself every 75 years or so. facepalm  Brittany Murphy was murdered by the government  Brittany Murphy died on 20th December 2009 at the age of 32 after suffering a reported cardiac arrest. At the time of her death, the Los Angeles coroner said he believed the cause of death \"appears to be natural\", later stating that it was an accident spurred by medications she was taking to combat pneumonia and an iron deficiency.  But, when her husband, Simon Monjack, died five months later, in similar circumstances to Brittany, her father grew suspicious. Angelo Betolotti obtained hair, blood and tissue samples for independent testing - and they have reportedly revealed the presence of ten separate heavy metals in Brittany\\'s system.  At the time of her death, Brittany reportedly displayed all the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, including headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia.  In a recent interview with Fleur De Lis Film Studios, Brittany\\'s father claimed that his daughter was under surveillance after speaking out in support of Julia Davis, a government whistleblower: \"They were, in fact, under surveillance, including helicopters. Their telephones were wiretapped.  “Vicious rumours, spread by tabloids, unfairly smeared Brittany’s reputation. My daughter was neither anorexic nor a drug junkie, as they repeatedly implied. \"Brittany and Simon were ridiculed […] when they complained of being under surveillance and in fear for their lives. I will not rest until the truth about these tragic events is told. There will be justice for Brittany.”  Do you think there is more to her death than meets the eye?  Tom Cruise hired Katie Holmes to be his wife  As far-fetched as it sounds, plenty of people out there believe that Tom Cruise approached several young Hollywood stars (including Scarlett Johansson) with an offer of a five-year marriage contract.  In exchange for marrying Cruise, the bride would receive a career boost and cash, plus a bonus if she gave birth to a child. For Tom, the marriage would provide him with a child, rehabilitate his increasingly eccentric public image, and finally quash all of those pesky gay rumors.  However sources close to the couple (whom are now divorced) have poured water on the rumours, insisting Cruise was \"completely in love with Katie\".  Plus there\\'s the fact that Katie demanded sole custody of daughter Suri in her divorce filing; surely any pre-existing contract between her and Cruise would have prevented her from doing any such thing?  James Hewitt is Prince Harry\\'s real dad  Hmm. Basically, James Hewitt claimed he had an affair with Princess Diana from 1986 - 1991, and, as he looks a lot like Harry, a lot of people have said he MUST be the prince\\'s real dad.  Harry, being the jokester he is, has never taken the reports seriously - and has even cracked a joke about it. During a visit to Bacon’s College in South East London with William and Kate in July 2012, a young boy shouted across the football field to Wills: “Are you two brothers?”  Quick-witted Harry instantly replied: “We’re not sure.” Oh Hazzer, we love you so.  Marilyn Monroe was murdered  Marilyn Monroe\\'s death remains a mystery, even today, although there is a LOT of evidence to suggest that she was murdered. And we don\\'t say things like that lightly...  While empty pill bottles were found in her room, the room contained no means to wash the pills down (there was no glass and the water was turned off). T  he pathologist, Dr. Thomas Noguchi, could find no trace of capsules, powder or the typical discolouration caused by Nembutal in Monroe\\'s stomach or intestines, indicating that the drugs that killed her had not been swallowed. T  he time of death and witness statements do not match up, phone records have suspiciously gone missing and police claim that Marilyn\\'s housekeeper had changed the sheets - was even washing sheets - when they arrived.  But if it wasn\\'t suicide, who killed her?  In October 2006, under the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released thousands of classified documents, including a three-page report about Marilyn Monroe.  It detailed Marilyn\\'s affairs with John F. Kennedy, claiming that he had promised to divorce his wife and marry her. But, when Marilyn found out he had no intention of doing so, she threatened to go public with their affair. W  hen you add the contents of this file to the MANY discrepancies in the evidence surrounding Marilyn\\'s death, you can see why so many conspiracy theorists are adamant that Marilyn was murdered.  Khloe Kardashian\\'s dad is OJ Simpson  Khloe Kardashian\\'s stepmother famously claimed that the reality star is not Robert Kardashian\\'s biological daughter.  And, in 2013, OJ Simpson\\'s manager has added fuel to the flames, stating that Khloe \"could be OJ\\'s kid\".  \"It\\'s all going to come out sooner or later,\" Norman Pardo told In Touch Weekly in a new interview about her paternity.  OJ, who’s currently serving a 9-to 33-year sentence in a Nevada prison for kidnapping and armed robbery, hasn\\'t denied that Khloé could be his daughter. “Whenever I bring it up, he giggles.”  Kris and O.J. were close friends before Robert, an attorney, successfully defended the NFL star against charges he’d murdered his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, who was also one of Kris’ dearest friends.  “They all took their vacations together. There was a lot of partying going on back then.\"  We doubt Khloe will be too perturbed by the claims.  In fact, she resisted having a DNA test last year, telling Kris Jenner in her typically blunt and hilarious manner: “My dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner. \"If you f**ked other people during the same time, and you do not know, go on Maury. Like, I don’t care!”  Pippa Middleton wore a fake bum to the royal wedding  It\\'s not so much a hit below the belt as it is a hit below the skirt, is it?  Yup, Mr Bern, a Knight of the Order of Grimaldi in Monaco and an expert on etiquette, claimed last year that the bum which enchanted the world was, in fact, a false.  He said: “But of course she had a false bottom. I repeat it,she had a false bottom. “You take her away from that and she has normal buttocks. It was an optical illusion.  “She knew there were a billion people watching. It was the moment to show it.”  Sounds a pretty bum theory to us - Pippa\\'s shapely derriere couldn\\'t possibly have been faked!  Michael Jackson was chemically castrated  Michael Jackson had a truly amazing voice - but some have claimed that his ability to reach those high notes was all down to chemical castration.  Alain Branchereau, a professor of vascular surgery, insisted that MJ used the synthetic anti-male hormone drug Cyproterone as a cure for his acne.  He said: \"When he was 12, Michael Jackson had acne. We know this, he spoke about it himself as a tragedy.  \"What I think could have happened is that his people suggested this miracle treatment.\"  He explained that the drug \"blocks puberty, the voice can\\'t mature,\" stops bodily hair and the larynx from growing, and affects the bones, leaving the body with a slight frame and a large chest. When the treatment is finished, the patient \"keeps a child\\'s larynx all his life in a man\\'s body.\"  We will never have proof as to whether or not this is true, but the rumour makes us feel desperately sad.  Paul McCartney died in a car crash- and was replaced by a lookalike  Yeah, you heard us.  A lot of obsessive Beatles fans are CONVINCED that Sir Paul is an impostor and that the real deal was decapitated and burnt to a crisp in a car crash.  Hmm.  Because of all the buckets of money the Beatles contributed to England\\'s tax coffers, their continued success was vital to the financial health of the nation. So the British government, in cahoots with the surviving members of the Beatles, conspired to cover-up Paul\\'s death.  Apparently the evidence we need to believe this theory can be found on the cover of the Beatles\\' last album, Abbey Road.  Which was, apparently, a way for the other Beatles to confess and alleviate their guilt over the whole body swap thing. The image shows the fab four crossing the road, with Lennon in white (the preacher), Starr in black (the undertaker), \"McCartney\" in a suit and barefoot (the corpse) and Harrison in blue jeans and work shirt (the grave digger).  Paul is out of step with the other boys, suggesting he\\'s not an original bug. Sir Paul, in an interview with Life, has since explained that \"On Abbey Road we were wearing our ordinary clothes. I was walking barefoot because it was a hot day. The Volkswagen just happened to be parked there.\"  But the theorists refuse to believe him. Well, they wouldn\\'t, would they? NOBODY BELIEVES FAKE PAUL!  Beyonce faked her pregnancy  Forget the Solange theory; remember how everyone decided that Beyonce faked her pregnancy? Yeah.  It was all based on a moment when Queen Bee sat down for an interview with Molly Meldrum in Australia and her pregnant belly appeared to… well, deflate.  In a strange way.  And she was spotted pulling an \"oops\" face just after it happened, if you believe the extremely slowed-down versions of the moment on YouTube.  Whatever.  We label this one SERIOUSLY far-fetched, but, to all the disbelievers out there, it\\'s safe to say that Bey is a pretty awesome mum to Blue Ivy. Surrogate or not.  Miley Cyrus died in 2010 and was replaced by a lookalike  Yup, just like Paul McCartney. Duh!  Apparently Miley\\'s body was found in the desert way back in 2010 and was replaced by another Disney star, who got plastic surgery to look like her.  You can check out all of the (very flimsy and ludicrous) \\'evidence\\' for the far-fetched theory here  What do you think?  Elvis Presley faked his own death  Elvis may have left the building, but plenty of people are still debating over which route he took.  Yup, there\\'s a persistent belief that \"the King\" did NOT die in 1977, he simply faked his own death.  Sigh.  Elvis was, according to theorists, a prisoner of his own fame. He couldn\\'t go anywhere without being recognised and was forced to experiment with wigs and glasses in a bid to go about his everyday life undetected.  But things got… well, they got too much. He decided to fake his death, say goodbye to Elvis Presley and live out his last years in peace and solitude.  Apparently Elvis, much like Shakespeare\\'s Romeo, knew which drugs he could self-administer to create a deathlike state. His extensive experience with the martial arts and yoga was such that he could slow his heart rate and breathing in order to feign death.  And he was no stranger to using a fake name; government documents report that Elvis used the name John Burrows as an alias when he wanted to travel incognito.  Throw in hundreds of rumoured sightings, a seriously speedy funeral (it happened ONE DAY after the King checked out), a mysterious black helicopter floating around Graceland, an elderly man named Jesse who was snapped hanging out with Lisa Marie\\'s son (his grandson) and a rumoured wax body double in the open casket and you have a recipe for a good ol\\' fashioned conspiracy theory. A  lthough we have a feeling a lot of people were so desperate to believe this theory that they couldn\\'t help but find \"evidence\" to support it.  Whatever. Long live the King, we guess!  Keanu Reeves is immortal  If you want to see the proof for this theory, it\\'s here - but we can summarise it for you.  Basically, Keanu Reeves looks young. His face has barely a wrinkle upon it since he burst onto our screens way back when - and, after someone found a portrait of Charlemagne, little minds started working in overtime.  They write: \"Aside from the striking resemblance, the account of the death of Charlemagne rise suspicion.  \"First of all he crowned his son just before dying (just like he knew he was going to \\'die\\') secondly his burial was rushed during cold weather this is a clear hint that they needed to bury a body to not rise any suspicion.\"  They then go on to find a number of people throughout history who look an awful lot like Keanu Reeves (in the sense that they are also humans with dark hair and eyes), and insist this is proof the actor has \\'everlasting life\\'. This is why, they say, he is so generous in his charitable donations; he has plenty of money leftover from his long old life.  We dispute this theory, naturally; anyone else think Keanu just uses a really good moisturiser?  Kurt Cobain was murdered  The Nirvana singer was found dead at his home in Seattle on April 8, 1994.  It seemed an open and shut case; the singer - who had disappeared from a drug rehabilitation clinic - had, according to his wife, Courtney Love, been suicidal and a suicide note was found.  The initial police report stated that Cobain had been found with a shotgun across his chest and an autopsy ruled that he had died by a single gunshot wound to the head and that he had taken a large amount of heroin.  However, Tom Grant, a private investigator hired by Love to find Cobain after he disappeared from the clinic, believed that the singer was murdered.  He claimed that the amount of heroin in Cobain\\'s bloodstream would have made it impossible for him to have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. Grant insists an unknown assassin administered the drug and then shot Cobain.  But what about that suicide note?  Well, Grant believed that the supposed \"suicide\" note was actually a letter announcing Kurt\\'s plans to leave Courtney Love and the music business and that references to suicide had been added later.  But who would have wanted Kurt dead? We just don\\'t buy this one.  John Lennon was killed by the US government  The former Beatle was shot dead outside the Dakota building in New York where he lived by Mark David Chapman on December 8, 1980. Chapman was jailed for murder and is still in prison.  Case closed, right? Wrong.  Obviously.  Conspiracy theories, unable to let it go, have claimed that Chapman was programmed by US government agents to kill Lennon - and that they used the novel Catcher in the Rye as a signal to go ahead with the operation.  But why on earth would the government want to kill John Lennon? It just doesn\\'t make any sense.  Bruce Lee kicked his way out of his coffin  Martial arts legend Bruce Lee was pronounced dead at the tender age of 32, due to swelling of the brain.  But, being so young and healthy, people immediately became sceptical.  And, after Bruce\\'s coffin lid had to be replaced, many assumed he\\'d kicked it off and escaped to live a better life.  Where?  In Brussels.  Hey, don\\'t blame us - we don\\'t come up with these ideas!  North West is the antichrist  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their first child into the world on June 15, 2013 - quite a bit earlier than her original due date.  This could have been down to Kim\\'s pre-eclampsia, but that, for many people, was too logical a suggestion. Instead, they\\'ve decided it\\'s because North West is the antichrist.  Yup, you read that right; the antichrist.  It has been suggested that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were desperate to have their child on 15th June, 2013.  That’s 15/6/2013 in numeric form.  Check it out: (1+5)=6, 6, 2+0+1+3=6Ergo, 6/15/2013 = 666 - the number of the devil.  SIGH - someone spent a lot of time trying to make those numbers work.  Poor little Nori, eh?  Tupac is alive and well and living in Cuba  Tupac tragically died on 13th September 1996, after being shot as he rode in a car driven by Death Row Records chairman \"Suge\" Knight near the Las Vegas strip in September 1996. But plenty of his fans refuse to believe it.  Why? Well, there\\'s the fact he was cremated the day after his death - there\\'s no body for fans to dig up and examine as \\'proof.  The rest of their \\'evidence\\' is pretty shady.  Apparently Tupac staged his own death and fled to Cuba to live out his years in peace with his godmother Assata Shakur.  Following an Eminem reference to Pac’s Cuban refuge and the addition of Pac’s godmother to the F.B.I.’s most wanted list, threads began to pop up on forums alluding that he would return from Cuba in 2014.  Plus there\\'s the hologram performance, which some conspiracy theorists have decided was actually the real Tupac.  And there\\'s all those \\'sightings\\' of Tupac around the world, lurking in the backgrounds of photographs and videos.  Hmm. We\\'re not convinced - are you?  Buddy Holly escaped the Bermuda Triangle  Buddy Holly is a bit of a mystery, mainly because his death is connected to the ultra-mysterious Bermuda Triangle.  Yup, we swear it; the singer’s plane disappeared somewhere over that eerie stretch of water - and now plenty of YouTubers have claimed he\\'s alive and well and living in Ganamede.  Hmm. As long as his music continues to be played, he can live on wherever, surely?  John F. Kennedy was assassinated by the CIA  Everyone has a theory on who killed JFK but, for most, the idea that the CIA was behind the assassination of the president is just too… well, too hard to disprove.  First, the facts: On 22nd November 1963, President Kennedy was riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, when he was shot and killed.  Roughly one hour later, Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for Kennedy\\'s murder; however, Oswald was not in custody long before he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby.  Next, the conspiracy theory: Most theorists do not believe Oswald was responsible for Kennedy\\'s murder, while those that do believe he had help - after all, he was firing an ancient rifle from VERY far away.  And hitting a small moving target from such a distance, in wind, would be difficult.  Footage of the event taken by Abraham Zapruder supported the growing belief that at least four shots were fired - not the three that the Warren Commission claimed. The moments of impact recorded on the film also suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction to those supposedly fired by Oswald - evidence backed up by testimony of several eye witnesses.  Many believed that several shots were fired by gunmen hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza.  There is an enduring theory that the CIA, furious over rumours that JFK was about to \"splinter the CIA into a thousand peaces\", staged the assassination.  And, whether the shots were fired by the \"three tramps\" spotted at the scene of the crime, the agent who fired wildly in JFK\\'s direction from the car behind or a lone sniper on the grassy knoll, it goes without saying that this is a theory that won\\'t be going away any time soon.  Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Suri & Scientology  Speaking in her explosive new exposé “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology”, Leah Remini has claimed that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes left their daughter Suri (at the time 7 months old) to cry on a bathroom floor at their wedding.  After five minutes of listening to Suri’s cries, Leah claims she went to check on the baby and found Cruise’s sister, his assistant and another woman staring at her as though she was ‘L Ron Hubbard incarnate’, a rebirth of the religion’s founder.  The actress claims that she finally convinced the women in the bathroom to pick up the crying baby and give her a bottle of warm milk.  The Church of Scientology, which released a response to Remini on its website, stated of her claims about the wedding: \"Every claim Ms. Remini has made is not only untrue, but ridiculous and stupid. She is just trying to latch onto a prominent celebrity for her own publicity.  “As a note, every guest but Ms. Remini respected the couple’s privacy by not speaking about it afterward. That in itself describes what kind of person Ms. Remini is: self-absorbed, rude and embarrassing, all traits she displayed as a guest of this event according to parishioners who attended.\"',\n",
       " 'On this day in 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart is finally found in Sandy, Utah, nine months after being abducted from her family’s home. Her alleged kidnappers, Brian David Mitchell, a drifter who the Smarts had briefly employed at their house, and his wife, Wanda Barzee, were charged with the kidnapping, as well as burglary and sexual assault.  In the middle of the night on June 5, 2002, Elizabeth Smart, then 14 years old, was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom in her parents’ house in the upscale Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Her captor slid into the house undetected after cutting open the screen of an open window. Elizabeth’s younger sister, Mary Katherine, with whom she shared her bedroom, was the only witness to the kidnapping. Mary Katherine did not inform her parents until two hours after the incident, frightened that the man might return for her if she called out to alert them. She was initially unable to identify her sister’s attacker.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Elizabeth was taken to a crude campsite in the woods just three miles from her family’s home–close enough that she could actually hear the voices of searchers calling for her in the days following her abduction. There, it is alleged that Mitchell, who calls himself Emmanuel and professes to be a prophet with his own Mormon sect, sexually assaulted her.  After two months, Smart, who was forced to wear a wig and dress in a robe and veil, was taken to Salt Lake City and appeared in public, but was not recognized. From there, Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego, where they lived in a series of campsites and under bridges. Finally, the group returned to the Salt Lake City area and, just a couple of hours later, several people recognized Elizabeth. They reported their sightings to police, who immediately followed up on the lead and pulled over a car carrying Mitchell, Barzee and Smart.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Most of the early police investigation into Elizabeth’s disappearance had focused on another suspect, Richard Ricci, who had also once worked as a handyman in the Smart home. Serving time in prison for a parole violation during the investigation, Ricci denied having any involvement in the kidnapping. The trail grew cold after Ricci died in prison of a brain hemorrhage on August 30. Finally in early February 2003, Mary Katherine Smart told her parents she believed another former worker at the Smart home, who called himself Emmanuel, might be Elizabeth’s captor and the Smarts relayed the information to authorities. On February 3, believing that the police were not taking Mary Katherine’s tip seriously, the Smart family called their own press conference to release a sketch of Emmanuel. Several days later, a man contacted police to inform them that Emmanuel was his disturbed stepfather, Brian David Mitchell, and that he believed him to indeed be capable of kidnapping. In the days before finding Elizabeth, the Smarts continued to criticize police for failing to devote enough energy to following up on the lead.  When found, Smart, who called herself Augustine, most likely at the behest of Mitchell, initially denied to police that she was in fact Elizabeth Smart. Undeterred, police took her and her captors in separate cars to the Salt Lake City Police Department, where she was reunited with her family. On March 18, 2003, after Mitchell and Barzee were formally charged, Mitchell’s attorney announced that his client considered taking Elizabeth a call from God. It has since been reported that Mitchell believed Smart was his wife and that the young girl may have suffered from Stockholm syndrome during the nine-month ordeal, answering questions as to why she did not try to escape even though it seemed she had been presented with several opportunities.  Police later discovered that Mitchell had also attempted to kidnap Smart’s cousin several weeks after taking Elizabeth and added that crime to the list of charges against him. Mitchell was declared mentally unfit to stand trial in July 2005 and December 2006; Barzee, who filed for divorce from Mitchell in December 2004, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in the kidnapping in November 2009. On May 25, 2011, after being ruled competent to stand trial in March 2010 and convicted that December, Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison.',\n",
       " 'Uh-oh. Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn’t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who’s struggled with sobriety in the past.  “Paris’ family worries she’ll start partying again because of Tyler,” an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of “far too much drinking” and praising “bottomless red wine and pure debauchery.”  (Photo Credit: Splash)  Despite those red flags, Paris — who’s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson — is smitten. “Paris is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she’s also looking for fun,” notes the insider. “She makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.”  Paris’ family’s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.  “It appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,” the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox’s TV drama Star. “She is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.”  While she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: “People say love ism blind because they do not know what love is. I say unto you, only love has eyes; other than love, everything is blind.”  For more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!

       " \"Her father died when she was just 11 years old.  But Paris Jackson still feels the guiding influence of Michael, which she confirmed on Saturday with a new tattoo. The 19-year-old honored her late dad with a new inking of the word 'Applehead' in cursive on her left foot.  The eight-year anniversary of the King Of Pop's death falls on Sunday.  'You lift my foot and guide me forward': Paris Jackson honored late father Michael with a new 'Applehead' tattoo which she unveiled on Saturday  'Applehead' was a term of endearment the icon would often call his loved ones and those close to him.  'With every step I take, you lift my foot and guide me forward. love you,' she captioned the Instagram photo.  Just this week the actress went on an expletive-ridden Instagram rant at her haters, who criticize her for - among other things - her tattoos.  'A lot of s**t is said about me and people I know and people I'm related to. This is for the people who don't agree with who I am and what I do,' she spat in the dimly-lit series of clips.  Influence: 'With every step I take, you lift my foot and guide me forward. love you,' she captioned the Instagram photo  Nickname: 'Applehead' was a term of endearment the icon would often call his loved ones and those close to him  'Yeah, I get it. Y’all don’t like the tattoos, y’all don’t like the profanity, y’all don’t like... my free spirit, my outspokenness and how I’m a young chick and I should be quiet.'  She then went on to insist that she is doing all that she can to make a decent life - and set a decent example for other youngsters.  'I am a teenager, I am doing the best I can,' she continued. 'I’m working as hard as I possible can to make a living for myself and create my own life.  'I’m fighting for human rights, I’m fighting for animal rights, I’m fighting for the environment. Basically any liberalist movement that will create positive impact on this planet, I’m trying to get involved in.'  Hitting back: Paris lashed out at her critics in a series of lengthy videos on Instagram on Wednesday night  Public: Paris and Prince, and their younger brother Prince Michael Jackson II, made one of their first public appearances at their father's Los Angeles memorial service in July 2009  She also went on to suggest that much of the criticism she has faced may be due to the fact that many of the people who follow her are actually fans of her dad, who died unexpectedly on June 25, 2009.  'Most of my following is usually my father's following and they're a lot older, they watched me grow up,' she reasoned. 'They saw him when he was in his very, very younger [days].  'So understand that the older people that are watching me and seeing what I'm doing don't necessarily agree with all of this because they have very conservative views.'  Both she and her brother Prince have a number of tattoos honoring the late icon; in April the 20-year-old revealed his latest; a leg tattoo depicting his dad dancing with angel wings.\",\n",

       " 'Talk about a True transformation! Khloé Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a “combination of breastfeeding and being very active” for the impressive weight loss.  Mommy’s Little Love A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT  “After I had True, I didn’t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,” Kardashian wrote. “I just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.”  Then Kardashian got down to specifics: “Here is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn’t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn’t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I’ve lost 33 pounds! I’m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I’m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.”  Shortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel “Coach Joe” Bouraïma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a “ridiculous” post-baby diet.  And in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. “I never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives. One of mine is having that one hour where I can be selfish and alone in my place of refuge,” she wrote.  “Staying healthy and active is something that’s very important to me,” she added. “Exercise is something I’ve always used to maintain my sanity and relieve stress. And, now that I have a baby, I still want to keep something that’s my time, my space, something I’m doing for myself.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!',\n",
       " 'Follow\\xading therap\\xady, actor has come to realis\\xade that Jen was the love of his life  Fans who’ve been rooting for Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 split may actually have cause for hope! Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says.  Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie  And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. “He has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while he’s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  However, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.  And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.”  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.  Brad Pitt “much happier” following split from Angelina Jolie  “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” the source concluded.

       " 'Justin Theroux and Selena Gomez have not been exchanging flirty texts with each other following his split from Jennifer Aniston, despite a made-up report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. A rep for the actor tells us there\\'s no truth to it.  John Lamparski / Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows  An alleged insider, however, tells RadarOnline that Theroux \"was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her,\" and now the newly-single actor is pursuing the singer via text. The questionable source adds, \"He\\'s asking for major trouble by trying to hang out with her so soon after his and Jen\\'s split.\"  The supposed tipster goes on to say that Gomez has been receptive to the actor\\'s advances, before further speculating that Aniston will be infuriated when she finds out. The seemingly phony insider says the actress believed the pop star was \"very much her friend, not Justin\\'s,\" so she\\'ll likely see their communications as a betrayal.  None of this is remotely true. While the blog hides behind an anonymous and untraceable source, Theroux\\'s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that he hasn\\'t been exchanging flirty texts with Gomez. Although the actor and singer became friendly after meeting through Aniston, there\\'s nothing \"flirty\" about their dynamic.  It\\'s possible this scenario was created because Theroux gave Gomez a shoutout on Instagram last month while visiting a animal shelter in the singer\\'s hometown of Texas. However, the actor simple suggested she adopt a rescue dog. He certainly wasn\\'t flirting.  Unfortunately, this phony narrative has cropped up before. Gossip Cop called out NW last month for making up a similar story about Theroux hitting on Gomez in the wake of his separation. The pop star was also dragged into the exes\\' marriage back when they were still together. Last April, Gossip Cop busted a bogus In Touch story alleging that Aniston was jealous of Gomez and her so-called \"flirty friendship\" with Theroux.  It\\'s worth noting, Gomez has revealed in interviews that she looks up to Aniston, who gives her \"maternal advice.\" The pop star further noted that she\\'s been a lifelong fan of the actress, so she\\'s particularly grateful that they now \"have real conversations with such a real heart.\" The idea that Gomez would start flirting with her close friend and mentor\\'s estranged husband is simply absurd. Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm there\\'s no truth to the blog\\'s account of events.  More on Gossip Cop:  Margot Robbie\\'s husband fears Leonardo DiCaprio is out to steal her?

The Come & Get It hitmaker’s second solo album was released in 2015 and the star admits she’s found it harder than ever to complete the follow-up, reports aceshowbiz.com.  “This has been building for maybe two years,” she said during a chat on Apple Music’s Beats 1.  “I was really happy with Revival, but at the same time, I was terrified of doing another record because, for me, it could be like it was a step down or I needed to beat that record, and I think every artist kind of struggles with that. So I waited. I wanted it to be great, and had I not waited a good year or two, I wouldn’t have had the best songs I’ve ever had,” said Gomez.  The singer is currently in the process of “finishing up” the third album and is yet to decide its release date.  She gave fans a taste of her new music by dropping Back to you on May 10, and quickly cleared up speculation suggesting the song is about her on-off romance with former boyfriend Justin Bieber.  The 25-year-old says the song was written with her hit TV drama 13 Reasons Why in mind.',\n",

       " \"Independence Day director Roland Emmerich sent shockwaves through Hollywood when he declared that the film's star Will Smith was “too expensive and too much of a marquee name” to star in the sequel, scheduled to come out in 2015. Emmerich had previously declared that it would be impossible to do a sequel without Smith. The about-turn, announced while Emmerich was promoting his new film, White House Down, this week, is part of a changing of the guard in Hollywood that has seen Smith, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt lose some of their cachet. The announcement also comes just as Hollywood has seemingly deemed it no longer needs its three biggest male stars to launch blockbuster movies.  The knives had been sharpened for Pitt when zombie thriller World War Z was being designated a megaflop even before it hit cinemas. With a budget rumoured to be in excess of $400m (£260m) including marketing, it was being touted as this year's John Carter. When the sci-fi adventure bombed last summer Disney boss Rich Ross resigned from his post; the film reputedly lost $200m. The worry was that Pitt's name alone could not sell the picture. In the end, the opening weekend saw the Pitt film take home more than $60m at the American box office and $117m worldwide. The dire pre-release predictions meant that what were in modern blockbuster terms quite ordinary numbers were painted as a success, with suggestions there might be a sequel.  While on the surface the numbers looked good for Pitt they did not quite mask the new reality in Hollywood that views star-vehicle blockbusters as a risky commodity. Monsters University, an animation film from Pixar, beat World War Z to top spot in the box office. Other films released this year with production costs in the $200m budget range, such as Man of Steel and Iron Man, opened with weekends garnering well over $100m in the US alone. The mixed critical reaction of the zombie thriller could also see the WWZ box office plummet in the way that Man of Steel faltered in its second week. For now Pitt has at least avoided the box-office curse that afflicted his contemporaries earlier this year.  It seems laughable to talk about the former Fresh Prince having to rebuild his castle because After Earth “only” took $27m on its opening weekend. But to film trade magazine Variety it was a “crash landing”. There were numerous reasons why, none of which looks good for Smith. Since the 1996 release of Independence Day, every Smith summer movie has debuted at No 1 at the American box office. But After Earth came third, behind Fast and Furious 6, on its second week of release and, even more surprisingly, Now You See Me, a heist movie starring Jesse Eisenberg and Mark Ruffalo. The number is also bad when comparing like with like. Of Smith's previous films, the gross is more in line with his low-budgeted dramas such as The Pursuit of Happyness than blockbuster titles Men in Black and Hancock. All this points to why financiers believing there is no upside in paying Smith a small fortune for the Independence Day sequel.  Tom Cruise seemed to be back on track when Oblivion opened with a more than respectable $38m first weekend. That was the second highest opening for a Cruise vehicle outside of the Mission: Impossible franchise and followed years of diminishing returns from the likes of Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages, Valkyrie and Knight and Day. But that was where the good news ended. Word of mouth was bad and audiences tumbled to such an extent that Oblivion is yet another Cruise effort to not score blockbuster numbers in America. When not playing Ethan Hunt, the last Cruise-led film to break the $100m barrier was 2005's War of the Worlds.  It's commonly asserted that the start of Cruise's demise was his couch-jumping proclamation of love for Katie Holmes on Oprah. Yet Cruise can argue that his box-office average has remained high since. But take away the Mission: Impossible franchise and the numbers are bleak. Before 2005 every Cruise film for a number of years made more than $100m.  The fact is that these box-office figures for Oblivion, After Earth and World War Z would look amazing if the budgets for these movies were not north of $100m before marketing costs. Once you add the cut that cinema chains and home-video outlets take on revenue, movies need to make many times their budget to start being considered a success. Studios need a blockbuster film to pull in nearly $1bn theatrical, another $1bn on DVD and a good, multi-year sale on television for a $200m picture to be deemed a success.  Indeed, the high cost of releasing films is making film-makers sweat at both ends of the budget scale. Steven Soderbergh said he had to make Behind the Candelabra for HBO as the budget of the film was $5m, but the marketing needed for an American release is a minimum of $70m – numbers that don't make sense.  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, speaking recently at the University of Southern California, predicted that there would be an “implosion” in the film industry and only big-budget superhero movies would make it to the cinemas and cost $50 to see, while low-budget dramas would be made for ever smaller budgets and go straight to the small screen.  Compounding the stars' misery is their ageing audience. Three-quarters of the spectators for Oblivion that first weekend were over 25. Younger audiences and families opted for Monsters University over World War Z.  While Hollywood has increasingly been more forgiving about middle-aged male action stars there has always been a tipping point where it becomes far more of a stretch to believe that they are taking on the world single-handedly. Presently that tipping point seems to come at around 50. Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York in 1962. Oklahoma-born Brad Pitt will turn 50 this year. Will Smith, the youngest of the trio, is 44, but the Philadelphia native has nearly always banked on audiences buying into his youthful exuberance as a key selling factor.  Pitt is the curiosity of the current trio fighting against the sands of time. His box office has never been of blockbuster proportions. The big franchise of his career has been the Oceans trilogy, which had numerous stars to share the burden. His stardom has come from public perception and high-profile relationships. But add up the American box office of his last three films, Killing Them Softly, Moneyball and The Tree of Life, and the total gross is less than what Benjamin Button took home. World War Z is his big attempt at venturing into blockbuster territory and, while the raw numbers gave Pitt his highest grossing opening weekend, they are not blockbuster and it seems that he has gambled a decade too late.  The three are such big stars that they even run their own production companies – Pitt runs Plan B, Smith chairs Overbrook and Cruise founded Cruise/Wagner Productions. They call the shots on their movies, hiring directors, working on the scripts and picking projects. Pitt staked his star name that he could turn Max Brooks's novel into the start of a franchise. The jury is still out.  Studios now have more control over their product when stars are not involved. This is especially true of superhero movies. The exception that proves the rule came recently when Robert Downey Jr caused a ripple by threatening to stop playing Iron Man. The studio dithered, no doubt knowing they could save a fortune by letting him go. Fans balked and the studio relented. A hefty payday will see him star in Avengers 2 and 3, a comic-book ensemble that doesn't need Downey Jr in it to guarantee bums on seats.  A caveat is that the appeal of the stars seems to have not been so diminished in foreign markets, especially nascent territories such as China and Russia. There has been a big shift in Hollywood studios' attitudes in the last 10 years as the takings from foreign markets have started to dwarf those of domestic audiences. So while After Earth was deemed to have bombed in America, foreign takings a week later softened the crash landing.  The reaction of Cruise and Smith to their box-office numbers suggest they are in consolidation mode. Cruise has abandoned plans to star in an adaptation of 60s TV show The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and announced that he's making a 5th instalment of Mission: Impossible. There's also talk that he's considering turning Jerry Maguire into a TV show. Will Smith has been on American talk shows downplaying the weak opening of After Earth and, while talking about looking for more risks in his choices and moving away from blockbusters, he has also been rumoured to be preparing for sequels of Bad Boys, I, Robot and Hancock. Although his Men in Black franchise has seen each sequel make less money than predecessors. The stars are following the studios in relying on their best-known characters to sell their movies.  What's intriguing is that there seem to be no successors to Cruise, Pitt and Smith. The recent huge blockbuster franchises have been superhero movies, Batman and Spider-Man, or ensembles based on books, Harry Potter, Twilight and Lord of the Rings. It's hard to imagine Christian Bale breaking box-office records outside of the bat-suit. The summer blockbusters have evolved away from being star vehicles as studios have hit on a formula where they can call the shots. That's bad news for the non-tights-wearing action star.\",\n",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Doha Madani  Cuffs are here.  \"Jersey Shore\" star Michael \"The Situation\" Sorrentino was sentenced to eight months in federal prison for tax evasion, after he pleaded guilty this past January with his brother to filing falsified tax returns on nearly $9 million. Sorrentino will also serve two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and pay a $10,000 fine. He was not taken into custody after his sentencing and will arrange a surrender date with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  The reality star was initially indicted with his brother, Marc, for tax offenses and conspiring to defraud the United States in 2014 but the Department of Justice added charges last year. Marc Sorrentino was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the fraud.  Gregg Mark, Sorrentino\\'s accountant, admitted to filing the fraudulent returns in December 2015 in a Newark, New Jersey, federal court. The accountant admitted to defrauding the government out of $550,000 to $1.5 million in tax revenue. Mark has not yet been sentenced.  The government included charges of tax evasion and structuring funds to evade currency transaction reports in April of 2017. Sorrentino and his brother created businesses to exploit the reality star\\'s celebrity status and did not pay the required income tax on the $8.9 million Sorrentino earned between 2010 and 2012.  Sorrentino failed to file a personal tax return in 2011, instead filed a false corporate return for Situation Nation Inc. and concealing his cash income. Sorrentino made multiple cash deposits in amounts less than $10,000 into different bank accounts on the same day in order to evade bank reporting regulations, according to his 2017 indictment.  The entire cast of \"Jersey Shore\" went to Sorrentino\\'s sentencing on Friday in a show of support.  Sorrentino skyrocketed into fame in 2009 after being cast in MTV\\'s reality series \"Jersey Shore.\" The show featured a group of young men and women living a house in Seaside, New Jersey, while working at a local t-shirt printing business. Sorrentino and the rest of the cast engaged in excessive partying and binge drinking on the show.\"Jersey Shore\" went on for six seasons before its cancellation in 2012.  The show was revived by MTV earlier this year as \"Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.\" Sorrentino returned to film the series despite his legal and personal issues. The star became addicted to painkillers after a 2010 injury on ABC\\'s \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and entered rehab for the first time two years later. Sorrentino entered rehab again 2015 after cracking his ribs triggered a relapse.',\n",

       " 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  By Associated Press  WASHINGTON — After a 35-year acting career and with two iconic television characters to her name — Elaine Benes of \"Seinfeld\" and foul-mouthed Vice-President Selina Meyer — Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been honored with the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy.  On Sunday night at Washington\\'s Kennedy Center, the 57-year-old actress received a stream of testimonials from celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld, Stephen Colbert and 2010 Mark Twain recipient Tina Fey — touching on the multiple aspects of her career.  Fey paid tribute to Louis-Dreyfus at the award ceremony by tracking the similarities between their lives.  \"We both started comedy in Chicago. We both moved on to \\'Saturday Night Live.\\' We both lost our virginity to Brad Hall,\" referring to Louis-Dreyfus\\' husband and former SNL castmate sitting next to the honoree. Fey praised the \"secret precision\" of Louis-Dreyfus\\' comedy and her willingness to make her Seinfeld character so flawed.  \"Julia let Elaine be selfish and petty and sarcastic and a terrible, terrible dancer,\" Fey said. \"Julia\\'s never been afraid to be unlikable — not on screen and not in person.\"  Louis-Dreyfus is the 21st Mark Twain recipient, joining a list that includes Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Carol Burnett. Bill Cosby, the winner in 2009, had his award rescinded earlier this year after he was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.  During last year\\'s ceremony to honor David Letterman, Cosby\\'s name was never mentioned. But this year, two of the performers felt comfortable making Cosby jokes. Late night host Stephen Colbert displayed a sign proclaiming, \"167 days since the last Un-Twaining.\"  With his fingers crossed, he told Louis-Dreyfus, \"I think you\\'ll be OK.\"  Later Keegan-Michael Key come onstage, dressed as Mark Twain himself and proceeded to roast many of the previous award recipients. When a picture of Cosby was briefly shown, Michael-Key quickly moved things along and said, \"It\\'s OK, he\\'s not watching,\" then added that he doubted PBS was a popular channel \"in the penitentiary.\"  Seinfeld, while on the red carpet before the ceremony, recalled first meeting Louis-Dreyfus during an informal audition. His iconic sitcom, \"Seinfeld,\" was still in the planning stages and producer Larry David knew Louis-Dreyfus from their time together on \"Saturday Night Live.\"  \"We had just two short pages of script, and we sat down to read the dialogue together,\" Seinfeld said. \"As soon as she opened her mouth, I knew she was the one.\"  Seinfeld also credited Louis-Dreyfus for having the confidence and strength of personality to hold her own on what he called \"a very male show.\"  That confidence was evident very early for Louis-Dreyfus, who said she knew as a young child that she had a gift for comedy.  \"The first time I really knew was when I stuffed raisins in my nose and my mother laughed. I ended up in the emergency room because they wouldn\\'t come out!\" Louis-Dreyfus said before the ceremony.  Comedian Kumail Nanjiani grew up in Pakistan and never saw an episode of \"Seinfeld\" until he immigrated to the U.S as an adult.  \"But I became a huge fan as soon as I moved here,\" he said.  The co-writer of the movie \"The Big Sick\" particularly recalls her iconic, slightly convulsive \"Elaine Benes dance\" on the show, which he credits to Louis-Dreyfus\\' gift for physical comedy.  \"There are some comedians who think physical comedy is beneath them,\" he said. \"But she was just fearless and ego-less.\"  At the end of the night, Louis-Dreyfus accepted her award with an extended comedic bit and a few shots at new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  The veteran comedic actress first drew laughs by repeatedly referencing her true life\\'s ambition to be a respected dramatic actress — stopping in mid-speech to deliver a monologue from Shakespeare\\'s \"Merchant of Venice.\"  A native of the Washington suburbs in Maryland, Louis-Dreyfus is a graduate of the elite Holton-Arms school, alma mater of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party.  Louis-Dreyfus make a veiled but unmistakable reference to Ford\\'s testimony — framing it around her performance a high school presentation of the play \"Serendipity.\"  \"I can remember every single aspect of that play that night, so much so that I would testify under oath about it,\" she said, to a round of laughter and applause. \"But I can\\'t remember who drove me there or who drove me home.\"  Louis-Dreyfus emerged from Chicago\\'s famed Second City comedy troupe before joining the cast of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Her best-known role is her nine-year run as Elaine Benes on \"Seinfeld.\" More recently, her work as Vice President Selina Meyer on \"Veep\" earned her six consecutive Emmy Awards.  Production on the upcoming seventh and final season of \"Veep\" was delayed as Louis-Dreyfus received treatment for breast cancer. That season is currently in production.  PBS will air the Twain event on Nov. 19.',\n",

       " 'Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading \"Putin is our president\" and \"Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!\" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What\\'s more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city\\'s police force.Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the \"interests of Russians\" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as \"Sevastopol\" but makes no mention of \"Ukrainian SSR,\" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.However, Khrushchev\\'s spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow\\'s direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia\\'s Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city\\'s gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don\\'t know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin\\'s blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow\\'s actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.',\n",

And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.  Manuka honey  Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.  Thanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.  good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT  Natural deodorant  Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded.  So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.  Natural sunscreen  Deodorant isn’t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30.

       " \"When Justin Timberlake takes the stage at Super Bowl LII for the halftime show Sunday at US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, there is at least one famous name who thinks he needs to make reparations.  “If he’s such a gentleman, he’d make sure Janet [Jackson] is there,” Joseph Jackson told The Post.  The singer’s father is not the only one who thinks that Timberlake should make amends for Nipplegate — the infamous 2004 Super Bowl scandal that bruised Jackson’s career and her ego, after a planned stunt turned into a costume malfunction, leaving her bare breast exposed to 140 million viewers.  Since it was announced that Timberlake would be performing at this year’s big game, Twitter has been alight with the #JusticeForJanet hashtag, as users call out the privilege suggested by Timberlake being asked to perform again, while Jackson was not.  Timberlake has stayed mum about including Jackson in his halftime show, although he recently told Beats 1 host Zane Lowe that the two had “absolutely” made peace.  But Jackson family insiders say that just because the singer has forgiven Timberlake for not standing up for her when she was vilified for the incident, she hasn’t forgotten.  “Justin’s solo career took off after that and Janet was blackballed,” one family member said. “He says they are good, but let’s see him prove it and bring her out.”  ‘Justin’s solo career took off after that and Janet was blackballed’  So what really happened in 2004 at Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium) in Houston? Conspiracy theories abound that the wardrobe “malfunction” was secretly planned by Jackson and Timberlake, but Jackson sources say that’s not the case.  They admit, however, that there was great mystery in the run-up to that halftime show.  “When some of us went to Houston, we were told they were doing rehearsals,” said a relative. “People from the NFL and MTV were there so [we] thought we would get a preview of the performance.”  Instead, security advised that final rehearsals were closed to everyone.  “We had heard that they were experimenting on some sort of elaborate production,” the relative added.  It’s easy to forget that Jackson and Timberlake were not the only acts that night. Produced by MTV — who had previously organized the 2001 halftime event — the show first featured performances by Jessica Simpson, Diddy, Nelly and Kid Rock. Jackson took the stage with a marching band for her 1989 hit “Rhythm Nation,” then was joined by Timberlake for his “Rock Your Body.”  The two had a sexy, playful chemistry and had previously been rumored to have been hooking up. Jackson was in the early throes of a romance with producer Jermaine Dupri, but “everyone — including [her mother] Katherine knew the chemistry was there,” a Jackson insider said.  You could practically feel the heat as the two gyrated against each other onstage. At the end of the number, while singing “I’m gonna have you naked by the end of this song,” Timberlake reached across Jackson’s chest, grabbing her right breast and ripping off part of her top — exposing her bare breast, the nipple completely covered by a large silver sun attached by a piercing.  Looking back at video of the incident, it’s hard to make out Jackson’s expression immediately after, as her face was mostly obscured by her hair, but she quickly covered herself with her hand. In photos from the event, Timberlake looks shell-shocked.  Jackson later explained to her mother that the cups of her top had been attached with a Velcro-like fabric that could easily be manipulated or opened to reveal a red lace bra underneath, according to the family source.  The source confirmed that Jackson and Timberlake had hatched a plan for him to rip off the top’s cup, but didn’t alert MTV, CBS, the NFL or even their backup dancers.  “They were like, let’s make this real and show the meaning behind [the song],” the Jackson insider said.  “Her red bra was all that was supposed to show, no nipple, no exposure,” the insider said. “It was meant to be a little racy, but nobody meant for her breast to show. It became a big deal because Justin grabbed the costume much too hard and, instead of pulling the one small part, he tore the bra part, too.” (Representatives for Timberlake did not return calls for comment.)  Behind the scenes, there was confusion, as MTV executive producer Salli Frattini, recalled to ESPN The Magazine in 2014: “There was lots of chaos in the [production truck, and we played it back and we were like, ‘Oh, s – – t. What just happened?’ ”  At first, Jackson — who flew out of Houston that night — had no idea just how big the fallout would be. “At that point, she was just a little upset — a little troubled that her breast was seen in front of the biggest audience in history,” the family member recalled.  But when she exited the stage, no one — including reps from AOL and the NFL, as well as Nelly — would look at her.  “No one said anything when she left the stage,” the family member added. “It was like, ‘Uh-oh, we’ve got trouble.’”  Before the game was over and the Patriots had beaten the Panthers, 32-29, Jackson’s representative had issued the first statement, explaining that Timberlake was supposed to have pulled off the bustier cup only, not the bra itself.  The NFL responded quickly to the incident, making clear it was “disappointed.” The league’s then executive vice president, Joe Browne, said “it’s unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.” (Indeed, the network has not.)  MTV released a statement claiming that “the tearing of Janet Jackson’s costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance.” The network’s then CEO, Tom Freston, alleged that Jackson alone had “engineered” the stunt.  Over the next week, some 200,000 viewers reportedly complained to the FCC, which later fined CBS $550,000; the decision was tied up in the court system for eight years before finally being tossed out in favor of CBS.  AOL, which had sponsored the halftime event, asked for a refund on its $10 million investment. Advertiser McDonald’s called the incident “inappropriate” — but did not drop Timberlake as its “I’m lovin’ it” spokesman.  At first, Timberlake was flippant about Nipplegate, telling Access Hollywood that, “We love giving you all something to talk about.” But he changed his tune shortly after that, saying, “I’m sorry if anyone was offended.”  Jackson meanwhile, issued both written and taped statements, absolving MTV, CBS and the NFL and saying, “It was not my intention that it go as far as it did.”  But the damage was already done.  The weekend after the Super Bowl, Timberlake and Jackson had been scheduled to appear at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards on CBS, where both were slated to perform. Timberlake’s performance happened. Jackson, who was supposed to lead a tribute to Luther Vandross, was allegedly uninvited.  Her punishment didn’t end there.  When Jackson’s “Damita Jo” album came out two months after the 2004 Super Bowl, she was facing a mountain of obstacles. As Rolling Stone reported, Viacom — the parent company then of both CBS and MTV — [hit] back . . . by essentially blacklisting her, keeping her music videos off their properties MTV, VH1 and radio stations under their umbrella. The blacklist [spread] to include non-Viacom media entities as well.”  Jackson told relatives that she was embarrassed and feared she’d never perform again.  “Radio stations wouldn’t play her music. Her album, which was great, suffered,” the family member recalled. Billboard reported that “Damita Jo” was her worst-selling album over a 20-year span, despite receiving largely favorable reviews.  So devastating was the backlash, Jackson stopped attending family gatherings and shut out those closest to her. “She’d drive by [the family’s Encino estate] in her bright yellow Jeep. We’d see her but she’d keep going,” a second relative said. “It was like she didn’t know what to do.”  Loved ones and friends, including filmmaker Tyler Perry, became concerned about Jackson’s health.  ‘MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.’ - Jermaine Jackson  “She’s going into depression, she’s not herself,” her brother Jermaine said at the time. “Justin needs to hold a press conference and condemn CBS, MTV and everyone else for what they’re doing to Janet. MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.”  It took two years before Timberlake would tell MTV News: “If you consider it 50-50, then I probably got 10 percent of the blame. I think America is harsher on women. I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people.”  Not long after that, Jackson admitted to Oprah Winfrey that while Timberlake had reached out to her, she wasn’t ready to reply.  “Friendship is very important to me, and certain things you just don’t do to friends,” she said. “In my own time, I’ll give him a call.”  When Winfrey asked if Timberlake had “left [her] out there hanging,” Jackson replied, “To a certain degree.” She added that all the blame had been put on “me, as opposed to us.”  On Saturday, Jackson issued a statement saying there would be no halftime reunion.  “To put to rest any speculation or rumors as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow, I will not,” she said.  To this day, Jackson’s Waterloo has shaped the culture in unexpected ways.  As a result of the incident, the FCC instituted a five-second tape delay on Super Bowl performances, allowing censors time to catch offensive material.  see also How Super Bowl is protecting itself from Nipplegate sequel Timberlake will perform Sunday at Super Bowl LII's halftime show...  Coincidentally or not, no women appeared again at the halftime show until 2011 when the Black Eyed Peas — including Fergie — took the stage.  Most remarkably, we have Nipplegate to thank for YouTube. Co-founder Jawed Karim told USA Today that he was inspired to create the video site in 2005 after not being able to find any footage of the incident online.  Some who condemned Jackson have finally admitted it was too much.  In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell told ESPN the Magazine that the committee had acted “unfairly” toward the singer. “It all turned into being about her,” Powell said. “In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate.”  As for Timberlake, he recently said that he “stumbled through” his handling of the situation. Jackson family insiders reveal he had to ask a few times before Jackson finally agreed to quietly meet up with him a few years ago in Los Angeles. After talking for a while, the two patched up their differences and sealed their friendship with a kiss and a long embrace.  That said, however, the Jackson insider explained that, “Publicly, Janet will tell everyone she’s forgiven Justin, but privately, she’s reluctant to trust him. He’s reached out to her about doing some things together but I don’t think she’s ready for that. Is she still angry? No. She doesn’t wish him any ill will. Does she still think about it? Not all of the time, but certainly since he’s doing the halftime show again, it’s definitely been a dinner table topic.”  The insider said that more than anything, Jackson is disappointed. “[Timberlake] used to dig her but when it came to supporting her after what happened, he disappeared. That’s not too manly and she didn’t deserve that. Even if she’s chosen to forgive him, it doesn’t mean she’s gotten past how he didn’t man up.  “We believe [the Super Bowl is a chance for him to] show her . . . and the world that he was wrong. He should insist that she come out and do something even if it’s just him apologizing publicly in front of the whole stadium. It’s not too late.”\",\n",

Same way I still can’t believe that Trump is in charge,” Pitt stated. “In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad.”“What I’m most hopeful about is that we’re a global neighborhood now, and we start to understand each other more and more — and yet, you see this reactionary push for isolation and separation again,” he added.“A Trump supporter is fighting against just about everything.

       " 'In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.  Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.  The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, “tumbling through” three national parks, and a music video.  But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the “self-inflicted” situation he’s in.  But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly “ripped apart” the Internet has sided with him.  An article titled “Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword” published on E! said, “Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he’s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he’s doing to right the ship.”  Vanity Fair said, “Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he’s doing a lot of work on himself.”  And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: “People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.”  The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have “Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,” on the interview.  “But of course the timing is calculated,” Borkowski continues. “The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.”  “A lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He’s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn’t go this far.”  Follow @htshowbiz for more  First Published: May 05, 2017 10:06 IST',\n",
       " 'LONDON — Ariana Grande sent her love to fans on Tuesday as dignitaries, survivors, first responders and the people of Manchester gathered to mark the anniversary of the concert bombing that killed 22 people. The pop star wrote in a tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was \"thinking of you all today and every day.\"  \"I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,\" she wrote in a tweet that included a bee, the civic symbol of Manchester.  thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018  Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande\\'s concert at Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Twenty-two concertgoers were killed, and police say more than 800 people were left \"with physical and deep psychological injuries.\" Grande suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour after the bombing and returned for the One Love Manchester charity concert weeks later, which raised funds for victims of the attack.  Last June, Grande was made an honorary citizen of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council. The singer has paid tribute to victims of the attack, including the youngest, Saffie Roussos, who would have turned 9 last July. During Grande\\'s July show in Buenos Aires, the singer reprised her take on \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" which she also performed at One Love. She closed off the song by blowing a kiss and saying, \"Happy birthday, Saffie.\"  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made defiant statements of unity in the face of extremist violence.  Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann\\'s Square; others left hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a \"Trees of Hope\" trail through the city. One note cited U.S. Episcopal bishop Michael Curry\\'s sermon at Saturday\\'s royal wedding: \"As a clever bishop said \\'there is power in love.\\'\"  A girl cries as she looks at at tributes left in St Anne\\'s Square on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, in Manchester, England, May 22, 2018. Andrew Yates / REUTERS  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to \"come together.\"  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still.  Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for a remembrance service at the cathedral.  A choir sang \"Amazing Grace\" and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation.  On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city\\'s St. Ann\\'s Square in the days after the attack.  William read a passage from the Bible\\'s book of Corinthians, ending: \"Faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\"  Robby Potter, who was hit by shrapnel as he waited to pick his daughter up from the concert, said he felt he had to come to the service \"to support the families who have lost people.\"  \"We were very lucky, we know how lucky we are,\" he told Sky News. \"It\\'s a case of standing strong. The country stood strong, especially Manchester.\"  Later, thousands of people — including a choir of survivors — are due to gather for a concert and sing-song in St. Ann\\'s Square. The event will include renditions of Grande\\'s \"One Last Time\" and \"Look Back In Anger\" by Oasis, which became an unofficial anthem of Manchester after the bombing.  Bells on the city hall and churches will ring out at 10:31 p.m., exactly a year since the bomb exploded.  Police say 100 investigators are still working on the case. The U.K. has issued an arrest warrant for Abedi\\'s younger brother, Hashem Abedi, and is seeking his extradition from Libya — a far-from-straightforward process given that country\\'s political chaos.',\n",
       " 'Pro golfer Bill Haas and actor Luke Wilson were both involved in a fatal car crash in California.  Los Angeles police tell KTLA that Haas, 35, was a passenger in a Ferrari that was involved in a head-on collision with a BMW Tuesday evening in Pacific Palisades, Calif. The driver of the Ferrari, a 71-year-old man who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.  The Ferrari also rolled over in the crash, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.  According to USA Today, Haas and the BMW driver, a 50-year-old woman, were both taken to the hospital. LAPD says Haas, a six-time winner on the PGA Tour, was seriously hurt but did not suffer life-threatening injuries.  NBC reports Wilson, the 46-year-old star of movies like \"Old School\" and \"Idiocracy,\" was indirectly involved in the incident. He was driving on Chautauqua Boulevard when the Ferrari clipped his vehicle before colliding with the BMW.  Wilson does not appear to have suffered any serious injuries.

       " 'The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez\\'s break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People\\'s new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.  Bieber and Gomez\\'s last big public date was his father\\'s wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez\\'s family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly\\'s source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,\" the source told Us on March 12. \"The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber\\'s March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: \"Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,\" a source told E! on March 21. \"It wasn\\'t his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.\"  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. \"Selena realized even though he\\'s made some positive improvements, they just aren\\'t a perfect match right now,\" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez\\'s birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies.',\n",

       " 'Update, 12:45 p.m.: Royal reporter Rebecca English clarified that the empty chair at the wedding wasn\\'t a tribute to Princess Diana. Instead, it\\'s protocol to leave the seat in front of the Queen empty.  Btw - I’ve seen some reports about the spare seat by Prince William in the chapel as having being left in memory of Princess Diana. It wasn’t empty for that reason. The seat in front of the Queen is always left empty, I am told by BP #royalwedding — Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) May 19, 2018  But even with the vacant chair aside, there were plenty of tributes to Princess Diana at the nuptials, including Meghan Markle\\'s veil, her bridal bouquet, the floral arrangements, and the reading from Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana\\'s sister.  Original post, 11:38 a.m.: About 600 guests filled St. George\\'s Chapel for the royal wedding today, but one seat was apparently left vacant—and it\\'s believed to be for Princess Diana. While following along with the nuptials, viewers noticed there was an empty seat next to Prince William on the royal family\\'s side of the congregation. The supposed explanation? It was reserved for Prince Harry\\'s late mother.    Getty Images  Royal fans got emotional over the tribute.

All three of her siblings were present at today\\'s ceremony, and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave a reading.  The white roses in the floral arrangements were also included in honor of Harry\\'s mom. He reportedly hand-picked Meghan\\'s bouquet of forget-me-nots, his mother\\'s favorite flower. Markle gave a sweet shoutout with her veil, which was reminiscent of Diana\\'s insanely long \"monarch-length\" headpiece for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.  To top it off, Sir Elton John, a longtime friend of Diana, performed at the lunchtime reception  There was also apparently an empty chair left at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\\'s wedding in Westminster Abbey seven years ago.

       " 'Her biggest project yet just dropped! Cardi B gave birth to her first child with husband Offset on Tuesday, July 10.  The “Bodak Yellow” rapper welcomed a girl named Kulture Kiari. She announced the news via Instagram with a nude photo of herself cradling her baby bump.  Cardi kept her pregnancy under wraps for months before finally revealing her bump during her stint as a musical guest on an April episode of Saturday Night Live. “I’m finally free!” the 25-year-old remarked as she walked off stage from her performance.  Shortly after the happy news was confirmed, Cardi and her sister, Hennessy Carolina, began hinting that the artist was expecting a baby girl. The “Be Careful” rapper confirmed the sex of her little one in a May interview on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show.  In the months leading up to her daughter’s arrival, the “Finesse” rapper canceled several performances. “Shorty keep growing and I be looking like I be moving and everything, but in reality, a bitch barely can breathe,” she told her followers in an April Instagram video.  The expectant mom didn’t completely quit working, though. “She’s been taking a ton of meetings with designers for her Fashion Nova Line,” a source told Us Weekly in May. “She’s stopped doing shows, but she isn’t letting the pregnancy slow her down.” Us also exclusively reported at the time that Cardi was due in July.  The “I Like It” rapper confirmed in June that she and Offset, 26, secretly married in September 2017. “There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep for myself! Getting married was one of those moments!” she wrote in a Twitter note at the time. “Our relationship was so new breaking up and making up and we had a lot of growing up to do but we was so in love we didn’t want to lose each other.”  She continued: “Was one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married. We found someone to marry us, and she did, just the two of us and my cousin. I said I do, with no dress, no makeup and no ring!”  Offset publicly proposed to the artist one month after their top-secret wedding in October 2017 during a Philadelphia concert. Video of what appeared to be the Migos rapper — who has three children from previous relationships — in bed with another woman emerged not long after, but Cardi chose to stick with her husband.

       " \"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

       " 'It’s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves, Cyrus told Jimmy Kimmel about being pressured to apologize for exposing the skin of her back at age 15.  Miley Cyrus doesn’t worry about yesterday. She doesn’t even care about tomorrow. And she certainly isn\\'t losing any sleep over a scantily clad photo of herself published 10 years ago.  Earlier this week, the pop singer retracted her apology for a controversial photo published in Vanity Fair back in 2008. Her curt Twitter retort still stands: \"IM NOT SORRY. Fuck YOU.\" But there’s more.  In a Tuesday night interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Cyrus took a swipe at the New York Post, the POTUS, and everyone who points the finger of shame. \"I never really keep track of the years that have gone by since something like this,\" she said, with a nod to a printout of the resurfaced Post headline about the photo shoot.  \"A lot of things have changed and I think the conversation has changed a lot.... Sure, some people thought I did something wrong in their eyes. But I think it was really wrong of someone to put on top of someone that this is my shame and that I should be ashamed of myself,\" she continued. \"It’s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves. Except Donald Trump.\"  She also recounted the photo session when, at the age of 15, Cyrus worked with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz for the Vanity Fair feature. \"There was nothing sexualized about this on set,\" the former Hannah Montana star said. \"It was every one’s poisonous thoughts and minds that ended up turning this into something that wasn’t meant to be. So actually, I should not be ashamed, they should be.\"  Cyrus covered a lot of turf during her Q&A with Kimmel, from the thin line between \"hoarding\" and \"collecting,\" her special packet of peanuts, living with Liam Hemsworth and her \"new projects\" in Los Angeles. She kept those plans under wraps, but they’re apparently so important, she gave up smoking pot (her \"first true love\") to \"stay focused.\"  Check out more clips from Miley’s appearance below.

       " 'Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model and actress. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that has led to roles in television and film, and work as a spokesperson.  Early life [ edit ]  Cynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of John Daniel Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]  In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modelling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week\\'s coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford\\'s first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management\\'s Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.  Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one semester. She dropped out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]  Career [ edit ]  During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper\\'s Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Hervé Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy\\'s).  In 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael\\'s hit \"Freedom \\'90\" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of \"Please Come Home For Christmas\", \"John Taylor\" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran\\'s \"Girl Panic\" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift\\'s \"Bad Blood\" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).  The red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.  The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]  Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36\".[17] Crawford\\'s trademark is a mole (or \"beauty mark\") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she \"licked off\" her own mole.[18] During the beginning of her career, the mole was removed from her modeling pictures, including her first Vogue cover.[citation needed] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as \"Baby Gia\".[19][20]  Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host of MTV\\'s House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi\\'s Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented \"In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.\"[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford\\'s acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards - Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]  In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]  Crawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world\\'s sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy\\'s list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1\\'s 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\" by Men\\'s Health.[29]  Fashion designer Michael Kors summed up her impact:  “ Cindy changed the perception of the \"sexy American girl\" from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with brains, charm, and professionalism to spare.[30] ”  After modeling [ edit ]  Crawford in October 2009  Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. She continues to provide celebrity endorsement for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[31] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[32]  In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the \"Cindy Crawford Home Collection\" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[33] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[34]  In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[35]  Crawford returned to modeling in May 2011, appearing on the cover of the May 2011 issue of Vogue Mexico.[36]  Becoming, a book about Crawford\\'s life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O\\'Leary, was published in September 2015.[37]  Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[38] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[39]  In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[40]  Personal life [ edit ]  Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 to 1995. After they divorced, she married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.[41] They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999)[42] and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001).[2][43] Both of her children went into modeling.[44][45]  Activism and charity work [ edit ]  When Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff—whom she continues to praise as \"the fourth most influential person in [her] life\"—died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research.[46] Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible.[47] She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[48]  In 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.[49] Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.[50]  Political endorsements [ edit ]  In 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. In 2011, she endorsed Mitt Romney.[51]  Filmography [ edit ]  Films [ edit ]  Videos [ edit ]  Fitness videos [ edit ]  Year Title 1992 Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body Workout 1993 Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge Workout 2000 Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension 2001 Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits  Music videos [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]',\n",

       " '2016 film directed by David Yates  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a 2016 fantasy film directed by David Yates. A joint British and American production, it is a spin-off and prequel to the Harry Potter film series, and is produced and written by J. K. Rowling in her screenwriting debut, inspired by her 2001 guide book of the same name. The film features an ensemble cast that includes Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, Samantha Morton, Jon Voight, Carmen Ejogo, and Colin Farrell. It is the first instalment in the Fantastic Beasts film series, and ninth overall in the Wizarding World franchise, that began with the Harry Potter films.  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them premiered in New York City on 10 November 2016 and was released worldwide on 18 November 2016 in 3D, IMAX 4K Laser and other large format cinemas. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $814 million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2016.  The film was nominated for five BAFTAs, including Best British Film, winning Best Production Design, and was nominated for two Academy Awards, winning Best Costume Design, becoming the first Wizarding World film to win an Academy Award.[9] A sequel, titled Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released on 16 November 2018.[10]  Plot [ edit ]  In 1926, 65 years before the events of the first Harry Potter film, British wizard and \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander arrives in New York, en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman (\"No-Maj\" or \"Muggle\") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a Niffler escapes from Newt\\'s magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted Auror (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob\\'s suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob\\'s tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt\\'s suitcase.  After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died, those afflicted rarely living past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt\\'s beasts to be responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw, Jr. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt\\'s suitcase and erase Jacob\\'s recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them, and they escape after retrieving Newt\\'s suitcase. Following a tip from Tina\\'s old goblin informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.  Meanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou\\'s adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty\\'s bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence\\'s wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus\\'s host, he dismisses Credence as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.  Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. After being subdued by one of Newt\\'s beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody.  MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city that erases all New Yorkers\\' recent memories as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of silver Occamy eggshells to fund his bakery. His breads and pastries are subconsciously inspired by Newt\\'s creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.  Cast [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them panel at the 2016 panel at the 2016 San Diego Comic Con International (left to right): director Yates; actors Redmayne, Waterston, Sudol, Fogler, Farrell, Miller.  Production [ edit ]  Development [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is mentioned several times as a school textbook in the Harry Potter book series, although Scamander himself does not appear in any of the books. In 2001, Rowling published an edition of the \"textbook\" to be sold to raise money for the British charity Comic Relief. The book is a directory of magical creatures written with an introduction by its author Newt Scamander; it does not contain a storyline narrative. (In literature, the creation of such a long work not part of a novel\\'s narrative storyline is known as a false document.[29])  First announced in September 2013, the project marks Rowling\\'s debut as a screenwriter.[30] The film sees the return of producer David Heyman, as well as writer Steve Kloves, both veterans of the Potter film franchise.[31] After Alfonso Cuarón declined involvement,[32][33] Warner Bros. announced that David Yates would direct at least the first instalment of a planned trilogy.[34] James Newton Howard was contracted to compose the score.[35]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography commenced on 17 August 2015, at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden and was completed in January 2016.[19][21][36][37] Several scenes were also shot on location in London.[38] After two months, the production moved to the Cunard Building and St George\\'s Hall in Liverpool, which was transformed into 1920s New York City.[39] Framestore in London produced the visual effects for the film.[40]  Music [ edit ]  On 9 April 2016, it was announced that James Newton Howard would write and compose the film\\'s score.[41] On 24 October, Pottermore published an official first look at the film\\'s main theme composed by Howard.[42] The main theme incorporated John Williams\\' themes from earlier films, such as \"Hedwig\\'s Theme\".[43] The soundtrack was released by WaterTower Music on 18 November 2016.[44]  Release [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them had its world premiere at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on 10 November 2016. The film was released worldwide on 18 November 2016, in 2D, 3D and the new IMAX 4K Laser system.[11][45] It would premiere one day earlier in a number of other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany and Italy, on 17 November. The film would be released in a total of 1,028 IMAX screens worldwide (388 screens in the United States and Canada, 347 screens in China, 26 screens in Japan and 267 screens in other countries). This marked the second time—after Doctor Strange—that a film secured a release in over 1,000 IMAX screens worldwide.[46][47]  Marketing [ edit ]  Publicity [ edit ]  On 4 November 2015, Entertainment Weekly released the first official publicity shots of the film, containing pictures of characters Newt, Tina, and Queenie, and production and filming being held in various sets designed to mirror 1920s New York City. On 10 December 2015, it was announced that an \"announcement trailer\" would be released five days later, on 15 December.[48] Along with the one-minute trailer, a teaser poster was released.[49][50]  During \"A Celebration of Harry Potter\" at Universal Orlando Resort in February 2016, a featurette was released showcasing several interviews with various cast and crew members, as well as the first official behind-the-scenes footage.[51] On 10 April 2016, the first \"teaser trailer\" was released during the MTV Movie Awards.[52] On 10 August, more information and publicity shots for the film were released through Entertainment Weekly, with new information on Ezra Miller\\'s character Credence Barebone and the news that Zoë Kravitz would have a role in the series.[53][54] New images released include the quartet running down a New York City alleyway, David Yates chatting to stars Katherine Waterston and Eddie Redmayne on the set in front of a blown out subway station, Colin Farrell\\'s character Percival Graves interrogating an arrested and handcuffed Newt, and Graves and Credence putting up anti-magic propaganda.[53][55]  Tie-in literature and merchandise [ edit ]  On 26 April 2016, it was announced that the film\\'s script would be released in the form of a book on 19 November.[56] The book, titled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay, was written by Rowling herself. In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film\\'s release, the novelisation of the film was released on 19 November 2016, the day after the film\\'s premiere.[57]  On 7 March 2016 a trailer-preview was released about the History of Magic in North America as it is in the Harry Potter universe.[58] On 7 October 2016, Rowling also released on Pottermore four pieces of writing exclusively as an introduction to the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, titled History of Magic in North America. It includes information about scourers in North America, brutal and violent magical mercenaries who played a significant role in the historic Salem witch trials of the 1600s, as well as info about various American wand makers; the role magic played in World War I; Native American magic; the foundation of MACUSA; the harsh enforcement No-Maj/Wizarding segregation; and life in 1920s Wizarding America; with info about wand permits and prohibition.[59][60]  On 28 June 2016, Rowling released a second part to her History of Magic in North America series, concerning the fictitious Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, detailing the founding of the pre-eminent American Wizarding academy and allowing users to sort themselves into one of the four houses of the school. The school itself is mentioned in the film.[61]  A \"story pack\" based on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was released for the video game Lego Dimensions by WB Games and TT Games. The pack includes a constructible model of MACUSA, figures of Newt Scamander and a Niffler, and a six-level game campaign that adapts the film\\'s events. The pack was released on the same day as the film, alongside a \"fun pack\" containing figures of Tina Goldstein and a Swooping Evil. The cast of the film reprises their roles in the game.[62]  Home media [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts was released on Digital HD on 7 March 2017, and on 4K UHD, 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on 28 March 2017.[63]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them grossed $234 million in the United States and Canada and $580 million in other countries for a total of $814 million.[8] The film was made on a budget of $180 million, with an additional $150 million spent on marketing.[6][64] Worldwide, the film grossed $219.9 million during its opening weekend from around 64 markets in 24,200 screens, both the fifth-biggest in Rowling\\'s wizarding cinematic universe, and the seventh-biggest of the month of November.[7][65] IMAX totalled $15 million from 605 screens.[46] Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $164 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it the ninth-most profitable release of 2016.[66]  United Kingdom and Ireland [ edit ]  Fantastic Beasts went on general release in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 18 November 2016. It debuted with £15.33 million ($19.15 million) from 666 cinemas, the biggest debut of any film in 2016, ahead of the previous record holder, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (£14.62 million).[46][67] The film was surpassed during the last days of 2016 by Rogue One: A Star Wars Story which gained over one million pounds.[68]  United States and Canada [ edit ]  In the United States and Canada, tracking had the film grossing $68–85 million in its opening weekend, with some estimates going as high as $100 million. The film was released on 18 November in 4,143 cinemas, of which 388 were IMAX screens, and over 3,600 were showing the film in 3D.[69][70][71] It grossed $29.7 million on its first day, the second-lowest opening day among Rowling\\'s adaptations (behind the $29.6 million Friday of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets).[72] This included $8.75 million it earned from Thursday night preview screenings beginning at 6 pm in 3,700 cinemas.[73] In total, the film earned $74.4 million in its opening weekend, falling in line with projections and finishing first at the box office, but recorded the lowest opening among Rowling\\'s Harry Potter universe.[7][74] It made $8 million from 388 IMAX screens, $9 million from 500 premium large format locations and $1.75 million from Cinemark XD.[7]  The film\\'s opening was considered a hit taking into account how the story was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise\\'s main character, Harry Potter.[64] It was the top choice among moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend\\'s total $157.6 million tickets sales.[75] On its second Friday, it had a gradual drop of 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second-best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher\\'s Stone. This was in part due to Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day stretch.[76] It ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a drop of just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.[77]  Other markets [ edit ]  Outside North America, the film debuted day-and-date in 63 countries, along with its North American release, where it was projected to gross $90–125 million in its opening weekend.[78][79] It opened 16 November 2016 in 9 countries, earning $6.9 million from 5,070 screens.[80][81] It opened in 38 more countries on 18 November, earning $16.6 million for a total of $23.5 million in two days.[80] In three days, it made $53.6 million.[82] Through Sunday, 20 November, the film had a five-day opening weekend of $145.5 million from 63 countries, above the initial projections.[46] It earned another $132 million in its second weekend after a large debut in China and Japan.[47]  It recorded the biggest opening day of all-time among the Harry Potter franchise in Korea ($1.7 million), the Philippines ($1.2 million),[83] the UAE ($429,000) and Ukraine, the second biggest in Mexico ($1.8 million), Russia and the CIS ($1.7 million), Brazil ($1.3 million) and in Indonesia ($480,000), all behind Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and the third biggest in the United Kingdom ($5.4 million), behind Part 1 and Part 2.[80] It also scored the second biggest Warner Bros. opening of all-time in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.[80] Notably, France opened with $1.8 million, Spain with $1.4 million, and Germany with $1 million ($2 million including paid previews).[80] In terms of opening weekend, the film posted the biggest opening among the Harry Potter franchise in 16 markets, including South Korea ($14.2 million, also the third-biggest opening for the studio), Russia ($9.8 million) and Brazil ($6.4 million), the biggest opener of the year in Germany ($10.2 million), Sweden, Belgium and Switzerland and the biggest Warner Bros. debut in those along with France ($10.2 million), Holland and Denmark. Italy debuted with $6.6 million, the biggest for a U.S. film in the country. Australia opened with $7.4 million, followed by Mexico ($5.8 million) and Spain ($4.5 million).[46]  It opened in China on 25 November alongside Disney\\'s animated Moana but did not face significant competition from it. It earned $11.2 million on its opening day from 11,600 screens, the best among the Rowlings cinematic universe.[84][85] In total, it had an opening weekend of $41.1 million, dominating 60% of the top five films with 70,000 screenings per day. This alone surpassed the entire lifetime total of all Harry Potter films save the last one.[47][86] Similarly in Japan—typically the biggest or second biggest market for the previous Harry Potter films—it debuted with $15.5 million, besting the total lifetime of all the previous films except for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows – Part 2.[47]  The film also set a number of IMAX records. In total, the opening weekend was worth $7 million from 276 screens, which is the second-highest ever in the Wizarding World, behind Deathly Hallows – Part 2. In 33 territories, it opened at number one. Moreover, it\\'s also the third-highest-grossing November international IMAX opening ever, and the No. 1 start for IMAX in November in 19 countries including Japan ($1.1 million), the UK, Russia, Germany, and the Netherlands.[46] In China, it had the biggest IMAX opening among the franchise with $5.1 million from 347 IMAX screens.[47] Overall, the film has earned a global cumulative total of $19.1 million from the format.[47]  It has become the highest-grossing film in Rowling\\'s cinematic universe in Russia ($16.7 million) and the second-highest in South Korea ($24.6 million). China ($41.1 million) the United Kingdom ($37.6 million), followed by Germany ($18.4 million), France ($16.7 million), and Spain ($13.3 million) are the film\\'s biggest-earning markets.[47]  Critical response [ edit ]  The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 309 critics and judged 74% of the reviews as positive, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website\\'s critical consensus reads, \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them draws on Harry Potter\\'s rich mythology to deliver a spinoff that dazzles with franchise-building magic all its own.\"[87] Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating to reviews, gives the film a score 66 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[88] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 90% positive score and a 74% \"definite recommend\".[7][89]  Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film five out of five, hailing it as \"a rich, baroque, intricately detailed entertainment\" and a \"terrifically good-natured, unpretentious and irresistibly buoyant film\".[90] NME\\'s Larry Bartleet also gave it five out of five, calling it \"more enchanting to your inner kid than the Potter films ever were\".[91] IndieWire\\'s Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ saying that it \"delivers the most satisfying period fantasy since Tim Burton\\'s Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street \", and that its layers of sophistication made it one of the best Hollywood blockbusters of the year.[92]  Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a positive review, writing \"Newt Scamander is nothing like Harry, but it has to be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough \\'sameness\\' to make us feel like we are at home again. I\\'m looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us\".[93] John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is \"likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them\".[94] However, New York Magazine\\'s David Edelstein deemed the film a \"distinctly unmagical slog\", remarking that the beasts \"aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating\".[95] In a mixed review, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the film \"patchy but occasionally charming.\"[96]  Accolades [ edit ]  Notes  Sequels [ edit ]  Initially, in October 2014, the studio announced the film would be the start of a trilogy. In July 2016, David Yates confirmed that Rowling had written the screenplay for the second film and had ideas for the third.[115] In October 2016, Rowling announced that the series would now comprise five films.[116]  The first sequel, titled Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released on 16 November 2018.[117][118][119]  References [ edit ]  Literature [ edit ]',\n",

A so-called source tells the magazine, ‘He’s been invited over to Kris’s for dinner numerous times, but Kendall’s told him to ignore the invites and keep away.’  The outlet’s dubious insider goes on to say Griffin isn’t totally comfortable shunning the Kardashians because he’s ‘worried he’s being rude, but ultimately he trusts Kendall’s judgment because the last thing he wants is to be cursed like Caitlyn [Jenner], Lamar Odom and so many others.’  it's here! LIMITED EDITION DropThree available exclusively @saks #KK❤️SAKS A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 12, 2017 at 9:41am PDT  As for Griffin’s inner circle, the seemingly phony source further alleges, ‘His friends don’t think much of Kendall, who they see as stuck up and annoying.’  Advertisement  Gossip Cop also checked in with a source close to the whole situation who assures everyone that the outlet’s article is completely bogus. This is not the first time that the magazine presents false reports surrounding Kendall and Blake’s apparent relationship.\",\n",
       " \"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can’t walk back and forth in both worlds.”  Earlier this year, Erick Sermon recruited Mack alongside Method Man and Mr. Cheeks for “Come Thru,” the first single off Sermon’s upcoming album. “I’m devastated over the news of Craig Mack,” Sermon tweeted. “We just finishing up his new album.”  “It was a pleasure to know you & rock with you,” LL Cool J added. “You $tepped away from the game & did it your way.. I always respected that.”  “I am grateful to have worked with him,” Missy Elliott tweeted. “He was so kind, funny & talented.”  Toney, who helped produce Project: Funk Da World, told the NY Daily News he was working on a documentary about Mack. “Nobody got to understand his story,” Toney said. “I wanted the world to know the talent he had. It was something I wanted people to enjoy, but it was cut short because he was very religious and wanted to go to church.”  Craig Mack – “Flava in Ya Ear”    Craig Mack – “Jockin My Style”\",\n",

       " 'Demi Lovato is six years stronger.  The Tell Me You Love Me singer teared up on-stage at her New York City show on Friday night, after tourmates DJ Khaled and Kehlani surprised her during her set to wish her a happy six years of sobriety.  \"What you\\'ve overcome through trials and tribulations, through dark clouds,\" Khaled told his friend and collaborator. \"You found the sunshine, and now the sun is shining on you forever.\"  \"I\\'m so, so, so, so proud of you, and honored to know you,\" Kehlani added.  After the two exited, Lovato got emotional while addressing her fans, who had begun chanting her name.  \"Kehlani and DJ Khaled, thank you so much,\" the 25-year-old singer said. \"That was so inspirational and so powerful and so meaningful.\"  Lovato then, through tears, walked fans through her sobriety journey.  \"Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning, throwing up in the car,\" she recalled. \"I remember thinking, \\'This is no longer cute, this is no longer fun. And I\\'m just like my dad.\\' So I took a look at my life, and I said, \\'Something has to change. Something has to change, I\\'ve gotta get sober\\' -- so I did.\"  \"The reason I became so open about my story is I know that there are people here tonight that need to ask for help, and I want you to know that it\\'s OK,\" she continued as the audience cheered. \"Mental health is something that we all need to talk about and we need to take the stigma away from it.\"  I feel weak everytime Demi cries 😭😩 https://t.co/8RZlZ4cxyg — zhania (@lovathiccs) March 17, 2018  After her remarks, Lovato went into a gripping rendition of her song, \"Warrior,\" which deals with painful memories from her past. Lovato has penned songs about her troubled family life growing up, with some of the tracks being about her late father, Patrick, who she has at times referred to as \"abusive.\"  Watching Lovato work through her personal struggles has hopefully inspired those who look up to her to do the same.  One emotional rock for Lovato has been her mom, Dianna Hart. On Saturday, Lovato posted to Instagram a sweet photo of her hugging her mother, writing: \"I love my momma so much #myhero.\"  \"So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible,\" Lovato tweeted on Wednesday, further celebrating her sixth sober birthday.  Just officially turned 6 years sober. So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible. 🙏🏼 — Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) March 15, 2018  ET spoke with Lovato just after she reached five years sober last March, and she opened up about keeping clean.  \"What keeps me on this path is there\\'s a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,\" she reflected. \"If I would have continued down that road, I don\\'t know if I\\'d be here today.\"  RELATED CONTENT:  Demi Lovato and Her Mom Open Up About Family\\'s Journey to Mental Health and Wellness  Demi Lovato Celebrates Six Years of Sobriety With Inspiring Tweet: \\'It Is Possible\\'  Demi Lovato Says She Left the ‘Cliquey’ 2016 Met Gala to Go to an AA Meeting  Related Gallery',\n",

       " 'Everything about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez‘s relationship points to success, beginning with their respective empires across the categories of dance, music, sports, entrepreneurship and more, all the way to their joint couple name, “J-Rod.” Indeed, it seems that the couple has finally discovered lasting love.  While they have yet to be engaged as Rodriguez confirmed on the Today show this week, The Knot rounds up some of the reasons why this celebrity couple is on the road to lasting love.  Timing Was Everything—And They See It  Both Lopez and Rodriguez have been honest about their past failures with love—previous marriages and engagements included—and why they’re both ready now. “We have to take our time. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past,” Lopez previously told Good Morning America. “We’re mature now. We’re grown ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  On Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a good way. “To be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,” he said. “It was just too much craziness. I wasn’t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.”  They Share Similar Life Stages  Rodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. “We’re in our forties. We’re both from New York,” he mused on the Today show. “We both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we’ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other—both the good and the challenges.”  Lopez echoed her boyfriend’s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. “I think we’re both in a good place in our lives,” she said on the radio program. “Now at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It’s like, where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help I’m really strong.”  They Sharpen Each Other  With dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don’t know, maybe ever,” she previously told Hola! “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been where I feel like we really make each other better. We complement each other, and there’s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there’s a different selflessness in the love that’s beautiful and different. And healthy!”  Their Modern Family Loves Each Other  “Honestly it couldn’t be better,” Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. “The four of them are amazingly special kids. I mean, of course I’m going to say that because I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way. And they love each other, they get along so good.”  Their Love Story Was Meant to Be  In a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn’t happen. “It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” she recalled. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that… I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’”  Their first date was equally surprising. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she recalled to Vanity Fair. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date.”  Secure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.',\n",
       " 'The third episode in Season 7 of HBO\\'s \"Game of Thrones\" finally brought Jon Snow and Daenerys together. (Erin Patrick O\\'Connor/The Washington Post)  They are all eventful episodes at this point. And they better be. This time we got the most-anticipated meeting of the entire series with Dany and Jon finally coming face to face and we also saw another major character death. But this episode gets some bonus points because it was actually pretty funny. You’d expect things to be nothing but deadly serious as we draw closer to the conclusion, but a bit of levity like Davos’s introduction of Jon will always be welcome. Now to what happened.  [Read Alyssa Rosenberg’s review of “The Queen’s Justice\"]    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Daenerys and Jon finally come face to face  As Jon, Davos and their party sail into Dragonstone, they are met by Daenerys’s greeting party led by Tyrion and Missandei. This allows Jon and Tyrion to make each other’s acquaintance for the first time since back in Season 1. That’s when Jon was just a lowly member of the Night’s Watch and Tyrion visited the Wall so he could live out one of his dreams by peeing off the top. (Those were simpler times.) “It’s been a long road but we’re both still here,” Tyrion says to Jon, which is maybe how I’ll sum things up in these recaps when they inevitably drag on and on. Jon and Davos hand over their weapons, Davos tries to make small talk with Missandei while Jon and Tyrion do the same on their trek to the castle. The conversation is interrupted when Rhaegar, Viserys and Drogon do a well-timed flyby and buzz the group. “I’d say you get used to them but you never really do,” Tyrion notes.  Walking into the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys like she’s about to step into the ring and fight for the unified middleweight championship of the world. “You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen. Rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Rightful Queen to the Andals and First Men. Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. The Mother of Dragons. The Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea. The Unburnt. The Breaker of Chains.”  Davos and Jon share a glance before Davos chimes in: “This is Jon Snow … he’s King in the North.” It’s the funniest moment of an episode that had a few legit laugh lines. The back and forth that follows and the conflict at the center of it gets to the main issue at the heart of the show. Daenerys wants Jon to bend the knee and pledge loyalty in her effort to take the Iron Throne. Jon could care less about the Iron Throne and is more worried about the army of dead that’s on its way to wipe out all of humanity. The very same army that almost everyone he tells about refuses to believe actually exists.  Dany does her best to talk Jon into bending the knee, using both logic and intimidation — the North has pledged in perpetuity to House Targaryen, she has the dragons, she has the Dothraki. She’ll make Jon warden of the North, he just has to bend that knee. But he won’t shut up about the White Walkers and the Night King. Dany runs through the hell she’s endured from the moment of her birth and maybe rips off a Tupac lyric in the process (“So many men have tried to kill me i don’t remember all their names”) and tells Jon that what got her through everything was faith in herself, that she was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. She does not lack confidence. Jon reminds her that she’ll rule a graveyard if the Night King isn’t stopped. Davos steps up and tells everyone that Jon is no slouch himself. Maybe Dany has destiny on her side, but look at Jon — from bastard to King in the North, the first to bring men and wildlings together, he even took a knife in the heart and gave his own li — hold that thought, Davos. Jon shoots him a look. Let’s not get into the whole black magic resurrection thing right now, we just met these people.  Tyrion finally says what we were all thinking — if these battles of the living don’t matter, then what’s the harm in just bending the knee? But Jon still can’t do it, and to Dany this means he’s in open rebellion. But she won’t make him a prisoner. Yet.  Jon and Tyrion get more time to catch up when they go separately to the designated brooding corner of Dragonstone. Tyrion is brooding because he didn’t see the Euron Greyjoy’s surprise attack coming; Jon is brooding because it is simply what he does. “You make me feel like I’m failing at brooding,” Tyrion tells Jon (another laugh line!), before telling him that he actually believes Jon about the White Walkers. That doesn’t mean it will be easy to convince other people, whose minds can handle the idea of a problem like Cersei (“a familiar monster”) but not one like an army of the dead. Tyrion expertly finds a middle ground, though — he convinces Jon that Daenerys is on the side of good and that it’s unreasonable to expect her to commit to fighting an enemy she hasn’t seen as explained by a man she doesn’t know. So what’s something reasonable he can help Jon with?    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Kit Harington as Jon Snow in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  And that would be the dragonglass buried beneath Dragonstone. Dany can barely be bothered with this, but Tyrion says this dragonglass can apparently kill White Walkers, or something like that. (He seems as annoyed with this oh-so-convenient plot device as many of us are.) Dany’s more interested in whether Tyrion himself believes in the White Walkers and he drops an ancient piece of wisdom — a wise man once said you should never believe something just because you want to believe it. Daenerys busts him: “Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?” Tyrion convinces her that she has nothing to lose by giving Jon the dragonglass; Dany wants to know about the whole “knife in the heart” thing Davos briefly mentioned and Tyrion tries to pass it off as those crazy northerners and their crazy talk.  Later, when Dany tells Jon she’ll allow him to mine for dragonglass, the two seem to have found at least a tenuous truce. Jon wonders if this means that Dany believes him about the undead, but doesn’t get an affirmative response.  [‘Game of Thrones’ killed off one fan favorite but regained another]    Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as Tyene Sand, Hafpor Julius Bjornsson as Gregor Clegane, Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Cersei is just as sadistic as ever  Euron Greyjoy takes a victory lap through King’s Landing, being cheered on by the peasants as he drags Yara Greyjoy and Ellaria Sand behind him as prisoners. The whole thing is very arousing to him, but then again this guy seems to be in a constant state of arousal. He gets a full round of applause as he walks into the throne room, where he’s greeted by Cersei on the Iron Throne and presents her with his previously promised gift. He gives her what no other man could give — justice. Ellaria, who knows the rest of her life is going to be unspeakably awful (and that was before spotting the Mountain) spits at Cersei’s feet.  Euron’s intentions are clear — he wants to marry Cersei and take the power that would come with their union. Cersei agrees, but not until the war is won. Euron is feeling good about things, enough to taunt Jaime that he’ll soon be taking his place next to Cersei, on the throne and in the bedroom. He even asks for advice: “Gentle or rough?” before adding something off-color that cannot be printed in a publication like this, unless, that is, it is said by the White House communications director.  Down in the Red Keep, Cersei relishes time with her two Dornish prisoners, Ellaria Sand and the One Sand Snake Who Didn’t Die. And for the next few minutes it’s pure, uncut Cersei. The primo stuff. “I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover’s head,” she tells Ellaria, and goes from there. Crossing Cersei in any way will provoke her; murdering her only daughter gets you the special treatment. Cersei’s first act of revenge against Ellaria — you get the feeling this will be drawn out in an agonizing way — is to kill the Living Sand Snake the same way Ellaria killed Myrcella, a kiss with poison. Cersei plants the kiss of death (and quickly drinks the serum) and explains how Ellaria (chained and gagged mere feet away from her daughter) will watch the slow death that will unfold over the next few days. “Your daughter will die here in this cell and you will be there watching when she dies.”  A little torture and murder gets Cersei hot and bothered, because soon she’s jumping Jaime’s bones and the two of them are back to their passionately incestuous ways. The next morning a toweringly confident Cersei not only doesn’t make Jaime hide when a chambermaid comes knocking to tell her she has a visitor, but also instructs said chambermaid that they’ll need fresh sheets for the bed. (See, this was a funny episode.)    Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Diana Rigg as Olenna Tyrell in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)    Olenna Tyrell has zinged her last zinger  We were all gearing up for a brutal and extended Battle for Casterly Rock, but it never transpired. The Unsullied (led by Grey Worm) invaded and suffered some losses, but had a pretty easy time taking the seat of House Lannister. Why was it so easy? Two reasons: 1. Tyrion sneaked the best fighters into the heart of the city through the sewers that his favorite prostitutes traveled discreetly, and 2. the 10,000-strong Lannister army was just a shell of itself. Grey Worm knew it shouldn’t have been that easy and realized they had sort of been had when he sees the Greyjoy fleet destroying the Unsullied’s ships in the Casterly Rock harbor, basically stranding them and making them a sitting target.  As for those missing Lannister men, they were over in Highgarden, easily overwhelming the Tyrell army and taking the city. You have to give Cersei credit so far, her battle plans have been top-notch. Jaime finds Olenna Tyrell alone in her chambers and she is resigned to her fate.  Olenna does have one last speech in her, admitting she did unspeakable things to protect her family but that they were all necessary. Meanwhile Cersei has done things that Olenna didn’t think were capable of imagining, and that she’s truly a monster. “She’s a disease and I regret my role in spreading it,” she says to Jaime. “You will, too.” (Foreshadowing the popular theory that Jaime will kill his sister?) Jaime will still let Olenna die with some dignity, avoiding the fate of Ellaria and simply downing some poison and being done with it. Jaime pours it into her wine glass and Olenna chugs it down immediately, saying she will hate to die like Jaime’s son before dropping her last bit of revenge on the Lannisters and admitting that she was the one who poisoned Joffrey. “Tell Cersei,” she instructs Jaime. “I want her to know it was me.” Farewell, Queen of Thorns. And farewell to the Tyrells, who seem to be more-or-less eliminated from the world.    Ellie Kendrick as Meera Reed Isaac Hempstead Wright as Bran Stark and Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  Bran returns to Winterfell  Sansa has taken to running things in Winterfell, and rather well. Either that or the people in charge of food and armor are idiots, but command does seem to suit her, as Littlefinger points out. In pure Littlefinger fashion, he wants to get to plotting. And he honestly has the most refreshing take on the Battle of the Seven Kingdoms vs. Battle Against the Army of Dead dilemma. Basically — either we all die, or life will win out. And if the latter happens, what then? He goes on and on about how everyone is an enemy and Sansa must think through every possible series of events and how everything is happening at once and it’s a bit confusing but serves as good preparation for what comes next. And that’s the appearance of Bran Stark.  Sansa and Bran catch up by the weirwood tree and Bran informs his sister that he can never be Lord of Winterfell or lord of anything because he’s the Three-Eyed Raven now. “I don’t know what that means,” says Sansa, speaking for literally every single one of us. “It’s difficult to explain,” says Bran, which at least gives me an out from having to explain it. Short version — he can see everything that’s ever happened, and everything that will happen, but he needs to better harness his powers. Sansa wants to know how he knows all this; Bran says the Three-Eyed Raven taught him. Sansa says, I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven. Before they go full Abbott & Costello, Bran starts to get all mystical and Sansa says she has to, uh, go somewhere else right now.  Jorah is healed  The maester in Oldtown checks out Jorah Mormont with some ancient stethoscope and gives him a clean bill of health. Jorah claims it was the rest and the climate that made him better, which would sound better if he was in rehab and not dying of a flesh-eating, brain-infecting bacteria. He’s off to find Daenerys now.  Jorah’s claims of rest obviously don’t convince the maester, who knows Sam operated on Jorah even though it was strictly forbidden. The maester is impressed and asked how Sam did it; Sam just read the book and followed the instructions. The maester then informs Sam that his next assignment is to put together a Malm bed frame. No, he just has to make copies of some ancient manuscripts and scrolls, because that’s what they do in Oldtown.    Conleth Hill as Varys and Carice Van Houten as Melisandre in HBO’s “Game of Thrones.” (Helen Sloan/HBO)  That weird Melisandre/Varys conversation  As Jon Snow came to Dragonstone, Melisandre was watching alone, from afar, before Varys tracked her down. “I’ve brought ice and fire together,” she says, saying that her work is done. She’s also trying to stay out of the way of Jon Snow and Davos, who both have their issues with her. She’s off to Volantis and Varys thinks that’s a good thing, and that she should not return to Westeros. But her final line to him hints that she has one more part to play in this tale: “I have to die in this strange country, just like you.”  PREVIOUS SEASON 7 RECAPS  Episode 2: “Stormborn”  Episode 1: “Dragonstone”',\n",

       " 'Jane Lynch is reflecting on the life and death of her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  “It’s been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,” Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts’ Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. “This is a very sad end to it, but I know that he’s at peace now. He’s in the arms of a beneficent force.”  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox’s Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  “I know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,” Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn’t know Salling’s family and really didn’t know him, regardless of working together for six years.  “He was a hard guy to get to know,” she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  “He took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,” Lynch explained. “Driving into the Paramount lot … at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.”  As Us previously reported, Salling’s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, “knew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,” an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

       " 'Baby on the way! Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.  The former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.  Three months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.  “Life can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then … boom!” Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. “You need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.”  “But after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,” she continued. “Talk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family — my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love–we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn’t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.”  The Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled “What Does It Mean to Be Kind?” to Ava.  Clooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.

       " 'Black Mirror’s “USS Callister” won three Emmy awards Saturday and there could potentially be more in its future—if the episode becomes a series.  “Never say never,” creator and executive producer Charlie Brooker said about continuing the story of the episode’s characters, Variety reported Saturday. “The opposite of never,” executive producer Annabel Jones added. “Forever!”  The episode won Emmys for outstanding TV movie, picture editing and sound editing. Black Mirror also won the award for outstanding TV movie for “San Junipero” in 2017.  In “USS Callister,” Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the chief technical officer of a gaming company who is the starship captain in a virtual reality world. Digital clones of his real-life coworkers make up the virtual crew of the ship. While he’s bossed around in real life, he’s the one in charge in his video game.  The episode also stars Cristin Milioti as a coworker who leads a rebellion against Daly in the virtual world and destroys the DNA samples he has of his coworkers in his apartment in the real world. Jimmi Simpson plays Daly’s real-life boss.  The potential of the story to continue was also addressed when Netflix first released the episode. “I was talking with Louise Sutton, who produced this and ‘Metalhead,’ and she cooked up the brilliant idea of spinning it off into a TV series,” director Toby Haynes told The Hollywood Reporter in January. “I’d love to do a TV series of ‘USS Callister’—it’s probably one of the best pilots for a space show ever. … I think Charlie [Brooker] might revisit it as a Black Mirror.”  While the episode ended with Daly defeated in and unable to leave the virtual reality, its director wouldn’t rule out seeing Plemons if there is a series or sequel. “That’s the fun of it, isn’t it? That’s what this idea is,” Haynes said to the publication. “There is this brilliant idea that he is still alive, and his attempted murder gets pinned on someone. Whose fingerprints do they find in the apartment? There’s so much you could do.”  Jonathan Prime / Netflix  Milioti would like to reprise her role and explore that point from Haynes. “If this were ever a spinoff, in the fake world she would be kicking ass and battling aliens,” she told THR in December. “And then there is the real world where her prints have been found inside Daly’s apartment. He’s dead in his apartment and she has to figure that out.”',\n",

The Shake It Off star, 26, was caught in a passionate embrace with the Night Manager actor, 35, near her Rhode Island home in photos that emerged last night, just two weeks after it was confirmed she had split from the Scottish DJ after a 15 month romance.  Four weeks before the break-up and Swift and Hiddleston had put on a VERY flirty display as they hit the dancefloor at the Met Ball where Taylor was on co-hosting duties with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.  (Image: Instagram)  (Image: Instagram)  Videos from the night - that Calvin was noticeably absent from - show the pair throwing shapes to Beyonce\\'s Crazy In Love and appear oblivious to anyone else around them.  The duo are known for loving a turn on the dancefloor - but was there more to it then just an innocent booty shake?  Insiders later admitted there was obvious \"chemistry\" between the couple and it\\'s clear in the video that Taylor and Tom can barely tear their eyes each other as they gyrate along to the music.  Taylor even suggestively brushes past the actor as she carries on the dance session.  (Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)  According to The Sun Taylor had been \"won over\" by Hiddleston after the flirty dance-off, and while insiders claim he began \"pursuing\" her after they first met, they insisted that there was NO overlap with her romance with Calvin.  “Tom has been courting Taylor since they met – he sent her flowers. She’s been won over,\" a source told the paper.  “The timing of this looks very bad for Taylor. There was an obvious connection with Tom at the Met Gala – you can see that in the video of them dancing together.\"  They continued: “Her people are insistent that no one else was involved in the split with Calvin, which is most likely the case.  “But it feels pretty disrespectful to be moving on to someone so public so quickly.”  Read more: Taylor Swift caught gazing at Tom Hiddleston while she was still with Calvin Harris after spending the evening together  (Image: REX)  The new couple also spent the night together before the gala event.  Both were guests at Anna Wintour\\'s private dinner on the eve of the fashion bash, with Taylor spotted gazing at the actor in the hallway of the New York residence as he headed home with actor Idris Elba.  Another insider claimed after the Met Gala it was \"no surprise\" these two have got together.  “She wasn\\'t single at the time of the Gala but the chemistry between them was very obvious, so it\\'s not really surprising that he wants to get together with her now,” an insider told Reveal magazine.

Paris, the 20-year-old daughter of the late Michael Jackson, address her critics on social media, telling them not to worry about her or her family’s business.  “Dear social media followers, friends, stalkers, lovers and haters, and fellow moonwalkers: Please do not tell me/demands/try to control how I handle my relationship with the people in my life, specifically my family,” she wrote in an Instagram Story.  “As amazing and as s—-y as things can be, it is no one’s business but ours.

Searching for something to do I looked at my teacher and mouthed \"May I use the restroom?\" She said sure and I scurried out of the gym.',\n",
       " 'After seemingly tweeting about his ex-wife Miranda Lambert’s relationship drama, Blake Shelton is now staying mum.  The country music singer, 41, tweeted about “karma” last week following the news that Lambert is dating married musician Evan Felker, and fans immediately speculated he was calling out the “Tin Man” singer.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “It was a personal thing that’s in a small circle of my people and that’s why it was written the way it was, and then people took it and make it into what they want to make it into, which I don’t want any part of that,” Shelton told Extra on Monday when asked directly about his tweet.  “But at the same time, I can’t help but to think it’s funny how these fires get lit and it takes off and I don’t have time to care. That’s why I’ve kind of moved on,” he added.  Shelton spoke to Entertainment Tonight about his tweet as well and said it wasn’t fully intended for his fans to understand.  John Shearer/Getty  “If it was meant for people to know exactly what it meant, it wouldn’t have been so cryptic,” he told the outlet during a Facebook Live interview with his fellow Voice coach Kelly Clarkson.  “But I can tell you it’s been, actually, very entertaining to watch the world run with it and assume what they think it’s about,” he continued.  Shelton said most guesses as to what his tweet was about were not entirely correct, adding, “I’ll say this, people are way off the mark. But I don’t have time to worry about it.”  Last week, he tweeted, “Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!”  Miranda Lambert, Evan Felker Jason Merritt/Getty; Frazer Harrison/Getty  While the “I Lived It” singer demurred on who or what he was exactly tweeting about, multiple sources previously confirmed to PEOPLE it was indeed about the 30-time ACM award winner.  One Shelton insider says he feels “vindicated” after news broke that Lambert was dating the Turnpike Troubadours frontman, who filed for divorce from his estranged wife Staci Nelson two weeks after meeting Lambert for the first time in person.  According to another source close to the estranged spouses, Lambert and Felker, both 34, connected via text message before his band opened for the country superstar during her Livin’ Like Hippies Tour for three dates in early February. Lambert’s split from former boyfriend Anderson East was made public in early April.  RELATED VIDEO: Miranda Lambert’s New Boyfriend’s Wife Addresses Her Tough Week After Relationship News Breaks  “They had never met and she had started texting him about looking forward to playing together and getting to know each other and maybe they could write because she really liked his writing sort of thing,” the source said. “It started very much about work. He was completely thrilled. By the time he was leaving for tour, it had become a lot flirtier.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

When Felker was supposed to return home to Nelson in Oklahoma, he allegedly skipped his flight, telling Nelson via email, “I’m not coming home this week,” according to the source.  In the midst of the drama last week, Nelson alluded to the cheating allegations in a “public service announcement” posted to her Instagram Story on Thursday. “PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you,” Nelson, who continues to use Evan’s last name on social media, captioned a teary-eyed picture of herself.',\n",

She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that “Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.”Known in some circles as “the Poverty Pimp,” Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda’s, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.While the word “color” may have been been “Congress” since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick – 1tch',\n",

       " 'Roseanne Barr is well aware that fellow sitcom legend Jerry Seinfeld has a soft spot for cursed comedians, and RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively the disgraced comedy queen is now begging him to help her out of her current mess.  “Jerry’s word carries a lot of weight in Hollywood,” an insider told Radar. “He’s respected for being generous, honest and kind.”  Seinfeld has famously stood by a few fellow funnymen who’ve found themselves on the blacklist, like co-star Michael Richards and Louis CK. Now a source tells Radar exclusively Barr is asking Seinfeld to consider having her as guest on his show Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.  “She wants to give her side of the story in a casual setting and reassure people she’s not the pariah she’s made out to be.”  As Radar readers are well aware, Barr faced a swift comeuppance after her racist Twitter rant in May. The hit revival of her show was immediately cancelled, and a reboot minus the controversial comedian will replace it.  In June, Seinfeld came to Barr’s defense, telling ET “I didn’t see why it was necessary to fire her.  “Why would you murder someone who’s committing suicide?” he asked, then added, “But I never saw someone ruin their entire career with one button push. That was fresh.”  The support from one of the country’s most beloved comedians has helped Barr as she tries to recover her reputation.  “She really appreciated the way Jerry stuck up for her and said she shouldn’t have been fired,” the source said. “That’s given her hope.”',\n",
       " 'If you\\'ve enjoyed her many bonkers interviews over the years (some of which, to our minds, are every bit as entertaining as her funniest film roles), then you\\'re likely aware that Jennifer Lawrence loves alcohol and reality television.  So it\\'s not surprising that J-Law might have a bit of a thing for Kourtney Kardashian sperm donor and bold innovator in the use of facial hair to camouflage booze bloat, Scott Disick.  On second thought, it is surprising, but only in the sense that we\\'re shocked Scott is still alive.  Anyway, Jen revealed her love for the Lord in a recent interview with Oprah, in which she revealed that Scott would be one of her three ideal dinner guests.  (The other two were Luann DeLesseps and Bethenny Frankel, both of Bravo\\'s Real Housewives franchise. Jen ... we\\'re concerned.)  Given that Jen chose Scott over any of the women in the Kardashian clan, it\\'s not surprising that certain tabloids already have these two bedding down together.  It\\'s also not surprising that some of these same publications are casting Kourtney in the role of the insane ex:  According to the Australian version of OK! magazine (because why wouldn\\'t news about three American celebs reach Sydney first?), Kourtney is pissed about the possibility of Jen and Scott hooking up.  In fact, Kourt has reportedly warned Lawrence to keep her mitts off her boozy baby daddy.  The subtly-titled piece “Kourtney Warns J. Law: Stay Away From Scott!” doesn\\'t offer anything in the way of quotes or evidence, and instead poses an argument along the lines of \"makes sense if ya think about it.\"  The article also doesn\\'t mention the fact that Kourtney is dating Younes Bendjima.  Or that Scott is with Sofia Richie.  Or that Jen was clearly joking, and her ideal dinner party would really just consist of Meryl Streep playing three different roles.  Look, we believe Jen when she says she genuinely enjoys Keeping Up With the Kardashians (though it\\'s worth noting that she\\'s said she watches the show \"to fall asleep.\" Celebrities--they\\'re as bored with the Kardashians as the rest of us!).  But there\\'s a difference between enjoying a reality show and wanting to enmesh yourself in that world.  We like watching Naked and Afraid, but the thought of a single genital mosquito is enough to keep us inside for the bulk of 2018.  Hey, if the mere mention of Scott Disick doesn\\'t bring to mind a bloodsucker who will spread disease to your nether regions, then you\\'re not sufficiently wary of the Lord.',\n",

The former Buffy the Vampire Slayer star was taken into custody in Palm Springs, California, on Oct. 11, as the result of an alleged domestic dispute between the actor and an unnamed woman, who is believed to be his girlfriend.  Brendon -- who played Xander Harris on the popular teen dramedy vampire series from 1997 to 2003 -- was arrested on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.  Sgt. William Hutchinson of the Palm Springs Police Department tells ET that the incident in question happened around 9 p.m. at the Saguaro Hotel.

Hollywood's Most Memorable Mugshots  The 46-year-old actor -- who has had numerous run-ins with the law in the past, including four arrests in 2015 -- allegedly pulled the woman's arm and then her hair after getting into an argument.  Police tell ET that the woman has two other protective orders against Brendon in both New York and Florida. The order allows Brendon to be near the woman, but prohibits him from threatening, harassing, injuring or assaulting her.  Brendon was released from custody on Oct. 12 on a $50,000 bail bond, according to booking records. He is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 28.

The judge reportedly ruled that Brendon, -- who has long struggled with substance abuse and depression -- would not serve jail time pending completion of drug and alcohol counseling and avoiding trouble with the law for a year.

       " \"If you were left thinking, 'I've seen that face before' when Netflix hit Stranger Things first catapulted teen star Millie Bobby Brown to stardom - you weren't alone.  In fact, the now-13-year-old's near-identical resemblance to a fellow on-screen starlet is now the source of much hype on social media, with thousands of people taking to Twitter and Instagram to highlight the uncanny similarities between Millie and 36-year-old actress Natalie Portman.  And it's not just the simple similarities in terms of facial features like their noses, mouths, and dimples, that has people talking; interestingly both women have had shaved heads for previous roles, and both have modeled similar red carpet looks - making the resemblance between them all the more remarkable.  Twins: Millie Bobby Brown is a doppelganger of Natalie Portman and the similarities are shocking, like this photo of Millie in Stranger Things (left) and Natalie in V for Vendetta (right)  Crazy: Millie, 13, (left) at Netflix's Stranger Things Season 2 premiere on October 26, 2017 and Natalie, 36, (right) at the Flirting With Disaster premiere on March 21, 1996  ‹ Slide me › Spot the difference: Everything from the shape of the actress's faces to the way that they have been styled for previous roles are similar. Millie is pictured left, and Natalie right  While this is by no means the first time two celebrities have been compared in terms of their similar looks, this is arguably the most impressive, with a series of side-by-side images revealing just how alike Millie and Natalie are.  In particular, pictures of the two with shaved heads - Millie for her ongoing role as Eleven in Stranger Things, and Natalie for her part in 2006 thriller V for Vendetta - have social media users convinced that the duo must be related in one way or another.  Although Natalie did not shave her head to play Evey Hammond until she was 25, while Millie has been modeling the style on and off since she began filming for Netflix at age 12, the pair almost indistinguishable - despite the 13-year age gap between them.  Many of the comparative images being shared on social media have actually left some users unable to tell which actress is which, while others have been prompted to demand 'answers' about how their similarities have only just come to light.  'Are Natalie Portman and Millie Bobby Brown related? I need answers!' one person wrote on Twitter, while share a series of lookalike images of the two.  Bald: The similarities between Millie (left) and Natalie are all the more obvious to see when images of them both with shaved heads are placed side by side  Hair: Millie attended the 75th Annual Golden Globes on January 7, 2018 and had the same exact slicked back hairstyle that Natalie rocked on a red carpet in January 1990  Scary: Both girls had to shave their heads for roles, as Millie plays Eleven in Stranger Things and Natalie played Evey Hammond in V for Vendetta in 2006  Shocking: One Twitter user shared a photo she edited where she morphed both Millie and Natalie's faces together and you cannot even tell who is who  'Well, clearly Millie needs to play Natalie's daughter at some point. Make it happen, Hollywood,' another person pointed out, noting that someone may as well capitalize on the incredible physical similarities between two such talented stars.  Another person chimed in that the process of being compared to another Hollywood star has landed Millie a spot among a group of incredibly successful actresses.  'Millie can join the pack of Winona Ryder, Natalie Portman, and Kiera Knightley of looking the exact same,' the Twitter user wrote.  Others were convinced that there was something a bit more sinister at play - perhaps those who are fans of Millie's sci-fi series which focuses on such eerie goings on.,  'I need a conspiracy video on this,' one person joked, while another insisted: 'She's actually a Natalie Portman clone created to grace us with more Natalie Portman.'  Identical: In another comparison tweet, someone pointed out how much Millie looks like the character Natalie played in Beautiful Girls back in 1996  Can you tell the difference? Not only are their eyes and noses the same, they both have the same exact mouth and dimples  Happy: Millie has tried similar hairstyles to Natalie, like these slicked back buns on the Tonight Show on October 31, 2017 and Natalie’s at an award show on November, 14 2003\",\n",

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: \"If she played the men\\'s circuit she\\'d be, like, 700 in the world.\"  He qualified the comments by saying: \"That doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything\\'s possible; maybe at some point a women\\'s tennis player can be better than anybody.\"  But he added: \"I just haven\\'t seen that in any other sport, and I haven\\'t seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men\\'s circuit, it would be an entirely different story.\"  Williams later responded on Twitter: \"Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  \"I\\'ve never played anyone ranked \"there\" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I\\'m trying to have a baby. Good day sir.\"  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January.

The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was \"trying to talk women\\'s tennis down\" but said \"the reality\" was that \"men are stronger in general\".  \"I would hope that I would win against Serena,\" he added.  \"It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man?

Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women\\'s player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.

       " 'Jennifer Lawrence would very much like to be excluded from Harvey Weinstein’s narrative. The actress, who previously worked with the disgraced mogul on the film Silver Linings Playbook, has continually been dragged into stories about his fall from grace—most recently when Weinstein’s legal team used an old quote from Lawrence to defend the producer’s character in court. (In case you forgot: he’s been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women but denies all claims of nonconsensual acts.) Lawrence’s press tour for Red Sparrow has, as a result, doubled as a Distance Yourself from Weinstein Tour. She talked about him on 60 Minutes, she talked about him with Oprah, and now she’s talking about him on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show.  In a Monday night interview—after Colbert provided her with a few rounds of rum (a bit he’s done before with stars like Dakota Johnson)—the actress excoriated Weinstein’s team for using her words without her permission: “He is just that horrible ass boil that does not go away,” she declared. “You pop the ass boil. He’s just the worst. When is it gonna end?”  The Academy Award winner explained that she was deep in the throes of her Red Sparrow press tour when she caught wind of what Weinstein’s legal team was doing.  “In the middle of the night, I had to come up with a statement in London,” she said. “And I was like, it’s still not over?”  Nope, it’s still not over—and it won’t be over for quite some time, considering how many legal snafus Weinstein has waded into since the scandal broke last October. Still, “horrible ass boil” is an entertaining entry to Lawrence’s oeuvre of Weinstein disses. In her 60 Minutes interview, she was a touch more visceral.  “What he did is criminal and deplorable,” she said of the allegations. “And when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him. The way that he destroyed so many women’s lives. I want to see him in jail.”  Red Sparrow hits theaters this Friday—so savor the few days we have left of Lawrence’s publicity-tour jabs.

       " \"A fortune in the bank, a beautiful wife and a booming film career are not enough to make Brad Pitt happy.  In an extraordinary interview which recalls a doleful rant by his wife Jennifer Aniston earlier this year, the 37-year- old actor says he feels oppressed by fame and has come close to a nervous breakdown.  The star of Fight Club and Seven tells the magazine Vanity Fair he is bored with movies and acting and looks forward to retiring from Hollywood in five to seven years.  Pitt says he spent 18 months in therapy after hitting a psychological barrier. 'I crashed and burned so I wanted to understand how I operate. I came from a place where you had to be crazy to go to a crazy doctor, and my background is very few words.'  In a reference to the singer who spent several weeks in hospital after a breakdown this summer, he adds: 'I've thought about pulling a Mariah Carey but I know too much now.'  Interviewed by Vanity Fair in April, Friends star Miss Aniston said the year in which she married Pitt had been the hardest year of her life and she was dogged by 'low self esteem' and a 'sense of shame'.  Her husband talks in a similar vein about the 'sickness' of his life.  He says: 'The thing with our marriage was that there was an opening in the Hollywood couple slot and unfortunately we've fallen into it, which I don't like very much.  'I don't like throwing us into this box. It doesn't leave us room to be human, to make our mistakes and have our struggles, because that will just be another story, a whole new other life for the rags.'  Like so many before him, Pitt complains he is public property and unable to conduct a normal life.  'We are treated as special. We get away with things that other people can't. And you start to believe the lie that you are special, that you're better than other people.  'You start demanding that kind of treatment. Most of the time I fight it because I know I'm going to get older and it's going to go away but at times I succumb to it.  'I'll tell you truthfully I am completely bored with myself in films. It's time for me to try either a new direction or new horizons.  'I have other interests I want to pursue that mean more to me.  'I find myself looking forward to a family.  'It's not that I'm self absorbed. Anything that's going to take the focus off myself, I welcome.'\",\n",

She managed to stay pretty tight-lipped about it on the reality show last year, claiming \"a lady never tells\" when quizzed during a game of Truth or Dare.  Like Meghan, Camilla is an eager charity worker, having worked for the Halo Trust - the mine-clearance charity whose work was promoted by Princess Diana - and has described the actress as \"amazing and beautiful\".

       " 'Prince Harry\\'s net worth is 8-figures. Chris Jackson - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19.  Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama \"Suits,\" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $5 million.  That\\'s a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry\\'s net worth is at least $25 million (£18 million) and as much as $40 million (£28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.  Here\\'s where all that money comes from.  Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.  Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family\\'s public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William\\'s allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.  Chris Jackson/Getty  Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana\\'s estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.  Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider\\'s Shana Lebowtiz.  A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn\\'t make much sense. The princes likely don\\'t have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.  Still, the merging of Harry and Markle\\'s finances could \"cause tax headaches\" and create some \"mundane hurdles\" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.  Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family \"to outside scrutiny,\" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.  Eddie Mulholland/AP  \"The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,\" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. \"Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or \\'wages\\' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.\"  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle\\'s dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.  That won\\'t be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.

Back in January, she hilariously Snapchatted herself hosting Trump’s “Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year,” which she jokingly promised to host earlier that month.  Last June, the Lip Sync Battle host told the Celebrity Apprentice alum to “grow the f—k up” after he bashed a New York Times story about his stance on the Senate health bill.  But she didn’t stop there. Earlier that year, Teigen slammed Trump’s views on immigration after he tweeted, “We must keep ‘evil’ out of this country.” She wasted no time before snapping back, “What time should we call your uber?”  The Sports Illustrated stunner opened up about her feud with the hotel mogul during a February 2017 interview with USA Today. “I’ve been [trolling him] forever and I take pride in that. I can’t believe somebody could actually do this all day, every day, and still be president,” she quipped at the time. “If I mysteriously go missing in the next four years, then that’s what happened.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!',\n",
       " \"Back in June of 2009, MTV fans were introduced to Amber Portwood with her episode of 16 & Pregnant, and for the subsequent seven years, she has continued to share her story as one of the four women picked for the hugely popular spin-off series, Teen Mom. In those seven years, Amber has shared all of the very high highs and very low lows of her life, and has had one of the most tumultuous journeys out of all the young women on the series. Then in 2014, Amber put out her first memoir “Never Too Late” and it became apparent that not everything was shared with the MTV cameras. So, go behind-the-scenes, and find 15 of the most shocking things about Amber, her life and filming that you never knew!  15. Early Life  Amber’s story on 16 & Pregnant jumps right into her pregnancy with Leah, but her book gives fans a better idea just who Amber was before becoming pregnant at a young age. Amber goes into detail about her childhood, which started off with normal and happy family memories, but everything changed when her younger sister Candace, died at only two weeks old of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). “After Candace died, my family started to deteriorate. That was the start of the bad times that turned everything into a blur in my memory,” she wrote in the book and went on to reveal how both her parents developed drinking problems, but her dad’s alcoholism turned her parent’s relationship into nothing but screaming matches.  ADVERTISEMENT  2  14. Suicide Attempt  One of the most shocking things in “Never Too Late” is Amber’s admittance that as a young child she “just felt wrong,” and was already battling depression before she could comprehend what it was which eventually led to a suicide attempt when she was only 11 years. “No one was home when I did it. I just took a cord into the bathroom and hung it on the fan in the ceiling, and I looped it around my neck […] I just leaned into it and picked up my feet. It’s so hazy that I only remember certain details, like feeling tons of pressure behind my ears and then waking up on the floor. […] I didn’t try again, I just kind of chalked it up to a failure. And I couldn’t get the fan back up right because the screw was stripped, so after that it was always kind of messed up and made this weird sound when it was on.” She went on to add that every day she would notice that sound and would “have to remember what I’d done that day.”  3  13. Gary  In their episode of 16 & Pregnant, Amber gives a quick recap of her relationship with Gary, but in the book she gives a better explanation of how they met. Although she knew he was her older brother Shawn’s friend, the first she ever saw Gary was in the school library. Amber remembers being sent there to catch up on homework and a senior class was in there, including Gary who, according to her, “was freaking huge.” “I didn’t even see his face, but I remember thinking to myself, ‘Oh my god, this guy is huge. He’s gotta be the biggest guy in the school.'” Then, only one week later, the two were finally introduced when Amber was home sick from school and Shawn and Gary came over. Interestingly, Amber makes a point of never saying Gary’s name in her book — she calls him “future-fiance,” “fiance,” and then “ex-fiance,” or simply refers to him as “Leah’s father.”  4  12. Early Relationship  Eventually, something blossomed between the two when Gary called the house looking for Shawn, but Shawn was at work. Little did Amber know, Gary was the one who had taken Shawn to work and knew exactly where he was, he just needed an excuse to call and strike up a conversation with Amber. The most shocking part is how she talks about Gary in this part. The two have been down a very rough and difficult road, and it seems fans never got a true sense of how in love they once were. “He played the guitar for me. I love a man with a guitar, but he was very, very good. He’s probably the best guitar player out of any of the guys I’ve been around. The way he plays is just so gentle, and he has a beautiful singing voice. […] We had something special.” It is interesting for fans to see Amber talking about Gary that way and revealing his secret talent, and she also went on to reveal that the pair were both virgins before getting together.  5  11. Telling Her Parents  After Gary and Amber had been on and off for three years, things were looking good for the pair, Gary was working really hard to become a nurse’s assistant and Amber was on her way to a management position at Wendy’s, but then she found out she was pregnant after taking a pregnancy test in her work’s bathroom. Gary handled the news really well, but then they had to tell her parents. “I called up my mom to have her come over so I could tell her what was up. I think it was actually her birthday the day I found out. She came home for five minutes, which was long enough to sit down, hear the news, freak out a little bit, call my dad, and leave with her boyfriend. Pretty smooth, Can’t say I blame her.” Her dad didn’t handle it well either: “I’ll never forget his reaction. He was so pissed he just slowly turned away and went into the kitchen to get away from us for a minute […] Both of my parents were seriously shocked. They thought I was a virgin. My bad.”  6  10. Fame Changes People  Early on in her pregnancy, Amber heard about MTV’s new show 16 & Pregnant and decided to apply, but had absolutely no idea how it would change her’s, her daughter’s, Gary’s and their family’s lives forever. “We had absolutely no idea the show was going to turn into the huge thing it is today. We [thought] we were going to be on TV for a little while and everyone would forget about us afterwards,” Amber said of getting selected for the show. After describing how hard she and Gary worked together to get ready for Leah, which included getting their own place, she went on to explain that it didn’t take long before the effects of MTV fame became to hit. “All that attention was the last thing we expected. Leah’s dad started getting all of these girls talking to him. I don’t know how many times I saw messages on his account from girls, risque pictures from all these randos, and him writing back saying, ‘ooh, sexy’ and things like that.” She added, “It started out slow but we would end up losing ourselves in the money and that weird kind of fame we had landed in. Leah’s dad wound up becoming someone who was far, far away from the person he used to be in my memory.”  7  9. Pill Abuse  Long before her pregnancy, before Gary, but also throughout their relationship, Amber began using pills as her party substance. Although she stopped using pills when she found out she was pregnant, it didn’t take long for the addiction to take over. “For six months after she was born, I stayed sober. But I was already reaching my limit with unhappiness and stress, and I was almost begging for something to come along and offer me a way of escape.” Amber then got a Klonopin prescription for her anxiety. “But almost right away, I started eating them all up, and that was the beginning of me becoming an addict.” Shortly after getting the prescription, MTV producers came by to reveal Amber had been picked to star on Teen Mom. “I was so blissed out on my new pills I had to think kind of carefully about how to say ‘Yayyy… woohoo.'”  8  8. Valentine’s Day – Cheating  As their fame increased with filming for Teen Mom, and Amber’s addiction got worse, Gary and Amber’s relationship started to break down even more, and it was on Valentine’s Days she found out he was messing around with other girls. Gary left Amber to go to the mall because he hadn’t had the chance to get anything for her for Valentine’s Day yet. After he was gone for many hours, she called him, and heard girls in the background. Gary said he met them at the mall and gave them a ride home, and it turned into a huge fight which continued when he got home, and he left again to go stay with his mom. “Before long, he called me up crying, or at least acting like he was crying, and saying he had something to tell me. ‘I cheated on you.’ Those weren’t girls he just picked up at the mall. He didn’t even go to the mall to get me a present for Valentine’s Day. He went to hang out with those girls because he was messing around with one of them […] Nothing between us was ever the same after that…I look back on that day as the day everything completely changed.”  9  7. Fighting and The Other Girl  Fans of Teen Mom OG who have followed Amber and Gary’s story know that the one defining moment out of it all was when their fights turned physical, and Amber actually hit Gary. In the book, she delves into how things got so bad and the behind-the-scenes information that got them to that destructive point. Amber reveals in the book that the girl Gary had cheated on her with actually appeared on the show. “The whole thing was kept under wraps. He actually filmed with this girl one time, and people who were watching didn’t realize he’d cheated on me with her. It was kept covered up for a long time.” Despite all of this, Amber really wanted things to work out with Gary, and she describes a nice night the two had that quickly went bad. “I got up and sort of quietly went down the hallway to listen. And there he was, on the phone, talking to this girl. In my freaking house, he was sitting there talking to the girl he cheated with.” She added, “I know people might think they know how bad it was from that they saw, but what was inside our world, what we did keep from showing other people, was even worse. There were times we’d physically fight, both of us. He’d spit on my face and I’d spit back in his face.”  10  6. Signing Over Custody  After the fight, Amber’s downward spiral continued, but it was signing over custody of Leah to Gary that drove her deeper into a mess of depression, anxiety and self-medicating with pills. “I can tell you that the day I signed over custody rights to Leah’s father was the day I completely broke […] Everything that happened around that time is a complete jumble, because after I lost Leah I literally went insane.” Afterwards, Amber attempted suicide for the second time in her life. “I went into the bathroom of my house and tried to hang myself. Before I did it, I called up Leah’s dad and told him I love him […] I took a bunch of pills and tried to get a rope around my neck. I can’t even remember clearly exactly what I did. When the police came, I was unconscious, just moaning.” Ten days later she headed for her rehab trip to Malbu, Califronia which was documented by Teen Mom.  11  5. Sex Addiction  One of the most shocking parts of Amber’s recollection is what happened in her life between signing over custody and her trip to rehab. “It was a bad time. I started going out, fighting, and partying […] I finally got to a place where the attention and money started getting to me, too.” “I was always extreme when it came to partying and sex. When it really got down to it, my life at that time was nothing but pills and men […] Looking back I think it’s obvious I had a bad sex addiction along with the pill addiction.” She explained, “I used to get into fights with boyfriends over how much sex I wanted. If they weren’t in the mood or they were too tired, I would go off. How insane is that?” Amber also revealed that the whole time Gary was trying to get her back and he “would come over and dig through my trash can for condoms, even though we were completely broken up.”  12  4. Partying with Paparazzi  As Amber’s reputation as a partier began to precede her, she wound up in some interesting situations which MTV crews never documented, one of which was crazy nights she had partying with paparazzi. “I was pretty good at avoiding them, usually. I’d just sneak in and out of my house through the back. But there was one time when I’d just gotten out of the shower and I heard a knock on the door. I went and answered in a towel, and so of course there were four guys standing there. One of them was a guy from a pretty well-known publication who said he’d heard I could party […] so I went along and partied with him at the hotel where they were staying. You think teenaged reality TV stars are crazy? Well, listen up: paparazzi are crazy.” “We went to the hotel and stayed the whole night hanging out and partying. There were people there who were trading pills and getting all messed up. We got crazy in the hot tub, rocking out and acting wild, and early in the morning we went back out and these guys stole a bunch of balloons from some store parking lot and handed them to me. There were pictures online of me walking down the street with this big bunch of balloons while they were just taking photos of me.”  13  3. Dan  “Never Too Late” makes it quite clear that Teen Mom fans only see a small sliver of the star’s lives, and that is never more evident than when Amber opens up about one of the loves of her life…Dan, who Amber never speaks of now, and fans didn’t even know about. “One night, I dragged my friend Sallie out to this bar called Jimmy’s, and we were talking and drinking and having fun when these two dudes walked in with a girl. One of these guys was f–king hot. He was just chiseled to the core. Like a country boy with the body of a Greek god, I swear to you, and these beautiful blue eyes!” Amber describes how she and this guy, Dan, got together and how amazing everything was. “We ended up getting together and having a beautiful relationship. We were so happy. We never fought. We made love five times a day, whenever we could. It was insane. Perfect, really.” Despite being happy, and even though he was a “good influence,” Amber was already “beyond reach,” and she writes, “The amazing thing about Dan was the he stuck by my side as long as he did. In another life, I think we could have had something special. Unfortunately, we weren’t cut out for making it together in this one.”  14  2. Jail…Twice  One night, Dan found Amber passed out with a bottle of pills beside her and freaked out worrying she had overdosed, but she woke up and reassured him. Unfortunately she wasn’t able to wake up again for her appointment with her probation officer the next morning. Once the probation officer showed up at her house and found Amber’s stash of pills, she was sent to the courthouse where she was sentenced to a jail stint of three months. This also meant a huge withdrawal from her pills. “I weighed about 115 lbs, and every day, about every four to six hours, I was taking eight or ten of my 1o mg Hydros, which is an unholy amount of those to take. Then I was rounding that out with three Klonopins, two Valiums, and a Soma.” Unfortunately after getting out, things arguably got worse for the reality star. Amber started using Fentanyl patches to get high, which are not only dangerous, but don’t show up on regulated drug tests. “I fell in love with those things so hard I became an addict on a completely different level.” After another near death experience because of taking drugs, Amber finally woke up enough to know she had to do something and at her next court date said she wanted jail time.  15  1. The Last Straw  Amber’s description of her time in prison is one of both hardship, but also success. She achieved things in prison that never would have happened had she continued on the path she was on with pills and partying. As it turns out, despite everything they had been through, when Amber was in prison, she and Gary were “working things out.” They decided they were getting together when she got out, and she sent him $1000 to help him get a place for the two of them and Leah. Then, one night, she figured it out that, through everything he was saying, he had a girlfriend. Once again, Amber realized her family with Gary could not be mended, and it was the last time she tried.\",\n",
       " \"Khloe Kardashian is officially not here to take anyone’s shit. And we love her for it.  Yesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a “source” that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she’s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  “Khloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,” the source said. “She does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.”  Two hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: “I can’t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these “sources”? Hummmm.”  In fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?  Khloe still hasn’t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that’s fun…  First she tweeted this last week: “You will never ever regret being kind to someone.”  Then when someone commented, “Unless they're ungrateful for it”, she replied, “Never give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.”  Then yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: “Your mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.”  And then: “Nobody cares about your story until you win. So win.”  Soooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?\",\n",
       " 'CLOSE Barbara Pierce Bush, the former first lady, died at her Houston home Tuesday after a long struggle with congestive heart failure and pulmonary disease. The down-to-earth matriarch who saw both her husband and son win the White House, was 92. USA TODAY  Former first lady Barbara Bush (Photo: Tom Pennington, Getty Images)  Former first lady Barbara Bush, the wife of one president and mother of another, died Tuesday after deciding to discontinue medical treatment for her declining health.  Family spokesman Jim McGrath announced her death on Twitter at 6:37 p.m. CT: \"A former first lady of the United States of America and relentless proponent of family literacy, Barbara Pierce Bush passed away Tuesday, April 17, 2018 at the age of 92.\"  Bush had made the decision to discontinue medical treatment for congestive heart failure and lung disease after consulting with her family and friends, McGrath announced Sunday. \"It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face off her failing health, worrying not for herself – thanks to her abiding faith – but for others,\" he said.  With her iconic gray hair, quick wit and devotion to her husband of more than 70 years, she became the matriarch of one of the most influential political families of modern times.  Her husband George H.W. Bush, the nation’s 41st president from 1989-93, is now 93 years old and struggling with a Parkinson’s-like disease that forces him to use a wheelchair and has made it difficult for him to speak.  Her eldest son George W. Bush, now 71 and the nation\\'s 43rd president, served two terms from 2001-09 and retired to Texas. His election made Barbara Bush the second woman in history to be both a wife and mother of presidents — and the only one who lived to see both of them serve.  \"My dear mother has passed on at age 92,\" her president-son said in a statement. \"Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was.\"  \"Barbara Bush was a fabulous first lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions. To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I’m a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother,\" he said.  Obituary: Barbara Bush, former first lady and matriarch of Bush family, dies at 92  As recently as 2014, Bush was tied with Hillary Clinton as the most popular first lady of the past 25 years, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found.  The Clintons remembered Bush Tuesday as a woman of \"grit and grace, brains and beauty.\"  \"She was fierce and feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes,\" former president Bill Clinton said in a statement. \"She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Hillary and I mourn her passing and bless her memory.\"  Throughout a long life in the public eye, Bush was a fierce advocate for her husband and sons, including former Florida governor and presidential candidate Jeb Bush.  She also defended them against detractors, from those who criticized her husband\\'s decision to raise taxes in 1990 to those who opposed her son\\'s decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003.  Bush championed the issue of literacy before, during and after her White House years. She formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to fund programs that teach parents in low-income families to read and pass on a love of reading to their children.  \"If everyone could read and write, all the problems I worried about could be solved,\" she told USA TODAY in 2014. \"If you can\\'t read, you can\\'t do anything.\"  President Trump called her \"an advocate for the American family.\"  \"Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection,\" Trump said in a statement through the White House press office. \"She will be long remembered for her strong devotion to country and family, both of which she served unfailingly well \"  He ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff in her honor Saturday when Bush is to be buried at her husband\\'s presidential library in College Station, Texas.  Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen sent their \"deepest sympathies,\" calling Bush \"a woman of unique strength and grace whose devotion to her family was an inspiration to every American.\"  In her own words: Barbara Bush, from political prognostication to \\'rhymes with rich\\'  Her nickname, \"the Silver Fox,\" hinted at both her grandmotherly image but also her behind-the-scenes power as an enforcer of family discipline.  “It’s cliché, but not an exaggeration, to say Barbara Bush was the bulwark and foundation for the whole family,\" said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. \"She was the emotional core and the moral core. The family centered around her. The family may have worked through the achievements of the two President Bushes, but in a real sense it was built around her.\"  She was 63 years old when her husband became president — the second-oldest first lady in history.  In recent years, her health deteriorated along with her husband\\'s. Both were hospitalized simultaneously – Mrs. Bush with \"fatigue and coughing\" – in the days leading up to President Trump\\'s inauguration last year and were unable to attend.  Just this month, the former first lady wrote about her husband in a note for the spring edition of Smith College\\'s alumnae magazine.  \"I am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago,\" she wrote in the life updates section for the magazine.  A love story: Barbara Bush was \\'still in love with the man I married 72 years ago\\'  Bush also revealed her secret for a long life: medical attention.  \"I have had great medical care and more operations than you would believe,\" she told the magazine. \"I\\'m not sure God will recognize me; I have so many new body parts!\"  She continued: \"Also, George Bush has given me the world. He is the best — thoughtful and loving.\"  The couple met at a Christmas dance in 1941, when Barbara Pierce was 16 and George Bush was 17. They got engaged right before he left to fight in World War II as a Navy pilot. After he returned on leave, she dropped out of Smith College, and the two married in January 1945.  Smith College awarded Barbara Bush with an honorary degree in 1989.  More: Barbara Bush dies: President Trump and wife Melania praise former first lady  More: George W.

       " 'Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. \\x93I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm,\\x94 he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable woman\\x97a former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson script\\x97a bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. \\x93I was telling one of my buddies up there, \\x91You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, \\x91Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’\\x94 Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. \\x93And then he says, \\x91Thompson, you got it all covered.’\\x94 Everyone laughs.Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. \\x93We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.\\x94Someone shouts \\x93Go, Fred, go.\\x94Now it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. \\x93People talk about the last election. They say, \\x91The war, the war, the war,’\\x94 Thompson says with a sigh. \\x93I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.\\x94A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. \\x93Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues.\\x94 The applause builds to a standing ovation. \\x93You know, I had another comment or two,\\x94 Thompson says, \\x93but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.\\x94Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. \\x93You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete,\\x94 Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. \\x93Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year.\\x94 Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.',\n",
       " 'The most recent cover of The National Enquirer features a photograph of George Michael. He looks to be lying down with his eyes, closed, and the cover reads, “George Michael THE LAST PHOTO!” It also says “Pop Icon’s Suicide Note Found.” The problem is that this isn’t actually how the photo was taken. Our cousin site Gossip Cop, who has been busting bad dish for years writes, “This is a blatant manipulation. In actuality, the publication took a grainy, previously published paparazzi photo of Michael and rotated it 45 degrees. As a result, it appears as if Michael is laying dead, when in reality, he was upright at a dinner party when the picture was taken.”  Gossip Cop notes that ” The National Enquirer doesn’t explicitly say it is a ‘death photo,’ but that certainly seems to be the implication by the way it is abnormally featured.”  Additionally, the “suicide note” mentioned on the cover isn’t actually a suicide note at all. Instead, the tabloid put together “words from a series of interviews” that he gave long before he died. Within the article, the magazine admits that the photo was taken two months before he died, which Gossip Cop says is “likely only done to remove liability and prevent the outlet from getting sued.”  [image: The National Enquirer]  Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com',\n",

(December 2017)  Despite the recent hoopla surrounding this exchange, it isn\\'t *really* about affection or romance, according to Cobb, who sees tapping as a way to signal, \"Hey, we can both relate,\" in lighthearted situations. That said, touching doesn\\'t necessarily happen between any two people: \"There\\'s a level of familiarity, comfort, and likability in touch. Through touch you connect with your partner. You let them know that they’re important to you,\" Cobb says. \"Gentle touches, playful moments, and sincere smiles show that they enjoy each other’s company and have fun together.\"  3. When They Walked Arm-in-Arm  The couple walks together after a rowing race in Germany.

Because Kate walks slightly ahead of William in this photo, it\\'s a sign that she may be a dominant force in their relationship, according to Cobb.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  4. When They Stood in the Stands  The couple holds horns while watching the London Marathon.

When William Wrapped His Arms Around Kate  William embraces Kate during London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  \"You can get a temperature reading of how hot a couple is for one another by their physical proximity and the level of touch,\" Cobb says. Although this doesn\\'t appear to be an intimate moment, since Kate and William aren\\'t locking eyes, \"they’re seizing the moment with physical closeness that brings them closer emotionally,\" Cobb says.  6. When Kate Draped Her Arms Around William  The couple embraces during the London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  Cobb isn\\'t concerned that the couples\\' eyes don\\'t meet during this embrace, since they\\'re watching a sports game. \"Her hands are relaxed on his shoulders, they\\'re standing body-to-body with no air between them, and while his hands fall away from her a little, his fingers look relaxed with no tightness,\" Cobb says. \"They are very relaxed and comfortable expressing themselves the best way they can, as royals.\"  Cobb thinks nothing of the way Kate is tilting her hips away from William in the photo above, in part because it\\'s difficult to determine how much room Kate had to shift around in the stands. And because Kate and William tend to act demure around each other, facing each other, hip-to-hip, would seem out of character for them, anyway.  7. When Kate Air Kisses William  Kate kisses William on both cheeks after his polo team wins a competition (July 2011). Samir Hussein / Getty Images  Kate and William rarely kiss in public, and this cheek kiss would be a rare exception — except that Kate doesn\\'t actually touch her lips to William\\'s face. \"You can\\'t say she doesn\\'t feel emotion for her husband,\" Cobb says. \"There\\'s still no tension here. Kate is reaching out to him, has a relaxed bend in her arm, with her fingers relaxed on shoulder.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  William, on the other hand, looks less comfortable receiving affection in this context. \"He\\'s body blocking by holding the gift between them,\" Cobb says, although this doesn\\'t mean these partners don\\'t show fondness toward each other. \"It could be that this is the extent of affection they\\'re willing to demonstrate in public.\"  8. When They Were Young  The couple poses for photo on the day of their university graduation. (June 2005) Middleton Family/Clarence House via GettyImages  \"Putting your hand on someone\\'s stomach is more intimate than placing it on the shoulder or back,\" Cobb says. \"Although it\\'s unclear whether William is trying to hold Kate\\'s hand there or move it away, there\\'s no curvature to his fingers, which means there no tension. He\\'s most likely holding Kate\\'s hand in place — a sign of mutual comfort.\"  9. When Kate and William Lean In  The couple sits side by side during a graduation ceremony. (October 2018) ARTHUR EDWARDS/AFP/Getty Images  \"Legs can be used as a psychological barrier expressing interest, disinterest, or discomfort,\" Cobb says of decoding lower-body language. \"William crossing his right leg toward Kate allows her into his space, so he\\'s emotionally drawing her in.\"  Kate leaning toward William suggests she\\'s equally into him. \"We move toward things we like and are attracted to,\" Cobb says.  10. When William Touched Kate\\'s Lower Back  The couple attends media event. (December 2017) Karwai Tang/ Getty Images  \"Couples who love each other want to touch each other, since it can convey your love without you having to say a word,\" Cobb says of William placing his hand on Kate\\'s lower back. \"The back placement is a nice, intimate compromise, since if he goes any lower, he goes near the tush, and the shoulder seems too formal.\"  11. When The Newly Marrieds Kissed On The Buckingham Palace Balcony  The couple kisses on their wedding day. (April 2011)  Cobb says the couple\\'s wedding kiss is the least intimate interaction of them all. \"It was their wedding day! They should have been touching and embracing heart-to-heart,\" she says. Instead, they stand apart, without even holding hands, and reach only their lips toward each other to meet.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  During the kiss, Kate and William open their eyes at different moments before Kate ultimately pulls away. \"It signals a disconnect, since people who are really into each other automatically close their eyes to feel the moment, the breath of the other person, and the sensation of lips touching,\" Cobb says. \"It looks like they\\'re going through the motions. I also get the sense she’s a little shy, embarrassed, or unsure, since she giggles right afterward, and raises her shoulders — it\\'s a nervous moment for her.\" But hey, not everyone gets married in front of thousands of people!  The Bottom Line:  \"This isn\\'t a typical couple, they\\'re people of royalty with rules to follow on public decorum,\" Cobb says. \"I think what happens behind closed doors can be very different from what you see in public.\"  Get all the health and fitness news directly in your feed.

       " 'Actress Meghan Markle was being eyed up by producers as a potential Bond girl before her relationship with Britain\\'s Prince Harry was made public, it has been claimed.  Actress Meghan Markle was being eyed up by producers as a potential Bond girl before her relationship with Britain\\'s Prince Harry was made public, it has been claimed.  Prior to becoming one half of one of the world\\'s most headline-grabbing romances, Meghan was a successful actress, and had roles in movies as well as her long-running part in hit U.S. TV show Suits.  When she confirmed her engagement to Harry, Meghan revealed she would be giving up her acting career to devote all her time to new royal and philanthropic pursuits. But, according to Britain\\'s The Sun newspaper, producers of the James Bond franchise had her in mind for a role in the next 007 film, nicknamed Bond 25, alongside Daniel Craig as the suave spy.  “Meghan fits the role of a Bond girl perfectly. She’s glamorous and sexy and a good actress,\" a source told the publication. \"The role more recently has gone to actresses deemed to be rising stars, and Meghan certainly was seen as that before her relationship with Harry became public.  \"The brief was to find a glamorous rising star, specifically someone American or Canadian.\"  The insider added that Baywatch actress Ilfenesh Hadera, 32, was also on the shortlist last year, alongside Meghan and three other names.  \"But the minute her relationship to Harry came to light they assumed she was out of the running so it soon became a list of four,\" the source added. \"Her engagement effectively spelt an end to her acting career too so that was the final blow.\"  Meghan has just spent Christmas with Harry and his royal relatives at Sandringham House, and will no doubt be seeing in 2018 with her new fiance as well.  In a blog post on her now defunct lifestyle website The Tig back in 2016, Meghan opened up about her New Year\\'s resolutions, and admitted they are the same each and every year.  \"Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing,\" she wrote. \"These make my New Year’s resolution list nearly (AKA actually every) single year. The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple drinks. And when it comes to the biting of the nails – well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day.  \"It’s unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing.

       " 'January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure you’ve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies. Some people, unfortunately, have even had to experience it first-hand, just like Jennifer and her family.Please share this story to remind any and all that alcohol and driving are a combination that never belong together. Hopefully, by doing so, we can prevent acts like tragedy occurring in the future.',\n",
       " 'If you\\'re the type that sits indoors for an entire weekend till you\\'ve finished a whole season of your favorite show, then it\\'s been over a year since you last saw the finale of Orange Is the New Black. Even if you have an excellent memory, there\\'s been a lot of television since then — an entire season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, etc. — plus more actual news than any one human can keep up with day to day. Here, a quick refresher on season five to catch you up before season six debuts on July 27.  Where the Season Started  Season five picked up immediately where season four left off, so just for a minute, think back to 2016. Poussey died during a protest in the cafeteria, when CO Bayley restrained her with a chokehold. After Caputo refused to fire Bayley, the inmates decided to riot; season five began with Daya shooting CO Humphrey in the leg. In the first episode, the inmates gained pretty much full control over the prison, and Taystee eventually got Caputo to read a statement about Poussey\\'s death that was then posted to Twitter.  After that initial statement about Poussey, reports about the riot continued to leak out. Remember celebrity chef Judy King? She was still an inmate at Litchfield when the riot started, and after a news camera caught her tied up on the roof (some of the other inmates were trying to find her stash of food), some outlets mistakenly reported that there had been anti-Christian attacks within the prison. Meanwhile, most of the guards were held captive in an office in the sleeping area, and various inmates took turns making sure they didn\\'t escape.  Frieda in her bunker. Netflix  While most of the prisoners stayed within their usual confines, Frieda retreated to a \"bunker\" she built in an abandoned swimming pool that was supposed to have been filled in by Figueroa. Eventually, Gina, Yoga Jones, and Anita joined her there, with later appearances by Piper, Alex, Red, and several others.  Where the Season Ended  As the riot gained outside media attention, MCC tried to negotiate with the inmates for the release of the COs, with Taystee acting as an advocate for the rights of the prisoners. Gloria also wanted to end the standoff so she could get out and see her son in the hospital, and smuggled the guards out. The guards then escaped via a hole in the fence, meaning Taystee\\'s negotiations were all for nothing. An emergency team then swarmed the prison in riot gear, and many of the inmates, including Flaca and Maritza, were led outside in handcuffs.  Netflix  The team then realized that they were still 10 inmates short, but these inmates were the ones inside the pool bunker: Piper, Red, Alex, Taystee, Cindy, Suzanne, Blanca, Gloria, Nicky, and Frieda. Before the riot team broke into the bunker, though, one major thing happened. Piscatella, who\\'d been tied up by Frieda and then set free by Red, died after another officer shot him by accident. Though a superior officer knew that it was a response team member who did it, it\\'s not yet clear whether one of the inmates will be blamed for the death.  Lingering Questions  1. Where is Alex? Though Alex was with the bunker crew in the finale, she\\'s not visible in the season six trailer and Piper wonders aloud where she is. Does this mean she didn\\'t end up in maximum security with the rest of the inmates? Or is she just being held in solitary where they can\\'t see her?  2. Are all of the inmates in the same place? The finale saw the inmates being loaded onto different buses, with Flaca and Maritza getting separated. Were those buses headed to different prisons, or did they all end up at Litchfield Max?  Netflix  3. Will Morello have her baby? Morello found out in season five that she was expecting a child with her husband Vincent, but we don\\'t really know how far along she is or how much time will pass in season six, so it\\'s possible she could have the baby in one of the coming episodes.  4. How did Pennsatucky get caught? Though Pennsatucky was last seen in the CO cabins, she\\'s definitely back in prison in the trailer for season six. Who put her back?  5. Did Chang escape? Chang also ran away during the riot, but unlike Pennsatucky, she\\'s not in the trailer. Does this mean she escaped Litchfield for good?  Chang contemplates her escape. Netflix  6. Who will take the fall for the riot? Almost everyone in the prison participated in the riot in some way or another, but there are a couple of major crimes that investigators will be looking to solve; those are also the ones that could end with certain inmates having years added to their sentences. Based on the trailer for season six, it\\'s anyone\\'s guess who\\'ll end up in trouble, but for now, no one is safe.

       " 'Koko, Dr. Francine Patterson, and a kitten.  Koko, the gorilla who achieved worldwide fame and adoration after mastering sign language, died in her sleep on Tuesday. She was 46.  A western lowland gorilla, Koko was born at the San Francisco Zoo in 1971. In 1974, animal psychologist Dr. Francine Patterson began to teach her sign language for a Stanford University project. Over time, she learned to sign over 1,000 words and is believed to have understood over 2,000 spoken English words.  Along with her impressive communication skills, she learned how to play the recorder and had a particular affinity for kittens.

       " 'Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model and actress. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that has led to roles in television and film, and work as a spokesperson.  Early life [ edit ]  Cynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of John Daniel Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]  In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modelling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week\\'s coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford\\'s first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management\\'s Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.  Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one semester. She dropped out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]  Career [ edit ]  During the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper\\'s Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Hervé Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy\\'s).  In 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael\\'s hit \"Freedom \\'90\" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of \"Please Come Home For Christmas\", \"John Taylor\" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran\\'s \"Girl Panic\" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift\\'s \"Bad Blood\" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).  The red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.  The inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]  Crawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36\".[17] Crawford\\'s trademark is a mole (or \"beauty mark\") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she \"licked off\" her own mole.[18] During the beginning of her career, the mole was removed from her modeling pictures, including her first Vogue cover.[citation needed] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as \"Baby Gia\".[19][20]  Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host of MTV\\'s House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi\\'s Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented \"In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.\"[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford\\'s acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards - Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]  In July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]  Crawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world\\'s sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy\\'s list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1\\'s 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\" by Men\\'s Health.[29]  Fashion designer Michael Kors summed up her impact:  “ Cindy changed the perception of the \"sexy American girl\" from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with brains, charm, and professionalism to spare.[30] ”  After modeling [ edit ]  Crawford in October 2009  Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. She continues to provide celebrity endorsement for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[31] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[32]  In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the \"Cindy Crawford Home Collection\" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[33] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[34]  In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[35]  Crawford returned to modeling in May 2011, appearing on the cover of the May 2011 issue of Vogue Mexico.[36]  Becoming, a book about Crawford\\'s life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O\\'Leary, was published in September 2015.[37]  Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[38] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[39]  In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[40]  Personal life [ edit ]  Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 to 1995. After they divorced, she married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998.[41] They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999)[42] and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001).[2][43] Both of her children went into modeling.[44][45]  Activism and charity work [ edit ]  When Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff—whom she continues to praise as \"the fourth most influential person in [her] life\"—died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research.[46] Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible.[47] She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.[48]  In 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC.[49] Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.[50]  Political endorsements [ edit ]  In 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. In 2011, she endorsed Mitt Romney.[51]  Filmography [ edit ]  Films [ edit ]  Videos [ edit ]  Fitness videos [ edit ]  Year Title 1992 Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body Workout 1993 Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge Workout 2000 Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension 2001 Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits  Music videos [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]',\n",

Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian were widely panned on Khloe’s Instagram account after posting the pictures of the trio in the coats on a trip to Cleveland.  Mix tape dropping in 2018 A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Apr 10, 2017 at 6:53pm PDT  Studio vibes! We dropping soon! About to be crazy! A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on Apr 10, 2017 at 8:13pm PDT  It is not known if the coats are real of fake fur but Khole appeared to make no attempt to correct users criticising them for their controversial fashion choice.  Chloe Lattanzi was particularly upset.  Olivia Newton-John’s daughter reposted a pic of Kourtney in a white coat with a drink in hand.  RELATED: Kardashian ‘knew OJ was guilty’  Khloe previously declared she would never wear fur despite dropping her support for animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.  Khloe had been an ambassador for PETA and featured on billboards for the organisation.  However she cut ties to the group in 2012, when she discovered they were linked to a woman who attacked Kim with a flour bomb.  Blac Chyna Banned From Using \\'Kardashian\\' Name Professionally 1:02 Blac Chyna has reportedly been banned from using the \"Kardashian\" name professionally. Ref: SPL1473126 030417 Video by: SNTV / Splash News  Khloe released a statement at the time.  “Hi dolls. I’m sure you all heard what happened to Kim last week (thank you SO much for the love and support you all showed her), and I just received word that the woman responsible has very close ties to PETA, despite PETA publicly stating otherwise,” the statement read.  “Not only has PETA lied to the public, but they have proved that they support this kind of behaviour.  “I’ve been a vocal supporter of PETA for a long time but I have also been very vocal about anti-bullying, so this was a huge disappointment for me.  “As you all know, I don’t condone violence and bullying and what happened last Thursday was just that.  “I am absolutely disgusted by their behaviour. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions — I personally don’t wear fur but that doesn’t mean I am going to force my views on anyone else, ESPECIALLY by violating them.  “I am a very proud sister right now, because Kim handled last week’s incident like a champ. She got cleaned up and was back out there in a matter of minutes. Go Kimmie!  “We all need to practice what we preach. I will still continue to NOT wear fur, but I will no longer support PETA. Bullying and harassment is NEVER a solution, and I won’t be a part of any organisation that thinks otherwise.”',\n",

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The pictures of Pall’s apparent indiscretion were captured at a residential location by CCTV and posted to Woodward’s Instagram Stories in a series of snaps — each with a series of savage messages thrown his way.  “Alex is disgusting. Men are trash. Don’t ever forget it,” Woodward wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Woodward later accused Pall of reporting to Instagram after it was deleted by the social network site.  “They’ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you. Then destroy you without a second thought,” she captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, kissing the mystery woman.  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Reps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment about the incident, but Woodward — who has dated Pall since February 2014 — claimed this wasn’t the first time he had been unfaithful throughout their long relationship.  “After hours of begging him for scraps of honesty, I chipped away just enough to confirm that this is not the first time he’s remorsely [sic] cheated on me,” she wrote in another post, listing some of the other women she had questioned him about. “That ‘psycho bitch’ from Vegas, the ‘lame Instagram model’ caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.”  According to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the infidelity but didn’t apologize.  “Consistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it’s not that bad. And in different words, that because he’s famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,” she said. “What’s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN’T EVEN APOLOGIZED.”  “What he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he’s done,” she claimed. ” ‘You’re better than this.’ That’s right I am, but you’re not.”  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Woodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message’s end, writing, “if there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it’s now.”  “Don’t be that guy. Don’t let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,” she said.  She concluded her message by thanking her 40K followers for supporting her in her battle.  “I really appreciate all the kind messages I’ve been getting,” she wrote. “I’m moving on with my life now with the satisfaction that I’m liberated from a horrible person and encourage anyone else in a similar position to know your worth and do the same.”  RELATED VIDEO: Singer/Songwriter Emily Warren on How the Chainsmokers Handle Criticism: ‘It’s Hard [To Not] Get Beat Down by It’  The Chainsmokers, which is made up of Pall and Andrew Taggart, formed in 2012 and went on to find viral success with their 2014 tune “#Selfie.”  Their second EP, 2016’s Collage, brought them into the history books — its single, “Closer,” becoming the longest-running No. 1 hit in the United States in 2016.

       " 'American actress  Sarah Michelle Gellar[2][3] (born April 14, 1977)[4] is an American actress, producer, and entrepreneur. After being spotted by an agent at the age of four in New York City, she made her acting debut in the made-for-television film An Invasion of Privacy (1983). Her television breakthrough came in 1993, when she originated the role of Kendall Hart on the ABC daytime soap opera All My Children, winning the 1995 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series.  Gellar received widespread recognition for her portrayal of Buffy Summers on the WB series Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997–2003), which earned her five Teen Choice Awards and a Golden Globe Award nomination, and became recognized as one of the greatest female characters in U.S. television.[5][6] Her most successful films, in terms of box office receipts, are I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Scream 2 (1997), Cruel Intentions (1999), Scooby-Doo (2002), Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), and The Grudge (2004).[7] Other film roles include Harvard Man (2001), Southland Tales (2007) and The Air I Breathe (2008). She headlined the television series Ringer (2011–2012) and The Crazy Ones (2013–2014).  In 2015, Gellar, along with Galit Laibow and Greg Fleishman, founded Foodstirs, a food crafting brand and e-commerce startup selling baking kits,[8] and in 2017, she released her cook book Stirring Up Fun with Food.  Family and education [ edit ]  Gellar was born in Long Island. She is the only child of Rosellen (née Greenfield), a nursery school teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a garment worker.[9] Both of her parents were Jewish, though Gellar\\'s family also had a Christmas tree during her childhood.[10][11] In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on the city\\'s Upper East Side.[12] While growing up with her mother, she lost contact with her father, from whom she remained estranged until his death in 2001;[13][14][15] she once described him as \"non-existent\",[16] and in the early 2000s, she stated: \"My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I\\'m not being deliberately evasive about him, it\\'s just that there\\'s so little to say.\"[15][17][18] Besides being a working child at the time, Gellar was a competitive figure skater, finishing in third place at a New York State regional competition.[3] She also placed fourth at a Tae Kwon Do competition at Madison Square Garden (she was a black belt).[3]  Gellar was given a partial scholarship to study at the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School,[3][19] as her mother was not able to pay full tuition, for which she was constantly bullied.[20] She said in an interview with The Independent: \"I was different and that\\'s the one thing you can\\'t be at school, because you\\'re ostracised. I didn\\'t have the money these kids had\".[21] Gellar was not present in class for most of the time at the school as she had to work in several acting projects simultaneously, recalling that she \"had more absences in the first month than you\\'re supposed to have for an entire year. I was telling them that I had back problems and had to go to the doctor the whole time\".[3] Gellar then briefly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, but dropped out due to acting obligations; the teachers threatened to fail her because of her constant absence from classes as she was busy going to auditions, despite earning good grades.[3] Gellar graduated from the Professional Children\\'s School,[3][22][23] in 1994 as a \"straight A\" student with a 4.0 grade average.[24][25][26] As Gellar spent significant time working on All My Children while \"trying to graduate\",[27] the majority of her senior year was completed through guided study.[28]  Career [ edit ]  Early credits and prominence (1981–1996) [ edit ]  At the age of four, she was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Upper Manhattan.[29] Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in the television film An Invasion of Privacy, with Valerie Harper, Carol Kane and Jeff Daniels. At the audition, Gellar read both her own lines and those of Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role.[3] The film aired on CBS in January 1983.[30] She subsequently appeared in a controversial television commercial for Burger King, in which her character criticized McDonald\\'s and claimed to eat only at Burger King.[31] The ad led to a lawsuit by McDonald\\'s, naming Gellar and banning her from eating at the food chain;[32][33] she recalled in a 2004 interview: \"I wasn’t allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you’re a little kid, McDonald’s is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies.\"[34][35] While growing up, Gellar also worked as a model for Wilhemina and acted in numerous television commercials.[3][36]  During the 1980s, Gellar played minor roles in the films Over the Brooklyn Bridge (1984), Funny Farm (1988) and High Stakes (1989),[37][38][39] and also guest starred in various television series, such as Spenser: For Hire and Crossbow. At the age of nine, she appeared alongside Matthew Broderick and Eric Stoltz in the Broadway production The Widow Claire.[3][40][41] She served briefly as a co-host of the teen girl talk show Girl Talk, which aired in 1989.[42] In 1991, she was cast as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in A Woman Named Jackie, starring Roma Downey. The miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.  Gellar next took on the leading role in the 1992 syndicated teen serial Swans Crossing, which chronicled the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers. The series ran for one season and earned Gellar two Young Artist Award nominations, for Best Young Actress in a New Television Series and for Best Young Actress in an Off-Primetime Series.[43] She made her debut in the soap opera All My Children in 1993, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). As she got the role, Gellar was complimented as having the acting talent and the \"forceful personality\" needed to go up against Lucci\\'s experience; Kendall was supposed to be like a younger version of Erica.[44] Her stint on the show was successful as \"longtime fans of the soap saw her as the second coming of Erica\".[45] Writers showcased her more after her initial reception and she became a household name to the soap opera medium.[45] In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role.[46] The same year, Gellar left the show to pursue other acting opportunities.[47][48]  Worldwide recognition (1997–2003) [ edit ]  Gellar moved to Los Angeles following her departure from All My Children, and in 1996, she read the script for Joss Whedon\\'s television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which follows Buffy Summers, a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting occult foes and supernatural occurrences. She screen tested several times originally for the role of Cordelia Chase,[49] but after approaching Whedon and producers about playing Buffy Summers, she auditioned again and was eventually cast in the title role.[3][50] The show premiered in March 1997, to widespread critical and popular acclaim,[51] and Gellar\\'s Buffy, created to subvert the stereotypical female horror movie victim,[52] went on to become recognized as one of the 100 greatest female characters in U.S. television.[5][6] Buffy ran for seven seasons (144 episodes),[53][54] and during its broadcast, earned Gellar five Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.[55] She sang during the series\\' musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\", which spawned an original cast album, released in 2002.[56][57]  During the early airing of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar made her first major film appeareances in two successful slasher films. In I Know What You Did Last Summer, opposite Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ryan Phillippe and Freddie Prinze, Jr, she took on the role of an ill-fated aspiring beauty actress.[58] Budgeted at US$17 million, the movie made US$125 million globally.[59][60][61] Washington Post found the cast to be \"solid\",[62] in what San Francisco Chronicle described as a \"competent but uninspired\" film.[63] For her part, Gellar earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress – Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance.[64][65] In Scream 2 (also 1997),[66] Gellar played a likewise ill-fated vain character, this time that of a Sorority sister. She filmed her scenes in-between shots of Buffy and had only recently finished work on I Know What You Did Last Summer. Despite the hectic scheduling, she agreed to perform in Scream 2 without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film.[67] Scream 2 grossed over US$172 million worldwide.[68][69]  In 1998, Gellar hosted for the first time Saturday Night Live,[70][71] and provided the voice of the Gwendy Doll in Small Soldiers, a moderate commercial success.[72][73] Gellar also had her first appearance on the \\'Most Beautiful\\' list by People magazine, which cemented her \"It girl\" status at the time.[27] In 1999, she had a cameo appearance in the sleeper hit She\\'s All That,[74] and took on the lead role of a struggling restaurant owner in the critically panned romantic comedy Simply Irresistible.[75][76] Gellar once called it \"bad choice\",[77] but Roger Ebert, on the other hand, found her to be \"lovely\" in what he described as an \"old-fashioned\" comedy.[78] In Cruel Intentions (1999), a modern-day retelling of Les Liaisons dangereuses, Gellar played Kathryn Merteuil, a brunette cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating people.[79] The US$10 million film was a hit at the box office, grossing USUS$75 million worldwide.[80][81][82][83][84][85] Roger Ebert felt that she is \"effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp\",[86] and in an interview with Chicago Tribune, director Roger Kumble, describing her work in the movie, said: \"She unquestionably is the most professional actor I ever worked with\".[3] Gellar and co-star Selma Blair obtained the \"Best Kiss\" award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards.[87][88][89] Around that time, she guest starred in three episodes of Angel and appeared as Debbie in the HBO series Sex and the City episode \"Escape from New York\".  Gellar played the daughter of a mobster in James Toback\\'s independent drama Harvard Man,[90] which premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.[91] While the film found a limited release in theaters,[92] Gellar\\'s performance in it, along with Cruel Intentions, helped her shed her good girl image.[93] Gellar portrayed Daphne Blake in the live action–comedy Scooby-Doo, directed by Raja Gosnell and alongside Freddie Prinze, Jr., Linda Cardellini and Matthew Lillard. Scooby-Doo made over US$275 million,[94] and became Gellar\\'s most widely seen film to date.[7][95] She won the Teen Choice Award in the category of Choice Movie Actress – Comedy for her part in the picture.[96] Alongside Jack Black, she hosted the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, which attracted 7.1 million viewers on its June 6 broadcast, achieving the show\\'s highest rating ever at the time.[97][98]  During her growing film career, Gellar continued work on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she left the show after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, \"This isn\\'t about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater – it\\'s more of a personal decision. I need a rest.\"[99][100][101][102] In her feature in Esquire magazine Gellar expressed her pride for her work on Buffy, \"I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don\\'t feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television.\"[103]  Continued film roles (2004–2010) [ edit ]  After the end of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gellar provided her voice for the character Gina Vendetti in The Simpsons episode \"The Wandering Juvie\", which aired in March 2004. Her next film was Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004), reprising the role of Daphne.[104] While IGN felt that both Gellar and Prinze \"exhibit marked improvements over their work in [2002\\'s Scooby-Doo]\",[105] the film was a commercial success, grossing US$181.4 million around the globe.[106] In the horror remake The Grudge (also 2004), Gellar portrayed Karen Davis, an exchange student living and working in Tokyo who becomes exposed to a mysterious supernatural curse. Critic Rob Blackwelder wrote that she \"played her part well, and her fear and disorientation are terrifically enhanced by the decision to keep the [original] setting in this remake\".[107] The film was a major box office hit,[108][109] grossing more than US$110 million in the US, and US$187 million worldwide.[110][111][112] She received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Frightened Performance as well as a nomination for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Thriller for her role.[113][114] Since 2005, she has voiced several characters in 13 episodes of the animated television series Robot Chicken, as of 2018.  Gellar starred opposite Dwayne Johnson, Seann William Scott, and Justin Timberlake in Richard Kelly\\'s Southland Tales (2006), as an adult film star working on creating a reality television show. Gellar had met with Kelly and was drawn to the original ideas for the movie, accepting the role before she even read the script.[115][116][117][118] The film found a limited audience in theaters,[119] but J. Hoberman for Village Voice remarked that the director \"contrives two memorable comic performances\" by Gellar and Johnson. In 2006, Gellar also briefly reprised her role of Karen in the critically panned sequel The Grudge 2,[120][121][122] and starred in the psychological thriller The Return, as a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman.[123] The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only US$11 million.[124][125] The New York Times called it a \"career stagnation\".[126]  In 2007, Gellar voiced Ella in the poorly received animated film Happily N\\'Ever After,[127] and also April O\\'Neil in TMNT, which made US$95 million.[128][129] She starred in the romantic comedy Suburban Girl and the drama The Air I Breathe, both of which were screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[130] In Suburban Girl, alongside Alec Baldwin, she took the role of a New York City editor and the love interest of a much older influential man (Baldwin). The film was released for DVD in January 2008.[131] In the likewise little-seen film The Air I Breathe, Gellar appeared with Forest Whitaker, Brendan Fraser and Kevin Bacon, portraying an up-and-coming pop singer.[132][133] The New York Times called it a \"gangster movie with delusions of grandeur\",[134] while DVD Talk noted that \"her character here has the deepest emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes.\"[135]  Possession, a psycological thriller Gellar filmed in 2006, saw her play a lawyer whose life is thrown into chaos after a car accident sends her husband (Michael Landes) and brother-in-law (Lee Pace) into comas. Due to financial problems at Yari Film Group,[136][137][138] the film went to DVD in March 2010.[139] In the film adaptation Veronika Decides to Die,[140][141] Gellar starred as a young depressed woman who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Like Possession, the film failed to find a proper release in North American theaters, and was released for VOD in 2015.[142][143][144][145] Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found the actress to be \"reasonably compelling\" in what he called a \"ponderous and silly misfire\".[146]  Return to television (2011–present) [ edit ]  Gellar took a two-year hiatus from acting following the birth of her daughter in 2009, and in 2011, she signed to star and work as executive producer for a new drama titled Ringer, in which she played the dual role of twin sisters, one of whom is on the run and manages to hide by assuming the wealthy life of the other. Gellar has stated that part of her decision to return to a television series was because it allowed her to both work and raise her child.[147][148][149] The series received positive reviews from critics;[150] E! Online found her to be \"awesome\" and \"fantastic\",[151] while TV Line felt she \"does a fine job\" as both characters.[152] Ringer went on to have a large fan base,[153][154] but it was canceled after the first season.[155] For her portrayal, she received several award nominations, including one for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Television Actress – Drama.[156][157]  In September 2011, Gellar returned as a guest star on the ABC soap opera All My Children before the show\\'s ending but not as Kendall Hart;[158] she portrayed a patient at Pine Valley Hospital who tells Maria Santos that she is \"Erica Kane\\'s daughter\", and states that she saw vampires before they became trendy—a reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She voiced a character in the American Dad! episode \"Virtual In-Stanity\",[159][160] and again for the December 6, 2012 episode (\"Adventures in Hayleysitting\").[161] On September 30, 2012, she reprised her role of Gina Vendetti in the premiere episode of The Simpsons\\' season 24.[162][163]  A fan of Robin Williams for years, once Gellar learned that he was making the single-camera television series The Crazy Ones, she contacted her friend Sarah de Sa Rego, the wife of Williams\\' best friend, Bobcat Goldthwait, in order to lobby for a co-starring role.[164] She obtained the part of an advertising director who runs an agency with her father.[165][166] Digital Spy felt that Williams \"shares a warm, genuine chemistry with his on-screen offspring Gellar,\"[167] as part of a mixed critical response.[168] Like Ringer, the series was canceled after one season,[169][170] but earned Gellar the People\\'s Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New Television Series.[171]  In March 2015, Gellar guest-starred as Cinderella in Whitney Avalon\\'s official YouTube channel video short Princess Rap Battle,[172] and joined the cast of Star Wars Rebels for season two,[173] playing a recurring character known as the Seventh Sister.[174] In early 2016, Gellar filmed for NBC a pilot presentation for a potential television series based on the cult-classic film, Cruel Intentions, reprising her role of Kathryn Merteuil. The pilot was ultimately not picked up to series.[175][176]  Public image [ edit ]  Wax statue of Sarah Michelle Gellar at Madame Tussauds in London  Gellar has appeared on the covers and photo sessions of numerous magazines during her career. In February 1998, she appeared in Seventeen,[177] and in subsequent years the list has grown to include Nylon, Marie Claire, Vogue, Glamour, Esquire, Allure, Cosmopolitan, FHM, Rolling Stone and Elle among others.[178][179][180][181] In 1999, Gellar signed on to be the face of Maybelline – becoming the company\\'s first celebrity spokeswoman since Lynda Carter in the late 1970s.[182][183] She was honored with a Woman of The Year Award by Glamour magazine in October 2002,[184] and in the same year, her wax figure by Madame Tussauds, was unveiled as part of the \"Trail of Vampires\" exhibition.[185]  With her work in Buffy and mainstream movies such as Cruel Intentions, Gellar became a household name and a sex symbol across the globe, status she cemented with being a feature several times in the annual Maxim \"Hot 100\" list between 2002 and 2008.[186][187][188][189] Wearing a black lace bra, she was on the cover of the December 2007 issue of Maxim and was named the 2009 Woman of the Year by the magazine.[190] She was voted number 1 in FHM\\'s edition of \"100 Sexiest Women\" of 1999, and was featured in its 2005 list.[191] She had also been in the magazine\\'s German, Dutch, South African, Danish and Romanian editions of the 100 Sexiest Women list every year from 1998 onwards.[192] Topsocialite.com listed her as the 8th Sexiest woman of the 90s along with Alicia Silverstone, Gillian Anderson and Shannen Doherty.[193]  She was featured in Google\\'s Top 10 Women Searches of 2002 and 2003, coming in at No. 8,[194] and was included in UK Channel 4\\'s 100 Greatest Sex Symbols in 2007, ranking at No. 16.[195] Other appearances and listings include: Entertainment Weekly ranked her in its Top 100 TV Icons in 2007, and placed her No. 3 in its Top 12 Entertainers of the Year in 1998, and Glamour ranked her in its 50 Best Dressed Women in the World 2004 and 2005 at Nos. 17 and 24, respectively.[192] BuddyTV ranked her No. 27 on TV\\'s 100 Sexiest Women of 2011 list, as well.[196]  She has appeared in \"Got Milk?\" ads as well as in the Stone Temple Pilots music video \"Sour Girl\" and Marcy Playground\\'s \"Comin\\' Up From Behind\".[197][198][199] Gellar was featured on the cover of Gotham and their main story in the March 2008 issue, in which she spoke about how her style has evolved since she passed 30. Gellar said: \"It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30, they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on Letterman, I wore this skintight Herve Leger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it.\"[200]  Other endeavors [ edit ]  Charitable activities [ edit ]  Gellar is an active advocate for various charities, including breast cancer research, Project Angel Food, Habitat for Humanity and CARE. Of her charitable pursuits, she says, \"I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there\\'s ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn\\'t do a lot. I couldn\\'t do much more than just donate money when I was on [Buffy] because there wasn\\'t time. And now that I have the time, it\\'s amazing.\"[201]  In 1999, she went to the Dominican Republic to help Habitat for Humanity\\'s project of building homes for the residents;[3] Gellar recalled in an interview she had worked with the cause a lot, explaining: \"You actually get to physically do something, where you get to go and build these houses. I like working with things where you can directly affect someone in particular\".[201] With Project Angel Food, she delivered healthy meals to people infected with AIDS, and through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, she granted sick children\\'s wishes of meeting her while working on Buffy.[201] In 2007, Gellar was featured in Vaseline\\'s \"Skin Is Amazing\" campaign, with other actors such as Hilary Duff, Amanda Bynes and John Leguizamo.[202] She agreed to auction nude-posed photos of herself on eBay, to raise money for the Coalition of Skin Diseases, an organization which supports clinical research, fosters physician and patient education.[203][204]  In May 2011, Gellar joined \"The Nestlé Share the Joy of Reading Program\", which promotes reading to young children to encourage them to read during the summer break.[205][206] The following year, she was presented with the Tom Mankiewicz Leadership Award during the Beastly Ball at the Los Angeles Zoo.[207] The honor recognizes members of the entertainment community who have excelled in establishing meaningful and lasting programs that contribute to the welfare of the world\\'s natural and civic environment.[208] In 2014 and 2015, Gellar hosted two fundraisers for Mattel Children\\'s Hospital UCLA.[209][210][211]  Foodstirs [ edit ]  In October 2015, Gellar co-founded Foodstirs, a food crafting brand and e-commerce startup selling easy to make and organic baking kits for children and families.[8]  Cook book [ edit ]  Gellar released a cook book titled Stirring up Fun with Food on April 18, 2017. The book was co-authored by Gia Russo, and features numerous food crafting ideas.[212]  Personal life [ edit ]  Gellar met her future husband Freddie Prinze, Jr., while they were filming the 1997 teen horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer,[213] but the two did not begin dating until 2000. They were engaged in April 2001 and married in Mexico on September 1, 2002,[214] in a ceremony officiated by Adam Shankman, a director and choreographer with whom Gellar had worked on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Prinze and Gellar have worked together several times; they played each other\\'s respective love interests as Fred and Daphne in the 2002 film Scooby-Doo and its sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and both provided their voices for the animated feature Happily N\\'Ever After (2007) and the animated series Star Wars Rebels.[215] In 2007, in honor of their fifth year of marriage, Gellar legally changed her name to Sarah Michelle Prinze.[2][3]  Together, Gellar and Prinze have two children, a daughter (Charlotte Grace) born September 2009 and a son (Rocky James) born September 2012.[216][217] The family lives in Los Angeles.[218]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Other works [ edit ]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969) is an American singer, actress, dancer and producer. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez received a Golden Globe nomination and became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.[3]  Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and appeared in Maid in Manhattan.  After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. In 2016, she began starring in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and commenced a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance.  With a cumulative film gross of US$2.9 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, Lopez is regarded as the most influential Latin performer in the United States. In 2012, Forbes ranked her as the most powerful celebrity in the world, as well as the 38th most powerful woman in the world.[4] Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 include: \"If You Had My Love\", \"I\\'m Real\", \"Ain\\'t It Funny\", \"All I Have\", and \"On the Floor\", which is one of the best-selling singles of all time.[5] For her contributions to the music industry, Lopez has received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Billboard Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award among other honors. Her other ventures include clothing lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation. She has been divorced three times and gave birth to twins in 2008 with then-husband Marc Anthony.  Early life  Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in The Bronx borough of New York City, to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez and David López.[6] She has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda, a journalist.[7] David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a homemaker. When Lopez was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.[8] At the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old. Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home—singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\".[9] Lopez spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School.[10] In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level, and was a member of the school\\'s softball team.[11] She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.[9]  While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), a low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.[12] Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez realized that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". To please her parents, though, she enrolled in Baruch College, only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents about her dream of becoming a movie star, but they insisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a Golden Musicals of Broadway, which toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer, and choreographer.[8]  Career  1991–1996: Career beginnings  Lopez was selected as a backup dancer for the New Kids on the Block in 1991 and performed with them during their performance of \"Games\" at the 18th Annual American Music Awards.[13] Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television program In Living Color. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unable to continue with the show. Out of 2,000 applicants, Lopez made it to the finals. She was the runner-up but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved to Los Angeles to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993, when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist Janet Jackson.[14] Lopez was set to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but backed out as she wanted to do her \"own thing\".[15]  Lopez received her first professional acting gig in the direct-to-video drama film Lost in the Wild (1993), co-starring with Lindsay Wagner and Robert Loggia.[16] Later in 1993, Lopez signed a deal with CBS to co-star in the television series Second Chances. Lopez received her first major big-screen role in Gregory Nava\\'s 1995 drama My Family portraying Young Maria.[17] Although her role was uncredited, Lopez received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female nomination for her performance.[17] In November 1995, Lopez starred in Money Train alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson as New York City transit cops. In August 1996, Lopez had a supporting role in the comedy Jack.[18]  1997–1999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6  In February 1997, Lopez starred alongside Jack Nicholson and Stephen Dorff in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine.[19] Lopez starred as the title role of the Selena biopic of the same name in March.[20] Despite having previously worked with the film\\'s director on My Family, Lopez was subjected to an intense auditioning process before she was cast in the film.[21] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated that even in the \"forgettable films\" Money Train, and Jack, Lopez\\'s \"presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom\" and with Selena she\\'s \"seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film\\'s numerous musical numbers\". He concluded by calling the film not just a celebration of Selena\\'s life, but also of the actress who portrayed her.[22] The announcement was described as the \"role of a lifetime.\" from news outlets and Lopez\\'s salary for the film was reported at $1 million,[23][24] which made Lopez the highest-paid Hispanic actress in history. After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish.[25] Lopez\\'s manager then sent the song, titled \"Vivir Sin Ti\" (Living without You), to Sony Music Entertainment\\'s Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead.[26]  In April, Lopez starred in the horror film Anaconda alongside Ice Cube and Jon Voight.[27] Lopez starred alongside Sean Penn and Billy Bob Thornton in the crime film U Turn in October. The film, which is based on the novel Stray Dogs by John Ridley, received somewhat positive reviews from critics.[28] In June, Lopez starred opposite George Clooney in Out of Sight, Steven Soderbergh\\'s adaptation of Elmore Leonard\\'s novel of the same name (1996).[29] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, Lopez won rave reviews for her performance.[30] Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the computer-animated film Antz in October.[31]  Lopez\\'s debut single, \"If You Had My Love\", was released in May 1999, as she began to ready her first album.[32][33] Lopez became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with a debut single since Britney Spears did so with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior.[34] During production of her debut album, On the 6, Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the basis of her looks and an already established name in the entertainment industry, and she wanted to prove she had musical talent.[35] Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\"[36] \"Waiting for Tonight\", the third single from On the 6, is widely considered to be Lopez\\'s best song.[37] Lopez\\'s musical success came as a surprise to critics; its launch made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\".[36] By the end of 1999, Lopez successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.[38] She joined a select few in achieving this feat, becoming the first since Vanessa Williams (1992) and Martika (1989).[34]  2000–2002: Film success, J.Lo and This Is Me... Then  On February 23, 2000, Lopez, accompanied by then boyfriend Sean Combs, wore a plunging exotic green Versace silk chiffon dress on the red carpet of the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards. The dress \"had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again,\" exposing her midriff and then as cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe.[39] The dress generated controversy and media attention, with images of Lopez in the dress being downloaded from the Grammy website over half a million times 24 hours after the event.[40] Lopez was surprised by the enormous media coverage, declaring that she had no idea \"it was going to become such a big deal\".[41] Lopez returned to the big-screen in August, starring in the psychological thriller The Cell opposite Vincent D\\'Onofrio.[42]  During the process of recording her second album, Lopez decided to tweak her image as she began to develop into a sex symbol. She started going by J.Lo, something fans often called her.[43] She subsequently named the album J.Lo. Released on January 23, 2001, it was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200.[44] During the same week, her romantic comedy film The Wedding Planner in which she starred opposite Matthew McConaughey opened atop the box office. This made her the first woman to have a number one film and album simultaneously in the United States.[45] The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, \"Love Don\\'t Cost a Thing\", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart. It was followed by the single \"Play\".[46] In April 2001, Lopez launched J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez, her own clothing and accessory company. Lopez felt that \"the voluptuous woman [was] almost ignored\" in the fashion industry, and therefore her company specialized in clothing women of all shapes.[43] The following month, she starred in the romantic drama film Angel Eyes, which performed disappointingly at the box office and generated mixed reviews.[47] After several months, J.Lo was declining on the charts; this prompted Mottola to recruit rapper Ja Rule to create an urban-oriented remix of the song \"I\\'m Real\". This led to the release of \"I\\'m Real (Murder Remix)\", which quickly reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Its success resulted in J.Lo being reissued to include the single, which was number one in the United States during the week of the September 11 attacks.[46] J.Lo became the best-selling album of Lopez\\'s career, having sold 3.8 million copies in the US and moved over 12 million units worldwide.[48][49]  Having redefined Lopez\\'s sound with \"I\\'m Real (Murder Remix)\", Epic decided to release further remixes in order to \"keep the momentum going\".[50] A remix album entitled J to tha L–O! The Remixes was subsequently released on February 5, 2002. It debuted at the summit of the Billboard 200, making it the first remix album to do so. Its lead single, \"Ain\\'t It Funny (Murder Remix)\", featuring Ja Rule and Caddillac Tah, reached number one in the US.[51] J to tha L–O! The Remixes became one of the best-selling remix albums of all time, selling 1.5 million copies in the US.[52] It produced two more singles: \"I\\'m Gonna Be Alright\" and \"Alive\", a ballad co-written by her husband at the time, Cris Judd. In April 2002, Lopez opened her restaurant, Madrè\\'s.[43] The following month, she starred in the thriller film Enough, which was described by the Boston Herald as a \"kick-but, female empowerment\" film.[53] While filming Enough, which required an overworked Lopez to practice Krav Maga, she suffered a nervous breakdown. She recalled feeling \"sick and weird\", refusing therapeutic help or medication. She confessed, \"I was like – I don\\'t want to move, I don\\'t want to talk, I don\\'t want to do anything.\"[54] In September, she released her first fragrance, Glow by JLo. It performed strongly despite predictions that it would fail, and became the top-selling fragrance in the US.[55]  Lopez\\'s third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released on November 25, 2002. It was dedicated to actor Ben Affleck, her fiancé at the time. The album\\'s lead single \"Jenny from the Block\", was later described by Sam Lansky of MTV News as her most iconic single.[56] In the song, Lopez \"intones her modest childhood roots\".[57] The album itself performed strongly, selling 2.6 million copies in the US.[52] Its second single, \"All I Have\", peaked at number one in the US. That December, Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, which became the highest-grossing film of her career.[58]  2003–2005: Gigli and Rebirth  In August 2003, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli. The film was a box office bomb, and is considered one of the worst films of all time. The film\\'s poor reception was attributed to negative press preceding its release, as well as the media attention surrounding Lopez and Affleck\\'s engagement which largely overshadowed the film.[58][59] Lopez would later describe this as the lowest point of her career, saying \"[It] was very tough\", \"the tabloid press had just come into existence at the time, so I was like a poster child for that moment.\"[60] In October of that year, she released her next fragrance, Still Jennifer Lopez. Lopez also launched her next fashion label, Sweetface. It was described by Andy Hilfiger as a \"more intellectual, more inspirational collection than J-Lo by Jennifer Lopez. Less sporty, more suede.\"[61] Lopez\\'s clothing lines and two fragrances generated over $300 million in revenue throughout 2004, which made her the 19th richest person under 40.[45]  In March 2004, Lopez had a minor role in the film Jersey Girl, alongside Affleck. Her character, Gertrude Steiney, dies during childbirth within the first 15 minutes of the film. From the intense media scrutiny following the couple\\'s break-up, it was noted that \"they may need to put Lopez in a coffin on the poster if they want anyone to come\".[62] In October, Lopez co-starred alongside Richard Gere in the drama Shall We Dance?, a re-make of the 1996 Japanese film of the same title. The film was successful at the box office, and was considered a rebound for Lopez following Gigli.[58]  After placing her career on hiatus, Lopez released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in February 2005. According to Lopez, Rebirth \"came about because I was on such a roller-coaster ride, that was my career from my first album to my last album, and I did a bunch of movie projects in between. I finally took some time just for myself, and [when] I came back, this was the first project I did. I felt like it was a new beginning for me, like I was, in a way, reborn.\"[63] Tracy Hopkins of NBC\\'s Today Music noted that after \"fawning\" over Affleck on This Is Me... Then\", Lopez \"wisely keeps her love life out of the spotlight\" on Rebirth and only references her relationship with Anthony on a few tracks.[64] The album produced the single \"Get Right\", which peaked at number one in the United Kingdom.[65] In May, she starred alongside Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law, for which she received a salary of $15 million.[66] The film\\'s marketing played up Lopez\\'s \"Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image\", and it became a box office success.[58][67] In August, Lopez starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in An Unfinished Life, a drama film based on the novel of the same name.  2006–2009: Career disappointments and Como Ama una Mujer  Lopez in 2008  In April 2006, Lopez reappeared on the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on \"Control Myself\", the lead single from LL Cool J\\'s twelfth studio album Todd Smith. The song peaked at number four on the chart following its release as a music download, making it the pair\\'s second collaboration to reach the top five.[68] Bordertown, a film based on the Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, made its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006. Lopez, who also acts as the film\\'s producer, stars as Lauren Adrian, an American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel who wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war.[69] Bordertown received a direct-to-video release.[58] DanceLife, a reality series following the lives of seven dancers trying to break into the world of professional dance, aired on MTV from January 15 to March 5, 2007. Lopez produced, created and was featured in the show.[70] According to the album\\'s co-producer Estéfano, Lopez\\'s fifth studio album Como Ama una Mujer would \"prove critics wrong\" with its \"big songs that require a voice\"; referring to the criticism of Lopez having a \"limited\" vocal tone. The album\\'s lead single \"Qué Hiciste\" reached number one on Billboard\\'s Hot Latin Songs chart. Lopez performed the song on the sixth season of American Idol on April 11, 2007, becoming the first person to perform a Spanish song on the series.[65] The album received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a debut Spanish album and the highest digital sales.[73][74]  In September 2007, Lopez starred in the biographical film El Cantante, which is based on the life of the late salsa singer Héctor Lavoe. In the film, Lavoe is portrayed by then-husband Marc Anthony while Lopez plays Lavoe\\'s wife Puchi.[75] Lopez revealed that she felt her performance in the film El Cantante should have earned her an Oscar.[76] \"I feel like I had that [Oscar worthy role] in \\'El Cantante,\\' but I don\\'t think the academy members saw it\".[76] El Cantante did not perform well at the box office, earning just $7.6 million.[58] Lopez and Anthony also launched their co-headlining North American concert tour on September 28.[77] Lopez\\'s sixth studio album Brave, released in October, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[78] The album produced two singles, \"Do It Well\" and \"Hold It Don\\'t Drop It\". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to make any significant impact on the charts. A five-part miniseries, Jennifer Lopez Presents: Como Ama una Mujer, based on the lyrics of Como Ama una Mujer aired on Univision from October 30 to November 27, 2007. She placed her career on hiatus after giving birth to twins in February 2008.[79] In late 2009, Lopez released two songs for her seventh studio album, Love? (\"Louboutins\" and \"Fresh Out of the Oven\"); however, the songs failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts which led to her departure from Epic Records.[80]  2010–2012: Career rejuvenation with American Idol and touring  Lopez parted ways with Epic Records in February 2010, citing that she had fulfilled her contractual obligations and now wished to release her seventh studio album Love? under a new label.[81] Her departure from the label temporarily halted production on the album, which commenced in 2009. Upon signing a new contract with Island Records, recording resumed on the album.[82] The New York Daily News revealed that Lopez would be taking some of the records recorded under Sony Music Entertainment to her new label so that they could be included on the album.[83] In April, Lopez starred in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan, her first theatrical role in three years.[79] In June, following the departure of Ellen DeGeneres from American Idol, it was reported that Lopez was in talks to join season ten\\'s judging panel.[84][85][86] During this same time, Lopez and Anthony were being considered for a role on The X Factor for their appeal to Latin and International markets.[87] It was officially announced in September that Lopez would be joining the tenth season of American Idol. MTV stated that the deal was \"mutually beneficial to all those involved\", while CNN reported that Lopez was viewing it as a decision to revive her career, while American Idol producers believed that Lopez and Steven Tyler\\'s appointments would strengthen viewing figures.[88] In October, Lopez released her fourteenth fragrance, Love and Glamour. The perfume was inspired by Lopez\\'s forthcoming \"return to the spotlight\".[89]  L\\'Oreal Paris named Lopez their new Global Ambassador and the face of their brands, including EverPure hair care, Preference hair color and Youth Code skin care. Her EverSleek hair care ads made their debut in early 2011, to coincide with the release of Love? and her debut as a judge on American Idol.[90] To further promote her comeback, in February, Venus chose Lopez as their new Global Ambassador.[91] Lopez\\'s comeback single \"On the Floor\" was released later that same month. The song topped the charts across the globe, becoming one of the most successful singles of the year.[92] The song also became her highest charting single commercially as a lead artist, as well as her most successful airplay hit on contemporary hit radio, since \"Jenny from the Block\".[93] Love?, which was released in May, was a moderate commercial success, and was viewed as a humble comeback from Lopez, as many had considered her recording career over.[78] Lopez launched her next fragrance Love and Light in July, exclusively on HSN. 51,000 bottles of the fragrance were sold at its premiere, becoming Lopez\\'s most successful fragrance launch to date, making over $2.9 million.[94] In September, Lopez launched the Jennifer Lopez Collection, a clothing and accessories line for Kohl\\'s with Tommy Hilfiger.[95] In addition to the clothing line, she also launched the Jennifer Lopez Home Collection, featuring bedding, towels and luggage.[96] Later that same month Fiat, an Italian automobile manufacturer, enlisted Lopez to promote their products, including the 2012 Fiat 500 Cabrio. Olivier Francois, the Chrysler chief marketing officer, stated that she \"fits perfectly with the brand\".[97]  In January 2012, Lopez returned as a judge on the eleventh season of American Idol, earning a reported $20 million.[98] Later that same month, a new talent show, ¡Q\\'Viva! The Chosen, created by Simon Fuller premiered on Univision and was a hit for the channel.[99][100] It followed Lopez, Anthony and director-choeographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent for a Las Vegas show. On May 18, Lopez returned to the big screen starring alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison and Dennis Quaid in the film What to Expect When You\\'re Expecting, which is based on the novel of the same name.[101] In late May, Lopez released her fragrance Glowing by JLo, which she described as an \"evolution\" of Glow by JLo.[102]  Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, on June 14.[103] It was a lucrative, grossing over $1 million per show.[104] On July 12, she launched Teeology, a luxury T-shirt e-commerce.[105] Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, Ice Age: Continental Drift, the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise.[106] The film became her highest opening weekend figure.[107]  Lopez\\'s first greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, was released on July 24, 2012 in the United States.[108] It was released by Epic Records, as Lopez owed them one final album to end her contract, despite previously announcing that she had fulfilled her contract with the label.[109] Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Anthony and the \"breakup of a family\", felt as if the album\\'s sole single, \"Dance Again\", had come to her at the \"perfect moment\".[110][111] \"Dance Again\" and \"Goin\\' In\", a single from the soundtrack of the dance film Step Up Revolution, both reached the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs, giving Lopez her twelfth and thirteenth number one on that chart, respectively.[112] nuvoTV announced in September its premier partnership with Lopez, that will see her work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing in network programming.[113][114]  2013–2015: Television ventures and A.K.A.  In January 2013, Lopez starred alongside Jason Statham in the crime thriller Parker, in which she played Leslie.

The audience stays with her all the way\".[115] The following month, she gained widespread notoriety for wearing a daring black dress at the Grammy Awards, which revealed her entire right leg; despite a conservative dress code which had been issued to celebrities in attendance.[116] In May, Lopez was announced as the chief creative officer of nuvoTV. In addition, she founded the mobile phone retail brand Viva Móvil, which is catered specifically for Latinos.[117] She lobbied for more Hispanic diversity on television,[118] hoping to empower the Latin community in these media ventures, stating: \"There\\'s a big revolution going on, it\\'s like a media and cultural revolution of Latinos here in the United States. We\\'re realizing our power.

In April 2006, she sued to prevent him from publishing a book about their marriage, contending that it violated their confidentiality agreement.[174] The following year, a court-appointed arbitrator issued a permanent injunction forbidding Noa from \"criticizing, denigrating, casting in a negative light or otherwise disparaging\" Lopez. She was awarded $545,000 in compensatory damages and Noa was ordered to hand over all copies of materials related to the book to Lopez or her attorney.[175] A lawsuit regarding a compromising private honeymoon video in Noa\\'s possession is presently running.[176]  While working on her first album, On the 6, Lopez began dating record producer and rapper Sean Combs. On December 27, 1999, the couple was arrested along with two others in connection with a shooting outside the Times Square Club in New York.

Lopez was soon exonerated, having had nothing to do with the crime.[177] However, Combs was charged and indicted by a Manhattan grand jury.[178] After leaving Combs, Lopez developed a relationship with former back-up dancer Cris Judd, to whom she was married from September 29, 2001, to June 2002.[179] Following her second divorce due to irreconcilable differences, she commenced a high-profile relationship with actor and director Ben Affleck, to whom she became engaged in November 2002.[180][181] The media began to refer to them as \"Bennifer\", and they became a prominent supercouple in the media and popular culture. Bennifer became a popular term, which was eventually entered into urban dictionaries and neologism dictionaries as notable,[182] as the name blend started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of their first names.[183] The couple postponed their nuptials indefinitely a day prior to the planned ceremony in September 2003, citing the media\\'s interference with the event as the reason.[184]  Anthony and Lopez, 2006  Following her break-up with Affleck in January 2004, Lopez began dating her longtime friend, Marc Anthony (real name: Marco Antonio Muñiz). The couple wed that June,[185][186] and lived in Brookville, New York.[187] Two men attempted to ransom a private wedding video that was stolen from the couple for one million dollars; however, they were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of conspiracy, attempted grand larceny and possession of stolen property.[188] On November 7, 2007, during the final night of their co-headlining tour, Lopez and Anthony officially confirmed that they were expecting their first child.[189] The announcement ended months of speculation over the pregnancy.[190] Her father confirmed that the couple were expecting twins, revealing that it runs in the family: \"My sister also had twins, so it\\'s a hereditary thing.\"[191] Lopez, who is a Roman Catholic, has stated that her faith discouraged her from pursuing in vitro fertilization treatment while trying to get pregnant.[192]  Lopez gave birth to a son, Maximilian David, and a daughter, Emme Maribel, in Long Island, New York, on February 22, 2008.[193][194] The twins were introduced in the March 11, 2008, issue of People, for which the magazine paid a reported $6 million; the photographs of the twins became the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken at the time.[195] Three years later in July 2011, the couple announced their split, with Anthony filing for divorce in April 2012.[196] Their divorce was finalized on June 16, 2014, with Lopez retaining primary physical custody of the two children.[197] On December 31, 2014, she legally changed her name back to Jennifer Lopez, dropping Anthony\\'s last name (Muñiz).[198][199]  Lopez had an on-off relationship with her former backup dancer Casper Smart from October 2011 to August 2016.[200][201] In February 2017, she began dating former New York Yankees baseball player Alex Rodriguez.[202][203]  In March 2018, Lopez opened up about her own Me Too movement story of being sexually harassed by a director early on in her career, when she was asked to take her top off during one of her first films.[204][205] Lopez has also been an active advocate for the Time\\'s Up movement.[206]  Philanthropy and political activism  Following the September 11 attacks, Lopez was heavily involved in charitable activities. Joining various other artists, she was featured on charitable singles such as \"What\\'s Going On\" and \"El Ultimo Adios (The Last Goodbye)\", which benefited people affected by the tragedy.[207][208] One dollar from each ticket sold at Lopez and Anthony\\'s co-headlining North American concert tour, which grossed an estimated $10 million, was donated to Run for Something Better—a charitable organization supporting physical fitness programs for children.[77][209] In February 2007, Lopez was honored with the Artists for Amnesty prize by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, for her work in the film Bordertown, which shed light on the hundreds of female homicides in Ciudad Juárez. Lopez described it as \"one of the world\\'s most shocking and disturbing, underreported crimes against humanity.\"[210][211]  In 2009, Lopez launched the Lopez Family Foundation (originally known as the Maribel Foundation) alongside her sister, Lynda. The nonprofit organization seeks to increase the availability of healthcare for underprivileged women and children, offering a telemedicine program supported by a partnership with the Children\\'s Hospital Los Angeles. The foundation has led to the expansion of medical facilities in Panama and Puerto Rico, and created the Center for a Healthy Childhood at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx.[212][213]  In December 2012, Lopez held a charity drive that would affect her three favorite charities: the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club, the Children\\'s Hospital of Los Angeles as well as the American Red Cross, mainly benefiting victims of Hurricane Sandy, which devastated parts of her home town, New York City.[214] In May 2015, she became the first national celebrity spokesperson for the Children\\'s Miracle Network Hospitals and the BC Children\\'s Hospital Foundation (BCCHF), appearing in a campaign entitled \"Put Your Money Where the Miracles Are\".[215] That September, Lopez was announced as the first Global Advocate for Girls and Women at the United Nations Foundation.[216] This role sees her mobilizing action to address challenges faced by girls and women around the world, including maternal health care programs, education and violence against women.[217] In September 2017, following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, Lopez announced that she would be donating $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas residency to humanitarian aid for Puerto Rico.[218][219] Along with ex-husband Marc Anthony, she launched a humanitarian relief campaign entitled Somos Una Voz (English: We Are One Voice), an effort supported by various celebrities to rush supplies to areas affected by Hurricane Maria.[220] Lopez and Anthony presented a subsequent concert and telethon for disaster relief, \"One Voice: Somos Live!\", which raised over $35 million.[221] She was also among various artists featured on Lin-Manuel Miranda\\'s charity single \"Almost Like Praying\" which benefits Puerto Rico.[222]  Lopez is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has raised millions of dollars for HIV/AIDS research.[223] In June 2013, amfAR presented Lopez with its humanitarian award for her philanthropic work.[223] That September, she was awarded the Ally for Equality award presented by the Human Rights Campaign, for her support of the LGBT community.[224] The following year, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award.[225] In July 2016, Lopez released a single entitled \"Love Make the World Go Round\", a collaboration with Lin-Manuel Miranda, which benefits victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[226] She was also featured on the song \"Hands\" along with numerous other artists, also benefiting those affected by the Orlando shooting.[227] Among numerous other artists, Lopez signed an open letter from Billboard magazine to the United States Congress in 2016, which demanded action on gun control.[228]  Lopez endorsed President Barack Obama in his 2012 presidential campaign, speaking in television advertisements and attending a fundraising event for Obama in Paris.[229][230] She endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, headlining a free concert in Florida in support of her that October.[230][231]  Artistry  Musical style  According to author Ed Morales in The Latin Beat: The Rhythms And Roots Of Latin Music From Bossa Nova To Salsa And Beyond (2003), Lopez\\'s music explores the \"romantic innocence\" of Latin music, while strongly identifying with hip hop.[234] Growing up, she was influenced by Latin styles ranging from salsa to bachata, but it was the 1979 hip hop song \"Rapper\\'s Delight\" by The Sugarhill Gang that she said changed her life.[235] Her debut album On the 6 fuses the influence of Latin music with R&B and hip hop, which Lopez described as Latin soul. To the contrary, Morales described it as \"state-of-the-art dance pop\".[236] Dee Lockett, writing for the Chicago Tribune, stated that songs such as \"Waiting for Tonight\" made Lopez \"arguably the leading artist in the dance-pop movement at the time\".[237] While primarily sung in English, she speaks in Spanish and asserts her Latin heritage throughout the album, which is apparent in the song \"Let\\'s Get Loud\".[238][239][240] She has also recorded bilingual songs, including the Latin pop song \"Cariño\", for her second album J.Lo.[241] A departure from her previous albums, This Is Me... Then blends 1970s soul with \"streetwise\" hip hop.[242] \"Get Right\", from Rebirth, is built around a sample of \"Soul Power 74\" by Maceo and the Macks, and is characterized by a repetitive saxophone riff. The New York Times called it \"one of the year\\'s most unusual R&B songs\" which sounded \"like nothing else on the radio\".[243]  Described as autobiographical,[244] much of Lopez\\'s music has centered around the \"ups and downs\" of love.[245] The lyrical content of This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck, with the song \"Dear Ben\" being described as the album\\'s \"glowing centerpiece\".[246] Her first full length Spanish-language album, Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[247] When explaining her seventh studio album Love?, Lopez stated: \"There\\'s still so much to learn and that\\'s why the question mark.\"[245] Other recurrent themes in Lopez\\'s music have included her upbringing in the Bronx[236][248] and women\\'s empowerment.[249]  Lopez has been influenced by artists such as Tina Turner, James Brown, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Barbra Streisand.[250][251] She credited Rita Moreno\\'s performance in the 1961 musical film West Side Story as a major inspiration.[236] Critics have considered Lopez\\'s voice to be limited,[252][253] and obscured by the production of her music, while remaining \"radio-friendly\".[254] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone observed: \"Instead of strained vocal pyrotechnics, Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn\\'t need to belt because she knows you\\'re already paying attention [...] She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.\"[255] Meanwhile, AllMusic\\'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called her voice \"slight\" and wrote: \"Lopez was never, ever about singing; she was about style\".[256] Entertainment Weekly criticized her vocal performance for lacking the trademark \"husky-voiced voluptuousness\" she has in her films.[257] J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun regards Lopez as having a \"breathy\" stylistic range, but lacking personality.[258]  Dance and stage  Considered one of dance\\'s \"greatest success stories\",[155] Lopez felt an emotional connection to dance since her youth, when she specialized in ballet, jazz and flamenco.[259][260] Her career commenced on the variety television sketch comedy series In Living Color, where she was a part of an ethnically diverse dance group known as the Fly Girls.[261] Janet Jackson, whom she briefly served as a backup dancer for, has been credited by Lopez as an inspiration for her own dance and videos.[262] In 2015, Refinery29 ranked Lopez at number two on \"11 Of Pop\\'s Most Iconic Dancers\", behind Jackson.[263] Since beginning her own recording career, Lopez has become known for her body-emphasizing music videos, which often include dance routines.[264] Some of them have been the subject of controversy, including \"Jenny from the Block\", \"Dance Again\" and \"Booty\".[265][266] Her provocatively choreographed music video for \"If You Had My Love\" allowed Lopez to become a dominant figure on MTV networks worldwide.[267] Madeline Roth of MTV wrote: \"Her diverse videography encompasses some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century\",[268] with Rolling Stone writer Brittany Spanos observing that her \"dancing skills and ability to toy with her own celebrity have made her videos an important part of the new millennium’s pop canon.\"[269]  On stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship and sex appeal,[270] and often includes costumes such as bodysuits as part of her performance.[271][272][273] Author Priscilla Peña Ovalle stated in Dance and the Hollywood Latina: Race, Sex and Stardom (2011) that Lopez was one of the Latin stars who \"used dance to gain agency as working performers with mainstream careers, yet many of their roles paradoxically racialized and sexualized their bodies\".[274] Troy Patterson of Entertainment Weekly also observed that she used her body for emphasis on stage, \"She turned herself out as the fly girl hyperversion of postfeminist power, flaunting her control by toying with the threat of excess. In consequence, her star went supernova.\"[275] Her signature movements include \"clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations\".[276] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career, Lopez\\'s Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[277][278][279] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is \"undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show\".[270]  Lopez\\'s provocative stage performances have also drawn scrutiny at times. In May 2013, her performance on the finale of the television series Britain\\'s Got Talent was deemed inappropriate for family-friendly television, and drew viewer complaints to Ofcom.[280][281] Following her controversial performance at the musical festival Mawazine in 2015, Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it \"indecent\" and \"disgraceful\", while an education group claimed that she \"disturbed public order and tarnished women\\'s honor and respect\".[282]  Public image  Lopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour, December 2012.  Speaking of Lopez\\'s image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: \"Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles \"I\\'m Real\" and \"Jenny From the Block\". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick either as a primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she\\'s not asking you to come hither.\"[233] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: \"Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere.\" Holloway noted her image to be \"a dash of ghetto fabulousness\" and \"middle-class respectability\" for mass appeal.[283] Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: \"Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.\"[284] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture.[285] Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a \"showbiz phenomenon\".[286]  Lopez is widely celebrated for her callipygian figure,[287] which was the inspiration for Sir Mix-a-Lot\\'s 1992 hit \"Baby Got Back\".[288] She has been credited with influencing a change in mainstream female body image.[289] In Latin Sensations (2001), Herón Marquez wrote: \"Because she wasn\\'t rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold and allowed millions of women to feel good about their bodies. Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.\"[36] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as \"in and of themselves, a cultural icon\".[290] Details magazine named Lopez the \"Sexiest Woman of the Year\" in 1998,[291] and she led FHM\\'s \"100 Sexiest Women\" list twice.[292] In 2011, she was named \"The Most Beautiful Woman\" by People.[293] The following year, VH1 ranked her the fourth on their list of \"100 Sexiest Artists\",[294] while Vibe magazine named her the most \"lustable\" celebrity of the past twenty years.[295] In 2014, Lopez stated, \"There\\'s this funny notion in America that you can\\'t be a mom and be sexy (...) It\\'s the craziest thing I\\'ve ever heard... The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.\"[131]  Lopez is a tabloid fixture[296][297] and has admitted to having a \"less-than-perfect\" public image.[298] The media often draw comparisons between Lopez and actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships.[299][300] In fact, Lopez has been dubbed a \"modern-day Liz Taylor\" by the media.[301] Lynn Hirschberg of W compared her glamorous public persona to that of Taylor.[302] Her style is described by Billboard\\'s Lauren Savage as scantily clad.[303] Lopez has been criticized by the animal rights organization PETA for inclusion of fur in her fashion lines and outfits.[304] She has received a bad reputation as being a demanding \"diva\",[305] but she constantly refutes this.[306] In 2003, The Observer remarked that Lopez was \"the woman immortalised in a million headlines as \\'Hollywood\\'s most demanding diva\\' ... Lopez must wonder what heinous crime she has committed to become the most vilified woman in modern popular culture.\"[307]  Legacy and cultural impact  Lopez is regarded as the most influential Hispanic performer in the United States, credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[11][308] In 1999, The Record newspaper observed that she was responsible for the introduction of a Latina presence in the film industry, which was a \"whites-only preserve\" for much of its history.[309] Described as a \"multidimensional artist who had turned into a financial powerhouse\",[310] Lopez became the highest-paid actress of Hispanic descent in history.[311] Miriam Jiménez Román stated in The Afro-Latin Reader: History and Culture in the United States (2009) that \"[she] was able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries\".[312] In 2012, business magazine Forbes suggested that Lopez \"may be the most powerful entertainer on the planet\",[313] and named her \"the world\\'s most powerful Latino celebrity\".[314]  Upon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Lopez contributed to the \"Latin explosion\" occurring in entertainment at the time.[315] Writing for The Recording Academy, Brian Haack described her as the \"breakout female star\" of the Latin pop movement in American music.[316] She was featured on the cover of the first issue of Latina magazine in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza stating that there is \"no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer\".[317] Around the time her career began to burgeon, the emphasis on Lopez\\'s curvaceous figure grew; scholar Sean Redmond wrote that this was a sign of her role and social power in the cultural changes occurring in the United States.[318] In August 2005, Time listed Lopez as one of the most influential Hispanics in America, remarking: \"Why? Because over a decade ago, she was an anonymous background dancer on the second-rated sketch-comedy show. Today she\\'s known by two syllables.\"[45] In February 2007, People en Español named her the most influential Hispanic entertainer.[308] In 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[319][320]  Lopez is considered a global icon, and is often described as a triple threat performer.[321][322][323] VH1 ranked her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons,[324] number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music,[325] and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.[326] Lopez has been cited as an influence or inspiration by a range of entertainers, including Jessica Alba,[327] Adrienne Bailon,[328] Kat DeLuna,[329] Mike Doughty,[330] Fifth Harmony,[331] Becky G,[332] Selena Gomez,[333] Ryan Guzman,[334] Kelly Key,[335] Q\\'orianka Kilcher,[336] Demi Lovato,[337] Normani,[338] Pitbull,[339] Francia Raisa,[328] Naya Rivera,[340] Bebe Rexha,[341] Gwen Stefani,[342] Stooshe,[343] and Kerry Washington.[344]  Famed for her distinct style and fashion sense, Us Weekly named Lopez \"Style Icon\" of the 2000s decade.[345] The Green Versace \"Jungle Dress\" that she wore at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2000 was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[346] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google\\'s image search.[347][348] Her style has influenced a range of celebrities, including Kelly Rowland, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Love Hewitt.[349][350][351] Her record-breaking fragrance line has become the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion as of 2012.[352] Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, has been credited with influencing the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s,[353] with perfume critic Chandler Burr stating: \"Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first [to have her own scent], but Glow kicked the whole thing into overdrive.\"[354] Following the success of Lopez\\'s appointment as a judge on American Idol in 2010, a trend of networks hiring \"big names\" for judging panels on reality shows ensued. The Hollywood Reporter branded this \"The J.Lo Effect\".[355]  Achievements  As of 2018, Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, including 40 million albums,[356] and her films have grossed a cumulative total of US$2.9 billion.[357] She remains the only female entertainer to have a number one album and film simultaneously in the United States.[358][359] With her second studio album J.Lo (2001), Lopez became the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to achieve a number one album in the United States since its inception in 1953.[360] Her album J to tha L-O! The Remixes was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records as the first number one remix album in the United States.[361] In 2010, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award for her contribution to the arts.[362] Lopez\\'s return to prominence the following year with her single \"On the Floor\"—among the best-selling singles of all time, and its music video recognized as the \"Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time\" by Guinness World Records in 2012—is regarded as one of the greatest musical comebacks in history.[363][364] In 2013, she was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her musical contributions,[365] and Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud.[366] In 2014, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award.[367] Billboard magazine ranked her as the ninth greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016.[368] In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award.[369] In 2018, Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to claim the prize since its introduction in 1984.[370]  Discography  Filmography  Tours and concerts  Tours  Residency concerts  See also  References  Further reading  Gallick, Sarah (2003).

       " 'The Material Girl, who has drawn the ire of the Vatican over the years, is eyeing luxury properties in two of the city\\'s neighborhoods, according to reports.  ROME – Reportedly tiring of life in London and New York, the Material Girl is said it be mulling a move to the Eternal City.  The Italian media reported Wednesday that Madonna may be looking to acquire a luxury property in Rome.  The most likely candidates: a luxury villa on the Aventine Hill, or a penthouse apartment in the iconoclastic neighborhood designed by early 20th century architect Gino Coppede. There is no official word from the camp of the singer born as Madonna Louise Ciccone about a possible move, though the 54-year-old pop icon has always maintained close ties with Italy, the home of her ancestors.  Madonna’s personal donation of $500,000 to help the victims of the devastating 2009 earthquake in Abruzzo was at first larger than the aid from the U.S. government. She has also opined periodically on Italian affairs, and has been a vocal critic of media tycoon and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  VIDEO: Madonna Turns 54: Her Top 5 Hits  Madonna’s directorial effort, W.E., which told the story of the love story between British King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year.  But she has also been attacked repeatedly by the Vatican, which called the video for her 1989 hit \"Like a Prayer\" \"blasphemous\" for its visions of burning crosses, statues that cried blood and a scene where Madonna herself seduced a black actor playing Jesus Christ. In 2004, she was also criticized for promoting the Kabbalah religious belief, which the Vatican considers to be a threat to Roman Catholicism.  Most recently, church officials blasted her for the decision to sing while hanging from a crucifix during a 2006 concert in Rome. After that show, Cardinal Ersilio Tonino, speaking for Pope Benedict XVI, said, \"This time the limits have really been pushed too far. She should be excommunicated.\"  She last attracted headlines in Italy in June, when during another concert in Rome, Madonna flashed her buttocks, revealing her black undergarments and fishnet stockings, to the delight of concertgoers.  Rome has been a popular destination for the entertainment world’s elite since the Dolce Vita days of the 1950s and 1960s. But in recent years, few top stars have gone as far as to move there.',\n",

Our hearts are broken, but we will never forget the nine months she graced this pained planet with her radiance. #giamarieforever,” she continued, sharing the sad news alongside a series of photos of her sphynx cat.  In another emotional post, Dunham, 32, went on to reveal that after coming home to find Gia “limp and wheezing,” the cat died in her arms while being rushed to the vet.  “Yesterday I was due at work at 8am. Showed up, watched rehearsal, drank my Starbucks, chill times. But at 8:15 I started to feel sick. Chills, sore throat, rapid descent. So I told Jenni I had to go home. Now. It just felt urgent. I walked in the door and found Gia limp and wheezing. She died in my arms at 9:15 as we rushed to the vet. She called me home. I’m so glad I listened,” she explained.  In a separate post, she simply wrote, “My tiny baby Gia, gone but never forgotten 💔.”  RELATED: Medical Challenges, Dog Drama and More: A Look Back at Lena Dunham’s Emotional Year  Just three days before her pet’s death, Dunham spoke warmly about her cat on social media.  “I have two cats but only one sleeps on my face and sits on my lap while I pee.

Earlier this year, the writer and actress also gave the cat a special “woman crush wednesday” shoutout, writing, “#WCW #2 is Gia Marie Carangi the cat in her new angora lewk (she cares not what you feel about her nude belly. Like mama like baby.)”  Last year, Dunham found herself embroiled in some doggy drama after sharing that she and then-boyfriend Jack Antonoff had decided to re-home their dog Lamby, following “four years of challenging behavior and aggression.”  The writer experienced a backlash on social media, some of which centered on her claim that her dog’s behavioral issues were caused by “terrible abuse” Lamby suffered in the past. Robert Vazquez, a spokesperson for the shelter that Dunham adopted Lamby from, went on to say that the dog “wasn’t crazy” when Dunham adopted him.  However, Dunham’s dog trainer Matt Beisner, came to her defense. “She was at her wit’s end,” he said.  Dunham still has three pets at home: a sphinx cat named Irma and poodles Karen and Susan.',\n",

       " 'Ellen DeGeneres has all the feels!  On Thursday\\'s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the daytime talk show host continues to celebrate her 60th birthday by having wife Portia de Rossi on the program.  Seated next to Ellen, the 45-year-old actress proceeds to bring her wife of nine years to tears upon presenting her with the \"best\" gift.  \"It\\'s your 60th birthday and this gift had to be really special and it had to represent who you are and what you really care about,\" Portia explains. \"Not just now, but what you\\'ve always cared about.

       " \"Netflix will premiere “13 Reasons Why” Season 2, the next chapter in its controversial hit teen-suicide drama, on May 18.  The streamer announced the premiere date on social media, with the caption, “The tapes were just the beginning.” That came after it teased the reveal in posts earlier Monday saying “The truth is developing” and a live-stream showing two Polaroid photos — leaving fans on tenterhooks for several hours.  Netflix announced the renewal of “13 Reasons” last May, after the freshman season debuted in March 2017 and quickly captured widespread buzz.  The first season of the series, based on Jay Asher’s young-adult book by the same name, centers around the death a high-school girl, Hannah, played by Katherine Langford, who has left behind a series of 13 cassette tapes for her friend and crush Clay (Dylan Minnette) explaining what led her to suicide. The show also stars Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Brian d’Arcy James, and Kate Walsh.  Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of Hannah’s death, as the other characters start their journeys toward healing and recovery. In the upcoming season, Hannah’s parents file a lawsuit against Liberty High School. But, according to Netflix, “A series of ominous Polaroids lead Clay and his classmates to uncover a sickening secret and a conspiracy to cover it up.”  “13 Reasons Why” season 2 is being produced for Netflix by Paramount Television. The show is also executive produced by Selena Gomez, along with Mandy Teefey, Kristel Laiblin, Joy Gorman Wettels, Michael Sugar and Steve Golin.  Related Top TV Salaries Revealed Why Sandra Bullock's Children Liked Her Better While She Was Shooting 'Bird Box'  The first season of the show stimulated discussions about teen suicide — and controversy. After its release Netflix added more viewer warnings to “13 Reasons Why,” which is rated TV-MA, and included links to suicide-prevention resources in the documentary the accompanies the series. It ranked as the fourth most-tweeted-about TV show of 2017 (after “Game of Thrones,” “Stranger Things” and “Big Brother”).  Netflix said season 2 of “13 Reasons Why” will carry a new warning video in front of each episode telling viewers about how to get help and pointing them to resources on the website 13reasonswhy.info. It also plans an after-show, “Beyond the Reasons,” with the show’s actors, experts, and educators breaking down the series.  The season 2 announcement trailer features Depeche Mode’s 1993 single “I Feel You”:\",\n",

It seems just like old times, only better.’  While Star notes that George Clooney’s rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer ‘wants to keep the reunion under the radar’, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.

       " '“Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is currently Broadway’s hottest ticket. One person who won’t be lucky enough to score a ticket? President Donald Trump.  “No,” Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, said when asked if Trump should see the show. “Anybody else, yes.”  Even though the play itself is not overtly political, Harry Potter fans have drawn comparisons between Trump and the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort, since the 2016 presidential election.  “I really do believe that’s why it’s resonating at the moment,” Dumezweni said on the red carpet at the Tony Awards. “We, all as human beings, are fighting to be connected. If you’re not seen and not heard, that’s where dangerous stuff happens. That’s where people under the radar do very cruel things.”  The two-part stage play, based on J.K.

       " 'SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of “American Horror Story,” titled “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” which aired on Sept. 12.  The premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult” found Ally (Sarah Paulson) to be, well, a mess after the election. As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.  But first, we pick up where we left off — with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally’s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally’s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, “I think there might be something wrong with me.” (But hey: Just because she’s paranoid, it doesn’t mean someone isn’t out to get her.)  Meanwhile, we see that Kai’s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him… while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it’s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council — a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang — he quotes Trump’s “rapists and criminals” line, yelling, “Look at my face, Michigan!”  Related ‘American Horror Story: Cult’ Cast: Who’s Returning, Who’s Not, and Who’s New 10 Best ‘American Horror Story’ Episodes  Speaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the “hive mind” theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.  And this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman’s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple — in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn’t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They’re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that’s just “the way of the world now.” Indeed, Harrison.  Ally — surprise! — is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang’s old house so soon after the murders. But she’ll soon learn that they’re the least of her worries. Something’s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she’s “got this.” One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant’s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.  Unsurprisingly, there’s an investigation, but there’s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by “AHS” newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that “he’s American.” Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally’s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has a troubling stockpile of them as he started to collect them, in a sense, when Barack Obama became president. Harrison goads on Ally’s fears, telling her, it’s “the only thing that will make you feel safe again.”  Ivy, concerned, invites Ally’s therapist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson) for a home call. Here, Ally tells him that she feels “vindicated” by her phobias and that they keep her safe, which… is one way to go. “The world is f—ed up,” she tells him. “The election made it worse.” She shows him her new gun, and while he’s worried, he’s unable to tell Ivy because of doctor-patient confidentiality, Ally notes.  Later, after Ally’s fortified her house, she gets an unwelcome visit from Kai, who she best knows currently as the man who dumped coffee all over her and Ivy in the last episode. He’s making a visit to campaign for office, and in a chilling scene, we see right rhetoric v. left rhetoric in full form. Ally, ironically from behind her newly installed bars, tells Kai that she’s interested in “building bridges, not walls.” Kai asks if he can get a drink of water, and Ally refuses to let him in and threatens to call the cops. Crazed, Kai yells, “It’s so easy until it’s you they’re coming for!”  This does not help Ally’s mental status. Later, as Ivy’s gone at the restaurant, Ally stares reluctantly at her pills. Winter picks up on this — she encourages Ally to have some wine and a bath to unwind, instead of taking her medication. Winter goes so far as to draw a bath for her, and when Ally’s relaxing, she reappears. While Ally is surprised at first, Winter starts to help wash her off. It’s clearly a seduction technique, and it’s kind of genius: she knows Ally’s stressed, and therefore relaxes her into seduction. But nothing ruins the mood like crazed clown murderers.  Suddenly, the power goes out, and with it, so does Winter, exclaiming that she has to go home to save her laptop. Harrison appears at her window to yell one of the best lines of the episode: “Lesbians! We’re under attack!” It’s interesting that he goes political, telling Ally that it could be Russians or “those crazy freaks in North Korea,” seemingly playing on her fears. Ally panics and calls Ivy, who’s dealing with the power outage at the restaurant too. When Ally’s phone dies, Ivy sends Pedro — the employee currently under investigation for murder — with some supplies for her.  Meanwhile, Ally’s lost it. She finds that someone’s cut the cords in her fusebox, and even sees a few of the masked murderers. When she runs upstairs to grab Oz, she has to throw one off of from the top of the stairs (and though it could mean nothing, it’s worth noting: there’s no thump to be heard when the assailant hits the ground). With her gun in hand, she rushes Oz to the door and instructs him to run to the neighbors’ house. When she opens the door, however, someone’s standing there, and in her panic, she shoots him. But lo and behold, it was Pedro there to help her — and now, he could very well be dead.  Now, not only has Ally committed a murder and lost another friend, but my guess is Kai will try to use this to his advantage. Maybe his fear-mongering is working — on Ally, at least.',\n",

       " 'Angelina Jolie wants to get “revenge” on Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, according to a completely wrong report. The story alleges Jolie is facing her “worst fear” now that Pitt and Aniston have supposedly reunited, and claims she’s striking back. But Gossip Cop can debunk the contentions.  According to Woman’s Day, Jolie has been a “constant fixture on the red carpet” recently and is “pulling out all the stops to look simply stunning at every occasion,” but her “flawless show-off is purely for Brad and Jennifer’s benefit.” The narrative suggests Jolie wants her estranged husband and his ex-wife to see how well she’s doing, even though she’s privately upset. “Ange is one green-eyed woman right now and can’t stand the thought of Brad spending time with Jen,” a so-called “source” is quoted as saying.  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  “She’s seething even thinking about it,” the tabloid’s supposed snitch continues, alleging Jolie was “always petrified” Aniston would “rear her head again.” In fact, the purported tipster claims Jolie would “squirm and spit venom” if she ever saw a “glimpse” of Aniston’s name during her marriage to Pitt. The gossip magazine even contends “Jennifer’s name was banned from the Jolie-Pitt household,” and asserts that with a “romantic reunion [in] the cards between Brad and Jennifer,” Jolie’s “biggest fears could be realized.”  The outlet’s aforementioned “source” alleges, “The very thought of Jen playing ‘stepmom’ to [her] kids… makes her toes curl. She says it’s her worst nightmare, which she can’t and won’t let happen.” And so the publication claims Jolie plans on getting her “revenge” by proving Pitt “got back with Jennifer before they had officially broken up in 2016.” Explains the questionable insider, “Ange is convinced that proving they were talking before the split and uncovering their romance will give her more ammunition” in her divorce battle with the actor.  “She hopes it will help her get full custody of the kids by exposing Brad’s ‘irresponsible’ behavior,” contends the “source,” prompting the tabloid to editorialize, “Sounds like the war is about to get even messier.” But while Jolie and Pitt do still need to work out their divorce settlement, there is no “war” involving Aniston. In fact, Pitt and Aniston haven’t even seen each other in ages.  The suggestion that they were carrying on an affair in 2016 behind Jolie’s back, while Aniston was committed to her own husband Justin Theroux, is out-and-out fiction. Indeed, this entire story relies on false premises. Pitt and Aniston were not secretly engaged in a “romance” during their respective marriages, and there’s no “romantic reunion” on the horizon now. Therefore, Jolie has no reason to get “revenge” on the pair or drag Aniston into her divorce proceedings.  Furthermore, the notion that Jolie is only attending red carpet events to get Pitt and Aniston’s attention is ridiculous and false. In most cases, she has been at awards shows, such as the BAFTAs earlier this month, because her film First They Killed My Father was nominated. Other times, Jolie’s received special honors, like at the recent American Society Of Cinematographers Awards, and in other instances, she’s been invited to participate as a presenter. This all has nothing to do with Pitt and Aniston.  Related slideshow: Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt having secret sleepovers and more tabloid tales debunked',\n",

       " 'The title of ABC’s upcoming “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff has finally been revealed. The series, which comes from showrunner Stacy McKee, will be called “Station 19.”  Series executive producer Paris Barclay announced the title on Twitter on Thursday, saying, “Welcome all of them to @STATION19 #greysanatomy spin-off.”  The spinoff is set at Seattle Fire Station 19 in Seattle, Wash., in the same universe as “Grey’s Anatomy” and will see Jason George’s Dr. Ben Warren giving up his life as a surgeon to become a firefighter. With his new firehouse home being just blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial, producers of the show have said there may be opportunity to see some characters crossover between the two series.  At the Alphabet’s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel in early January 2018, McKee said they were still considering a few options for the show’s title. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey noted that “coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do” and pointed out that the network executives at the time did not select a title for “Grey’s Anatomy” until right before that series debuted in 2005, either.  “We really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,” Dungey said.  “Station 19,” which falls under Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Miguel Sandoval.  Ortiz also announced the title on Twitter, with a little bonus video from the cast:  “Station 19” will premiere with a special two-hour event on ABC Mar. 22 before taking its usual “TGIT” time slot of 9 p.m. on Mar. 29.',\n",
       " 'On Thursday, it was announced that she had parted ways with Justin Theroux, after just two-and-a-half years of marriage.  And it has now been reported that Jennifer Aniston, 49, had stopped regularly spending time with the actor and writer several months before they made their shocking announcement.  According to TMZ, the former Friends star was last seen at her estranged husband\\'s apartment in New York City\\'s Greenwich Village in October, with sources telling the website that she\\'d stopped regular visits as far back as August.  Separated: Jennifer Aniston reportedly stopped regularly spending time with Justin Theroux several months ago, and was last photographed by TMZ at his New York City home in October  A further report from ETOnline suggests the couple split over a disagreement about where they should live.  Sources close to the pair have claimed that a difference of opinion on where to live was one of the main causes for the break up, with Jennifer preferring Los Angeles, while Justin opting for New York.  An insider explained to ETOnline: \\'He much prefers being [in New York] and that\\'s been a major issue for them for a long time.  \\'Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they\\'re not all \\'in the industry. He\\'s friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It\\'s an eclectic group and he doesn\\'t have that type of network in LA.  \\'Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighborhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her.  Separation: The estranged couple reportedly signed an \\'iron-clad\\' pre-nup before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly  \\'He really wanted her to be comfortable [in New York. He even negotiated with the paps to make a deal that they would only shoot her once per day and then leave her alone. He also agreed to move out of his apartment, which he loves.\\'  \\'She just never really could get settled in, she wasn\\'t happy [in New York. He was bicoastal, she was not.\\'  According to The Sun, the paparazzi is another reason for the split, after they took up residency in a park opposite their home, which infuriated the neighbours.  It\\'s said that because of this, said neighbours covered Justin\\'s beloved motorcycle with bits of Bologna sausage one day in an act of protest.  Split: A source told the website: \\'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense\\'  Justin apparently blamed Jennifer for this, as the paparazzi were pestering the couple more so for pictures of her, rather than him.  The source added that the pair fought to make their relationship work but were ultimately unsuccessful.  The insider explained: \\'They really were a great couple. And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.\\'  While the exes have yet to file for divorce, it has also been claimed they had taken a crucial step to protect their multi-million dollar fortunes, with an \\'iron-clad\\' pre-nup signed before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly.  A source told the publication: \\'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense. Jen’s assets and Friends fortune are protected.\\'  Acclaimed: Jennifer, 49, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200m (above with L-R co-stars Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox)  Jennifer, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200 million.  For the last two seasons of Friends, which ran between 1994 and 2004, Jennifer and her five co-stars were paid a record $1 million an episode.  She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses, Bruce Almighty, and He\\'s Just Not That Into You, amassed an impressive property portfolio and is the face of campaigns included SmartWater.  Justin, who has starred in TV shows The Leftovers, Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20 million.  Talented: She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses (above), Bruce Almighty, and He\\'s Just Not That Into You  MailOnline has contacted representatives for Jennifer and Justin for comment.  The decision to go their separate ways \\'was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year\\', according to a statement released on Thursday through Jennifer\\'s publicist.  The Along Came Polly star became engaged to the Leftovers actor in August 2012, and they married in a surprise ceremony at their LA home on August 5, 2015.  The couple\\'s statement says they would have handled their separation privately, but they wanted to counter tabloid speculation and \\'convey the truth directly.\\'  They say they intend to maintain love and respect for each other.  Jennifer and Justin were last pictured together during a New Year\\'s getaway trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  Multi-millions: Justin, 46, who has starred in TV shows including The Leftovers (above), Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20m.  The shock split will come as a surprise to many as Justin had previously described Jennifer as his \\'ally\\'.  He shared with United Airlines\\' Rhapsody magazine back in April 2017: \\'Marriage makes the small things much smaller and the big things small. You have an ally. It\\'s good to have someone have your back.\\'The couple tied the knot in August 2015 and it was made \\'so much more special\\' because they kept it secret.  Justin added: \\'It\\'s so much more special when it\\'s just your closest friends and family and it\\'s lovely. [Jennifer and I] wanted it to be a peaceful environment, you don\\'t want it to be hectic.\\'  Justin had admitted being married to Jennifer has had a calming effect on him.  He explained: \\'Obviously, I\\'m married. I think marriage taught me to settle a little bit. It does have a calming effect. I think it\\'s at what age you make that commitment. When you hear about people in the \\'50s getting married at 20, you\\'re like, What were they thinking?  Spark: The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012\\'s Wanderlust, five years after meeting on the set of Tropic Thunder  \\'My grandparents were together for over 50 years. My grandfather used to write one sentence every day in his journal: \"I love Anne more than ever today.\" I think that was his meditation - keeping him in his marriage, and also his appreciation for it. It was very touching.\\'  Jennifer and Justin met on set of Ben Stiller and Jack Black comedy Tropic Thunder in 2007.  The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012\\'s Wanderlust.  They got engaged on his 41st birthday while dining at Dan Barber restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village, New York City in August 2012.  Three years later Jennifer and Justin married in a top secret ceremony at their home in Los Angeles in August 2016.  Jennifer was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005.',\n",

       " \"Warning: This post contains spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War.  You expected superheroes to die in Avengers: Infinity War. You probably didn’t expect so many superheroes would perish by the end of the film.  The Russo brothers, who directed the film, let audiences know early on that no character was safe: fan favorite Loki is killed off in the first few minutes. Other characters met an ugly fate throughout the movie at the hands of Thanos and his minions, including Gamora (more on that later). But it wasn’t until the very end of the film that heroes began to disappear — literally.  Thanos fulfilled his plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and with the snap of his fingers, people began to disintegrate. But are they really gone? Probably not. Black Panther just broke every record at the box office, and Disney is eager to make a sequel. A second Spider-Man is already in the works. And Marvel has confirmed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will hit theaters in 2020.  How then will the remaining heroes bring all these characters back? Note that all the members of the original Avengers team — Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and (presumably) Hawkeye — survived Thanos’ attack. Presumably they will unite one last time in Avengers 4 next year to reverse the curse.  In the meantime, here is a full list of Avengers: Infinity War deaths and survivals.  Here’s who died in Avengers: Infinity War  Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in Marvel Studios' AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR Marvel Studios  Loki: Turns out Loki (Tom Hiddleston) wasn’t such a bad guy after all. In the opening scene of the movie, Loki hands over the Tesseract to Thanos (Josh Brolin) to save the life of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Loki offers fake fealty to Thanos and then immediately tries to assassinate the evil alien. Thanos doesn’t buy Loki’s trick and quickly murders him. Thanos quips, “No resurrections this time” after killing the trickster god, who has seemingly died twice before in the film series.  Heimdall: Thanos and his children murder Thor’s best friend Heimdall (Idris Elba) when they invade Thor’s ship. But before he dies, the Asgardian opens up a gateway to Earth so the Hulk can escape. Thor cries out when Heimdall perishes, and swears that Thanos will die for his actions. He does sort of avenge Heimdall later by stabbing Thanos, but unfortunately Thanos is already invincible at that point.  Gamora: Thanos travels to a planet with his adopted daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana). There, they encounter Red Skull, the baddie from Captain America: The First Avenger who has been cursed to guard the Soul Stone. Red Skull tells Thanos that he will have to sacrifice something he loves in order to get the Soul Stone. Despite taking a commanding lead in the World’s Worst Dad competition, Thanos apparently loves Gamora — just enough to throw her over a cliff. Gamora dies and Thanos walks away with another Infinity Stone.  Don’t mourn yet though: If the Avengers find a way to reverse all that Thanos has done, they may be able to bring Gamora back. And who better to finally kill the villain in the end?  Vision: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) destroys the Infinity Stone inside Vision’s (Paul Bettany) head to keep it from Thanos. But Thanos uses the Time Stone to turn back time and restore the stone and Vision. He then crushes Vision’s head in his hands and takes the Infinity Stone. Vision is left lifeless on the ground.  Here’s who disintegrated in Avengers: Infinity War  Marvel Studios  Black Panther/T’Challa: Okoye (Danai Gurira) cries out as her king disintegrates. Chadwick Boseman will likely be back, but in the meantime will someone else don the Black Panther suit? Here’s hoping Shuri or Okoye gets to try out his claws.  Spider-Man/Peter Parker: Poor Spider-Man (Tom Holland). He was just a kid. But don’t worry, Spider-Man is already set to appear in a Spider-Man: Homecoming sequel next year, Spider-Man: Far From Home. There is a small chance that Tom Holland’s Spidey really did die, and Miles Morales — another Spider-Man from the comic books whose existence Marvel teased in Homecoming — could take over for him.  Doctor Strange/Stephen Strange: Marvel has been cagey about confirming a Doctor Strange 2 and now we know why. Doctor Strange disintegrates in Infinity War. But he also is the only character who hints that he may be able to return. As he dies, he tells Iron Man that giving up the Time Stone to Thanos in exchange for Iron Man’s life was the “only way.”  Earlier in the movie, Doctor Strange looked into many possible futures and probably saw that the only way to ultimately defeat Thanos — and possibly bring everyone back —was to lose that particular battle.  Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes and Falcon/Sam Wilson: Many fans have speculated that either Bucky or Falcon will take over the Captain America mantle when Steve Rogers retires. But his time has not come yet: Cap survives but loses his two best friends.  Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff: This loss hurts: Scarlet Witch seems to be the only superhero with the ability to destroy an Infinity Stone. The Avengers will have to find a clever way to destroy the stones as they fight Thanos in the next movie without her.  The Guardians of the Galaxy: Most of the remaining Guardians — Star-Lord, Groot, Drax and Mantis — all perish in the culling. Only Rocket remains. Marvel recently confirmed that the planned Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 movie remains on hold following the dismissal of director James Gunn, so the fates of the Guardians remain up in the air.  Nick Fury and Maria Hill: The former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents disintegrate in New York in a post-credit scene from the film — but not before they call on Captain Marvel for help. (More on her later.)  Hope Pym, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne: Though Hope Pym (the Wasp) and her parents did not appear in Infinity War, they did star in Ant-Man and the Wasp. They all disintegrated in that film’s mid-credits scene.  Shuri: Black Panther’s sister Shuri tries to remove the Infinity Stone from Vision’s head, but is thrown from her lab by one of Thanos’ children before she can finish. We don’t see what happens to her when half the world’s population disappears, but in the trailer for the sequel, Avengers: Endgame, we find out that the Avengers count her among the disappeared.  Here’s who survived Avengers: Infinity War  Chuck Zlotnick—Marvel Studios  Captain America/Steve Rogers: Captain America actor Chris Evans has been suggesting for months that he would die in Infinity War. But when he faces down Thanos one-on-one, Thanos inexplicably decides to toss Cap aside instead of just killing him. Captain America survives.  Iron Man/Tony Stark: Despite being stabbed in the stomach, Iron Man survives. Doctor Strange trades the Time Stone to save Iron Man’s life.  Thor: With the help of his new battle axe, Thor is able to stab Thanos in the heart. Thor survives, but he doesn’t stop Thanos from destroying half the universe.  Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff: Black Widow takes out several of Thanos’ children in the battle in Wakanda and survives the fight.  Hulk/Bruce Banner: Bruce Banner also manages to live despite his inability to turn into the Hulk for most of the movie.  War Machine/James Rhodes: Rhodey lost the use of his legs at the end of Captain America: Civil War (though he can now walk with the aid of Stark technology). At least he made it through the end of Infinity War.  Rocket and Nebula: Of the original Guardians crew, only Rocket survives. Gamora’s sister Nebula also lives. Perhaps the two will reunite in the next film.  Okoye and M’Baku: Black Panther may be dead, but Wakanda lives on. Okoye and M’Baku survive. Likely, one of them — or perhaps Shuri — will have to lead the Wakandan army in any Avengers 4 battles,  Ant-Man/Scott Lang: Though he did not appear in Infinity War itself, a mid-credits scene in Ant-Man and the Wasp revealed that Ant-Man survived the culling. Unfortunately for him, he had entered the Subatomic Realm just before Thanos snapped his fingers. Ant-Man’s allies who were supposed to pull him out—Hope Pym, Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne—all disintegrated. But the Avengers: Endgame trailer revealed that he escaped.  Hawkeye/Clint Barton: The archer (Jeremy Renner) was conspicuously missing from Avengers: Infinity War. The stay-at-home dad apparently told the rest of the Avengers that fighting Thanos was too risky. But the Avengers: Endgame trailer revealed that Clint has survived and adopted a darker costume. Fans speculate that he’s taken on a darker identity from the comics too as he seeks to avenge his family: Ronin, a lonely hero.  Here’s who went M.I.A. in Avengers: Infinity War  Pepper Potts: The last we heard from Pepper, she was berating Tony for abandoning her to fight evil — again. We don’t know whether she survived the culling. But if she lived, she could fight in Avengers 4. Never forget: Pepper gained super powers in Iron Man 3. The Avengers: Endgame trailer shows Tony, floating through space, send a goodbye message to Pepper. If she is alive and receives it, she will likely try to save him.  Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers: If you stayed for the post-credit scene, you know that Nick Fury called Captain Marvel right before he disintegrated. The new, extremely powerful hero probably survived the culling and will likely swoop in to help save the day in Avengers: Endgame. Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) will also get her own solo film in March of 2019 before Endgame drops.  The Collector: We see the Collector (Benicio del Toro) alive and well in Thanos’ alternate reality, but then discover he’s not actually hanging out in his museum. Did Thanos kill him? Did he flee? Did he survive the culling? We don’t know.  Valkyrie: Where is Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson)? At the end of Thor: Ragnarok, Thor’s new ally Valkyrie boarded the ship bound for earth along with Thor, the Hulk, Loki, Heimdall and the rest of the Asgardians. But we don’t see her dead on the ground when Thanos takes over that same ship at the beginning of Infinity War. Thor makes no mention of her. Did she run out to get chips and guac on an escape pod and miss the whole fight?  Thompson jokingly tweeted in September that Valkyrie was alive “and thriving” after the apocalypse. Fans are hoping that the character will turn up to help Thor in the Infinity War sequel.  Wong and Ned: Wong (Benedict Wong) returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum to protect the building after Doctor Strange is taken captive by Thanos’ children. We never see whether he lives or dies. We also never find out whether Ned, who creates a distraction for his friend Peter Parker to escape a school field trip at the beginning of the movie, lives or dies.

And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...___TRUMP: Yeah, it\\'s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.(Crosstalk) AP: Really?TRUMP: Chancellor Merkel.TRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, \"Shake her hand, shake her hand,\" you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.AP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?TRUMP: No. Because, um, I\\'m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I\\'m at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...TRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen.___AP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?TRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it\\'s an artificial barrier. It\\'s not very meaningful. I think I\\'ve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I\\'m here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I\\'ve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they\\'ve never seen anything like what\\'s going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...TRUMP: I\\'ve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody\\'s written that. In fact, they said, \"Oh, well, he\\'s not treating them nicely,\" because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, \"Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.\" He\\'ll pay.AP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?TRUMP: He\\'s going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it\\'s a different kind of a presidency.AP: Do you feel like that\\'s one thing that you\\'ve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?TRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, \"I\\'m sorry, we\\'re going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,\" or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...TRUMP: I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It\\'s actually a little bit more than that, but it\\'s $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, \"I\\'ve never seen anything like this in my life.\" We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut — same planes, same everything — was because of me. I mean, because that\\'s what I do.TRUMP: Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, \"Could I thank you?\" I said, \"What?\" He said, \"You saved us $100 million.\" Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that\\'s a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of — it\\'s between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.AP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?TRUMP: More. I\\'m gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it\\'s great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?___AP: Do you feel like you\\'ve been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?TRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think we\\'re doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We\\'re going to be applying, I shouldn\\'t tell you this, but we\\'re going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it\\'s — we\\'ve worked on it long and hard. And you\\'ve got to understand, I\\'ve only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I\\'ve been here 92 days but I\\'ve only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so I\\'ve been working on health care for 60 days. ...You know, we\\'re very close. And it\\'s a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.AP: Is it this deal that\\'s between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you\\'re looking at?TRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They\\'re great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don\\'t seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don\\'t have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it\\'s fine. But you know there\\'s a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we\\'ll be in great shape on that. It\\'s going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.AP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week?TRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we\\'ve done a lot. You have a list of things. I don\\'t have to read it.___AP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?TRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I\\'m mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I\\'ll talk to you ...(Crosstalk.)TRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, \"By the way, I\\'d like you to solve the North Korean problem,\" doesn\\'t work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it\\'s a very exact thing. It\\'s not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?AP: I\\'m OK, thank you. No. ...TRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there\\'s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he\\'s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, \"By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you\\'re a currency manipulator.\" It doesn\\'t work that way.AP: Right.TRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don\\'t get it, in which case they\\'re very stupid people, or they just don\\'t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, \"He didn\\'t call them a currency manipulator.\" Well, for two reasons. Number One, he\\'s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it\\'s like generalities, it\\'s not. They have — they\\'ve actually — their currency\\'s gone up. So it\\'s a very, very specific formula. And I said, \"How badly have they been,\" ... they said, \"Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.\" That\\'s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that\\'ll work out or maybe it won\\'t. Can you imagine? ...AP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?TRUMP: No, because much of the foundation\\'s been laid. Things came up. I\\'ll give you an example. I didn\\'t put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.AP: I think it\\'s on there.TRUMP: I don\\'t know. ...AP: \"Begin the process of selecting.\" You actually exceeded on this one. This says, \"Begin the process of selecting a replacement.\"TRUMP: That\\'s the biggest thing I\\'ve done.AP: Do you consider that your biggest success?TRUMP: Well, I — first of all I think he\\'s a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don\\'t forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... He\\'s a young man. I\\'ve always heard that that\\'s the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I\\'ve always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I\\'ve done one in my first 70 days.TRUMP: Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ...TRUMP: I\\'m rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million — look at that, that\\'s a massive amount of money. And I\\'ll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes — Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary) said, \"I\\'ve never seen anything like this,\" because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible) ... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, \"I\\'ve never seen anything like this before, as long as I\\'ve been in the military.\" You know, that kind of cutting.AP: Right.TRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible) ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won\\'t happen.AP: Is that something you\\'re going to take on?TRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ...___AP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days — you\\'re not quite there yet — how do you feel like the office has changed you?TRUMP: Well the one thing I would say — and I say this to people — I never realized how big it was. Everything\\'s so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to —AP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean —TRUMP: Number One, there\\'s great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I\\'m saying to myself, \"You know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that\\'s involved,\" because people could have been killed. This is risk that\\'s involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area — you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away — and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you\\'d normally make. (unintelligible) ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So it\\'s far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest — you know, you go down the list.AP: Right.TRUMP. It\\'s massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that\\'s involved in some of the decisions.___AP: You\\'ve talked a little bit about the way that you\\'ve brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn\\'t translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?TRUMP: Well in business, you don\\'t necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you\\'re talking about health care — you have health care in business but you\\'re trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You\\'re providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don\\'t involve heart.AP: What\\'s that switch been like for you?TRUMP: In fact, in business you\\'re actually better off without it.AP: What\\'s making that switch been like for you?TRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we\\'re going to be doing major tax reform. Here\\'s part of your story, it\\'s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody\\'s saying, \"Oh, he\\'s delaying.\" I\\'m not delaying anything. I\\'ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That\\'s another thing that really has — I\\'ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, \"Well the one thing good is now I\\'ll get good press.\" And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.___AP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?TRUMP: Well I\\'m going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we\\'re putting out a massive tax reform — business and for people — we want to do both. We\\'ve been working on it (unintelligible). Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). ... We\\'re going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). ... And that\\'s a big story, because a lot of people think I\\'m going to put it out much later.AP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?TRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we\\'ve ever had. ...___AP: Obviously, that\\'s going to come in a week where you\\'re going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?TRUMP: I don\\'t know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it — you\\'ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it\\'s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I\\'ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college — but it\\'s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they\\'re 73 percent down. ... That\\'s a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it\\'s going lower. Now, people aren\\'t coming because they know they\\'re not going to get through, and there isn\\'t crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that\\'s stopped because they can\\'t get through.AP: It sounds like maybe you\\'re beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn\\'t have border funding in there, you would sign it.TRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I\\'m seeing. I\\'m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.AP: What do you think the estimate on it would be?TRUMP: Oh I\\'m seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I\\'ll do it for $10 billion or less. That\\'s not a lot of money relative to what we\\'re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in — and we\\'ll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall — they\\'re coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can\\'t do it because it\\'s a real wall. That\\'s a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We\\'re becoming a drug culture, there\\'s so much. And most of it\\'s coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.AP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn\\'t have —TRUMP: I don\\'t want to comment. I just don\\'t know yet. I mean, I have to see what\\'s going on. I really do. But the wall\\'s a very important thing to — not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn\\'t, I mean I\\'ll do things that aren\\'t necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.AP: If you don\\'t have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?TRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall\\'s getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it\\'s getting built. And it\\'s also getting built for much less money — I hope you get this — than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It\\'s not going to cost anywhere near that.AP: You think $10 billion or less.TRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it\\'s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And they\\'re using those numbers; they\\'re using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact it\\'s going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.___(Off-the-record discussion.)___TRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATO\\'s obsolete. But they didn\\'t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn\\'t in government. People don\\'t go around asking about NATO if I\\'m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO\\'s obsolete — not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO — NATO is obsolete, and I said, \"And the reason it\\'s obsolete is because of the fact they don\\'t focus on terrorism.\" You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.AP: What specifically has NATO changed?TRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) ... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete — I said two things — obsolete, and the country\\'s aren\\'t paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn\\'t believe. And then some expert on NATO said, \"You know, Trump is right.\" But I said it was obsolete because they weren\\'t focused on terror. ...It\\'s not fair that we\\'re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they\\'re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I\\'m very strong on it and I\\'m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.\"__AP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that?TRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.AP: Do you think it\\'s going to help Marine Le Pen?TRUMP: I think so.AP: Do you believe that she should be the president?TRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it\\'ll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what\\'s been going on in France.AP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to —.TRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. ...AP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...TRUMP: No, I am no different than — no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we\\'ve done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I\\'m not going to have it in this country. I\\'m not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it\\'s already largely, you know — we have tens — we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn\\'t be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It\\'s a big mistake.AP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are —TRUMP: I am not endorsing her and I didn\\'t mention her name.AP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.TRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.___AP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though — I mean, the markets go up and down.TRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I\\'ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, \"Only because of you am I making this massive investment.\" Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.___AP: What about NAFTA? What\\'s the plan on NAFTA?TRUMP: What would you like to know?AP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.TRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don\\'t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.AP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?TRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.AP: Termination is still on the table.TRUMP: Absolutely. If they don\\'t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.AP: What\\'s a timeline for that decision?TRUMP: It\\'s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it\\'s a six-month clause.___AP: If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?TRUMP: When Wikileaks came out ... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, \"Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.\" You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn\\'t have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren\\'t able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, \"Wow.\" It was just a figure of speech. I said, \"Well, look at this. It\\'s good reading.\"AP: But that didn\\'t mean that you supported what Assange is doing?TRUMP: No, I don\\'t support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn\\'t have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn\\'t even allow the FBI. How about this — they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won\\'t let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn\\'t (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.AP: CrowdStrike?TRUMP: That\\'s what I heard. I heard it\\'s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that\\'s what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn\\'t they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It\\'s incredible.AP: Can I just ask you, though — do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?TRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it\\'s OK with me. I didn\\'t know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it\\'s OK with me.___AP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign —TRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ...AP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.AP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?TRUMP: No, I don\\'t say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.AP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?TRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over.AP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal?TRUMP: I don\\'t talk to them about it.AP: You don\\'t talk to them about the Iran deal?TRUMP: I mention it, but it\\'s very personal when I talk to them, you know, it\\'s confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don\\'t say that they are different than my opinions, but I\\'d rather have you ask them that question.AP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?TRUMP: It\\'s possible that we won\\'t.___AP: Dreamers, you\\'ve talked about them, you\\'ve talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked —TRUMP: No, we aren\\'t looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers ... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he\\'s got some problems, it\\'s a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They\\'ve taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that\\'s what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.AP: And that\\'s going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?TRUMP: Yes. Yes. That\\'s our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being ... all over the country and nobody\\'s ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that\\'s probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. ...AP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don\\'t want to give them the wrong message with this.TRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I\\'ll give you that.

I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? ... That\\'s another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we\\'ve had in the Middle East with the ISIS (an abbreviation for the Islamic State group)? When (current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al) Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. ... We have had tremendous success, but we don\\'t talk about it. We don\\'t talk about it.AP: Do you mean you don\\'t talk about it personally because you don\\'t want to talk about it?TRUMP: I don\\'t talk about it. No. And the generals don\\'t talk about it.___AP: You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy?TRUMP: We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.AP: So you have decided on a plan?TRUMP: Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.AP: Right.TRUMP. Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.AP: Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people —TRUMP: Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.AP: Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?TRUMP: No, not much.AP: In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals —TRUMP: Well, they\\'ve also accepted my strategy.AP: Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?TRUMP: Not many.AP: So a small increase?TRUMP: It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. ... This is an important story. I\\'ve done a lot. I\\'ve done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I\\'m scheduled ... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...AP: What do you think it was about your chemistry?TRUMP: We had good chemistry. Now I don\\'t know that I think that\\'s going to produce results but you\\'ve got a good chance.AP: Uh-huh.TRUMP: Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They\\'re coming into China and they\\'re being turned away. That\\'s never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they\\'ve never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There\\'s a great foundation that\\'s built. Great foundation. And I think it\\'s going to produce tremendous results for our country.___AP: One more 100 days question.TRUMP: That\\'s fine.AP: ... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?TRUMP: Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn\\'t been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.AP: Do you mean your White House team when you say that?TRUMP: Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince (Priebus) has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It\\'s just the registration, there\\'s nothing you can do. So you\\'re losing the two biggest states, that\\'s where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it\\'s very, very hard. Look at Obama\\'s number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were ... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.AP: Right.TRUMP: So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions ... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn\\'t 270, it was 306. So there\\'s anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it\\'s not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here\\'s a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.AP: Three Democratic votes, but yeah.TRUMP: Three Democratic votes. OK. He\\'s an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all ... nothing. He\\'s like a ...AP: Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this —TRUMP: Yeah, I do.AP: Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.TRUMP: I think (I) can to an extent. But there\\'s a, there\\'s a basic hard-line core that you can\\'t break though, OK, that you can\\'t break through. There\\'s a hard-line group you can\\'t break through, you can\\'t. It\\'s sad. You can\\'t. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings (of Maryland). I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.AP: He disputed that slightly.TRUMP: That\\'s what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?AP: Yeah.TRUMP: There\\'s six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?AP: He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then —TRUMP: Well he said, you\\'ll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I\\'ll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It\\'s incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it\\'s like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.___AP: And that\\'s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it\\'s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people —TRUMP: No I have, it\\'s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it\\'s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.AP: I remember, right.TRUMP: It had 9.2 million people. It\\'s the highest they\\'ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS \"Face the Nation\" host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It\\'s the highest for \"Face the Nation\" or as I call it, \"Deface the Nation.\" It\\'s the highest for \"Deface the Nation\" since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It\\'s a tremendous advantage.I have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that\\'s what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you\\'re fake, but — but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It\\'s not that Fox treats me well, it\\'s that Fox is the most accurate.AP: Do you believe that? That Fox —TRUMP: I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it\\'s a terrorism ... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, \"He called it a terrorist attack.\" They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I\\'m 10-0 for that. I\\'ve called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I\\'m ... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I\\'m here and they\\'re not.___AP: Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there\\'s such real-time reaction with everything you say?TRUMP: Yeah.AP: Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?TRUMP: The one thing —AP: That you have to do —TRUMP: OK. The one thing I\\'ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don\\'t watch CNN anymore.AP: You just said you did.TRUMP: No. No, I, if I\\'m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)?AP: You just said —TRUMP: Where? Where?AP: Two minutes ago.TRUMP: No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what\\'d I say, I stopped watching them. But I don\\'t watch CNN anymore. I don\\'t watch MSNBC. I don\\'t watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what\\'s going on.AP: Right.TRUMP: In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch (MSNBC\\'s) \"Morning Joe.\" I don\\'t watch \"Morning Joe.\" I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it\\'s about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it\\'s such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I\\'ve developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don\\'t watch things that are unpleasant. I just don\\'t watch them.AP: And do you feel like that\\'s, that\\'s because of the office that you now occupy —TRUMP: No.AP: That you\\'ve made that change?TRUMP: I don\\'t know why it is, but I\\'ve developed that ability, and it\\'s happened over the last, over the last year.AP: That\\'s interesting.TRUMP: And I don\\'t watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don\\'t watch them anymore. A lot of people don\\'t watch them anymore, they\\'re now in third place. But I\\'ve created something where people are watching ... but I don\\'t watch CNN anymore. I don\\'t watch MSNBC anymore. I don\\'t watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I\\'d watch.AP: Sure.TRUMP: I just don\\'t. And that\\'s taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that\\'s a great, it\\'s a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you\\'re, you don\\'t watch this total negativity. I never thought I\\'d be able to do that and for me, it\\'s so easy to do now. Just don\\'t watch.AP: That\\'s interesting.TRUMP: Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m here. I don\\'t know.',\n",

       " 'Macaulay Culkin: ‘Satanic’ Hollywood Execs Ritually Murder Child Actors  Hollywood executives are “blood-thirsty Satanists” who “ritually abuse children in the industry”, according to Macaulay Culkin, who claims he only got out alive because he was a “smart, suspicious kid” and he “got too famous to be killed like some of the other kids”.  “You learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes”, Macaulay Culkin said, explaining that “the worst of them wear shoes made out of the skin of children that they ritually murdered.”  Speaking on radio in Paris, France, Culkin said “Have you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very unusual, distinctive look. I learned at a very young age to identify it.”  The news was picked up by French media, with mainstream French newspapers reporting on the explosive interview. However, within an hour of publication all reports had been removed from the internet.  French newspaper Les Echos’ headline translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin speaks about Hollywood ritual child abuse live on radio”. Les Echos have not responded to questions regarding why they deleted the article within an hour of publication, and if they were pressured to do so.  Les Echo’s report translated into English: “Macaulay Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as ‘skin trophies’.”  Skin Trophies  During the interview, Culkin claimed that children in the entertainment industry “learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,” explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear “skin trophies”. Explaining that he was 11 the first time he saw human leather, Culkin said he was “filming Home Alone 2 in New York” when he was “ushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive suit type, you know what I mean?”  “He tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of Coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I had it all. He said I had to get rid of my parents. I was like ‘Dude, I’m 11!’ and he said ‘You’re a man now’.”  Culkin, who has been living in Paris, France since 2003, then explained that the man “began to make his intentions clear”. “He started breathing real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.  He licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I think I managed to say ‘thank you’ and started thinking about how I could get immediately out of there.  Then he reached into his case and took out a crack pipe. He put it in his lap, took out this huge lighter, and continued to gaze at me with this overpowering sexual desire.”  “I was just staring at him. I think I said something like ‘Dude, I’m 11’ again.  I remember he said to me: ‘It’s a celebration, little man. To celebrate your upcoming success. Your many successes. Come. Sit back down’.  He was tapping the pipe on his crotch, smiling this total creepazoid smile. I ran out of the room, but I ran straight into this other guy who was outside the room and he grabbed me by the arm and threw me back inside.”  “He lit the pipe and blew the smoke in my face. He told me to look at his shoes. He said they were made from the skin of children he and his friends had murdered. He said leather made from human skin is the finest leather known to man.”  Death of a child star  Macaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about the provenance of the skin used to make his shoes.  “He asked me if I knew Heather O’Rourke. Yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching Poltergeist. I remembered her in Happy Days. She was so cute. I vomited all over his shoes.”  Heather O’Rourke was an American child actress, discovered by director Steven Spielberg when she was visiting MGM’s studios and later cast as Carol Anne Freeling in the horror film Poltergeist. She had the movie’s most recognizable line: “They’re here!”.  After years in the Hollywood system, Heather O’Rourke died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 12. The official cause of death was listed as “heart attack and septic shock” caused by a “misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis” in 1988, though many people were left wondering if there was more to the tragic story.  “Let’s just say I went off the rails after my experiences filming Home Alone 2. I’m 37 now and I’m still processing everything. The things I have seen…” Culkin said, before trailing off and abruptly changing the topic.  Culkin’s legacy  There are a fair few things Macaulay Culkin is remembered for.  People like to talk about his years of reported heroin addiction, which snowballed into rumors that he spent an obscene amount of money on drugs. Others chat about his friendship with pop star Michael Jackson, as well as him fronting a pizza-themed comedy rock band.  But Culkin no longer has the rail thin, sickly appearance of a junkie. Carrying some weight around the midriff, Culkin is looking happier now, and is filming the lead role for friend Seth Green’s vehicle Changeland.  Speaking about the future, Culkin said “I’ve come out the other side. I’m alive. That is more than can be said for many. I’m not finished yet. Hollywood is going to burn in my lifetime. You watch.”  yogaesoteric  February 25, 2018',\n",

During a lengthy interview with Marc Maron for the comedian’s WTF podcast, the Stranger Things star opened up about dealing with anxiety, self-hatred, mania, fear and sobriety — and revealed he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 after being committed to an asylum.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Harbour, 43, said his mental health was actually tied to his early preoccupation with spirituality.  “Here’s the interesting thing, which I’ve actually never truly spoken about publicly,” he said. “I actually was in this Catholicism thing … and I was sober for like a year and a half, I was 25, and I actually did have a manic episode and I was diagnosed as bipolar.”  “I really had like, a bit of a break where I thought I was in connection to some sort of God that I wasn’t really in connection to,” he continued. “It was like I had all the answers suddenly.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  David Harbour Robby Klein/Getty  Asked if he was on drugs at the time, Harbour said no.  “The interesting thing about it was that I realized I don’t really need them,” he said. “That I have a capacity to see ‘the elves’ in the corners of the room if I really allow myself to go there. So I actually was, by my parents, taken into a mental asylum.”  “I have one thing to say about the mental asylum,” he continued. “I’ve romanticized two things in my life and both have fallen short. One is being in a mental asylum. Really, really not as fun as you think it is. You do have a romantic idea of it … and it just ends up being sad and smells like s—. And the other thing was boating. I recently went out on a ship in open water, and I’d read Moby Dick a million times, and it really is not sexy. It’s very similar to the mental asylum experience.”  “Have you ever been to a mental asylum?” he added. “The only thing that defines a ‘crazy’ person and a ‘normal’ person — because you can seem very normal as a crazy person — is they’re convinced they’re sane. Crazy people are convinced they’re sane. It’s incredible.”  RELATED: David Harbour Addresses ‘Drama’ Among Stranger Things Cast: We’re a ‘Dysfunctional Family!’  After being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Harbour said he began taking medication.  “That’s actually when the drugs came in,” he said. “I’ve been medicated bipolar for a long time. And I’ve had problems going on and off. I’ve had a struggle, going on and off the medications.”  Now, Harbour said he’s found what works for him.  “The funny thing about my particular brain or mental illness is every time that I’ve had an episode like that, it’s always coupled with spirituality,” he said. “Generally, people are like, ‘I need to meditate more’ or ‘I need to get into yoga.’ And I need to like, eat a cheeseburger and just like, smoke cigarettes and hang out.”  “Because like the minute I get close to that — what I consider a flame — of like ‘the answers’ and the mysticism … it’s like I’m out of my mind,” he said. “So if I write the self-help book it’s going to be like, ‘Sit on the couch and play some video games.’ ”  With a lot of laughter and acknowledgment of how pedestrian it is to be a part of the tribe nowadays.

According to TMZ, the L.A. District attorney wasn\\'t convinced about the validity of the case, leading to the felony charges being dropped against the singer.  Songz\\'s lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, as well as other info damaging to Buera\\'s credibility.  The assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was \"being lied on and falsely accused for someone\\'s personal gain.\"  Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a \"money play,\" Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.  However, in this instance it appears he\\'s gotten off easy. Songz still isn\\'t off the hook yet, as his case is now being referred to the L.A.

So it comes as no surprise that the Maleficent star is pushing to finalise her divorce to Brad and moving their six kids – Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine – to the U.K in time for the wedding.

Katy Perry, 33, and Orlando Bloom, 41, reportedly had a quickie wedding in Prague! “Word in her inner circle is that her recent trip to Prague to visit him was actually an elopement,” a source tells OK! mag. “Katy has never had a connection with a man like the one she has with Orlando. Friends say neither of them wanted to waste more time apart.” While visiting Bloom in Prague — where he’s currently filming his upcoming Amazon series, Carnival Row — the mag’s source says Perry and the actor enjoyed a romantic lunch on February 28, where they cozied up together at Cafe Savoy.

Messitte has just ruled in favor of two attorney generals seeking to subpoena the Trump organization relating to President Trump unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments.D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can now subpoena the Trump organization, thereby forcing them to preserve documents in relation to President Trump’s alleged indiscretions.The case advances a very high-profile attempt to see if President Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes him from receiving gifts from foreign or state governments. The Trump Organization will be compelled to comply with the court’s ruling.“This ruling is an important first step in our litigation against President Trump for unlawfully receiving emoluments from foreign and domestic governments,” Racine said in a statement.Per the Post:Because Trump continues to benefit financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties — in some cases from clients affiliated with foreign governments — Frosh and Racine alleged in their June complaint that Trump had committed “unprecedented constitutional violations.” State spending that benefits the president may be considered a violation of the domestic emolument clause, which says the president “shall not receive” any emolument, other than fixed compensation, from “the United States, or any of them.”The Justice Department had sought to squash the subpoena earlier in September, but Judge Messitte wasn’t convinced with their argument.President Trump has been accused of profiting from the presidency, and this case will seek to prove that assertion.',\n",
       " 'Lest the Kardashians have pulled the greatest troll job on celebrity media since that time Joaquin Phoenix pretended to be a rapper, its safe to assume that Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are both pregnant , and have been for some time. Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it\\'s become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they\\'re staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they\\'re a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.  In the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It\\'s not even a question of \"if\" that\\'s interesting anymore, but rather \"how\" and \"when.... no seriously when? We\\'re all waiting. There\\'s a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.\"  Well, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig ) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, \"Let\\'s raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner.\" Then they run through matters of Rob\\'s whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall\\'s anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, \"Did you guys hear what\\'s on TMZ?\" Then Kourtney says, \"I\\'m so sick of people like not saying anything.\" (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there\\'s tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.  So, perhaps that\\'s how the Khloé konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family\\'s show.  That leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family\\'s Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khloé made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?  Here\\'s another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What\\'s another few weeks at this point?

       " \"CLOSE The Rock, Zac Efron and Priyanka Chopra pick up where David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson left off as they try to rejuvenate the lifeguard program amid budget cuts. Paramount Pictures  Dwayne Johnson, left, and Zac Efron are hard-bodied lifesavers in the comedy 'Baywatch.' (Photo: Frank Masi)  The big-screen version of Baywatch peaks early with its silliness right in the opening credits: A stern-looking Dwayne Johnson saves someone while dolphins high five each other with flippers and a title treatment hovers heroically in Godzilla-sized type.  Unfortunately, nothing after that is as lovably ridiculous in this new paean to the 1990s Z-grade TV hit with David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. This Baywatch (** out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Thursday night) has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they’re beating a dead seahorse.  The comedy directed by Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) rests on the boulder shoulders of The Rock, who plays the old Hoff role of Baywatch honcho Mitch Buchannon. Instead of just giving out random suntan-lotion rubdowns and helping the occasional victim of a bad wave, these lifeguards are part-time superheroes who take on fiery boat accidents, jewelry-stealing grifters and rampant drug dealing along their beloved Emerald Bay. When a passerby asks Mitch if he’s Batman, our hero responds, “Sure, pal. Just bigger. And browner.”  The archetypal Baywatch crew — including second-in-command Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), athletic Summer (Alexandra Daddario), good-hearted CJ (Kelly Rohrbach) and nerdy Ronnie (Jon Bass) — have a difficult time getting on the same page with the addition of new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a disgraced Olympic swimming champion hired to the team as a PR stunt. Mitch and Brody clash often, trash-talking each other endlessly and engaging in physical competitions (like hauling fridges), but have to put their macho egos in check to stop local businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) and the femme fatale’s nefarious plans to take over the bay.  Priyanka Chopra stars as villainess Victoria Leeds in 'Baywatch.' (Photo: Frank Masi)  Brandishing bods that’ll make you question your own fitness decisions, Johnson and Efron are at least fun to watch — Mitch reads as a little too serious, though Brody makes up for it as an overly self-confident goof who spends much of the movie wondering why they just don’t call the cops. Daddario adds a surprising deft comedic touch as well: A scene where Mitch, Brody and Summer investigate the morgue Scooby-Doo style is one of the few times when Baywatch really shines.  Everything one would expect in a Baywatch movie — cleavage, bouncing body parts, constant flexing and the excessive use of slo-mo — is present. (Plus, a couple of the old TV cast members show up for cameos.) Yet the remake yearns to be both sendup farce and straight action film, tripping along the way and failing to grasp either. When the plastic aquarium version of the usually ultra-charismatic Johnson gets more laughs than the real deal, there’s something seriously wrong.  A lot of the humor just doesn’t connect and tries way too hard, from one dude getting his junk stuck in a beach chair to a running gag involving salad. Chopra, whose villainess seems bored by the whole situation, would rather be eviling it up in a James Bond movie, and the fireworks-laden climax is full of punch but leans predictable and lacks excitement.  This flick might be bigger than the original Baywatch — from the production budget to its stars' muscles — but lacks the cheesy fun.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rNPNsD\",\n",

       " 'According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.  Prince Harry: ‘There Is Much More We Can Do’ To Promote Mental Health Awareness  Speaking at a panel event entitled “Encouraging Happy Young Minds” in Leeds, the prince suggested that young people need to take a moment to think things over before moving on. “I read recently that young people check their phones at least 150 times a day,” he said. “I’m sure we could all be more effective and efficient if we took a moment to process our thoughts rather than rush to the next one.”  Prince Harry, along with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have spearheaded new mental health campaign, Head Together, which has initiated important conversation around the country.  “I cannot tell you how pleased William, Catherine and I are that the dial seems to have shifted and that there is now a greater understanding, compassion and kindness for anyone who opens up about their struggles.  “But let’s not kid ourselves that the job is done – there is much more that we can do at every level to make conversations about mental health as commonplace as those about physical health.”  Mental health awareness is a subject close to his heart.

       " 'Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Eun Kyung Kim  One of the world\\'s most eligible bachelors just took himself off the market.  Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace announced in a statement Monday.  “His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” according to the palace statement. The couple got engaged earlier this month in London. Prince Harry also \"sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle\\'s parents,\" the palace said.  Several hours later, the couple appeared hand-in-hand for a brief photo opportunity in the gardens of Kensington Palace, where a beaming prince said he realized Markle was the one for him \"the first time we met.\"  The couple plan to get married next May at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle. They will live in Nottingham Cottage, Harry\\'s apartment at Kensington Palace.  Markle is a 36-year-old California native emerged from relative obscurity after news began to leak in the fall of 2016 that she was dating Prince Harry, 33.  The couple dated for more than a year before making their first official appearance together this past September at the Invictus Games in Toronto.  The newly betrothed couple, during their first public appearance together on Sept. 25, 2017, at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The pair met in early July 2016 after being set up on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, the couple told the BBC in a joint interview. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal.  The happy couple, at a photo call with reporters Monday after news broke about their engagement. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The couple kept quiet about their relationship until Prince Harry issued a rare statement last November scolding paparazzi for endangering the safety of his girlfriend and blasting coverage he found racist and sexist.  But even after that announcement, the couple did not make any public appearances together until this past May when the two appeared at a polo match benefiting two of Prince Harry’s charities. Markle cheered on Harry as he played, but the two did not arrive or leave the event together.  Shutterstock / MEGA  For the September opening ceremony for this year\\'s Invictus Games, the two originally sat several rows apart, but the couple stepped out publicly for the first time just days later, when they arrived, holding hands, for a wheelchair tennis match. They were seen laughing and being affectionate with each other throughout the event.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle in early November, while the couple enjoyed a “cozy” night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken.  “It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,” Markle said in a BBC interview following the announcement of their engagement.  The impending nuptials will be the biggest royal wedding since Harry\\'s older brother, Prince William, married the former Kate Middleton on April 29, 2011.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement they were “very excited for Harry and Meghan.”  “It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,” they said.  Prince Harry\\'s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also issued congratulations through Twitter.  \"The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness,\" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring he designed with a center diamond from Botswana, where the two visited on vacation shortly after they met, and two outside diamonds from the personal collection of the Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana.  It also will be the first time an American has married a British royal since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced socialite. Like Simpson, Markle also is a divorcee. She was previously married to American film producer Trevor Engelson for nearly two years, divorcing in 2013.  In May, Prince Harry brought Markle as his date to the wedding reception of Kate\\'s younger sister, Pippa Middleton. Royal watchers believe their attendance signaled how serious the relationship had become since it marked the first time Markle had mingled at a large gathering of royal family members.  Prince Harry is the fifth in line to the throne, behind the two children of his brother, Prince William, who is second in the line of succession behind their father. He will be bumped to sixth in line following the birth of William\\'s third child next year.  Before he began dating Markle, the prince\\'s romantic life had been calm and quiet for the past several years after a string of high-profile relationships. His most recent serious relationship, with model Cressida Bonas, ended in 2014 after two years together.  Follow Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter or Facebook.',\n",

       " 'If you\\'ve spent hours in the gym hoping to squat your way to a Kardashian-esque butt, you\\'ve probably wondered if there\\'s a quicker and easier way.  Turns out butt augmentation is one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgical procedures performed in the country, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Derrière implants increased by 18 percent between 2015 and 2016, while fat grafting procedures (where they literally inject more fat into your keister) jumped 26 percent during the same period.  In total, 20,673 butt augmentation procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2017, per soon-to-be-published data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andrew Ordon, M.D., a co-host on The Doctors, even declared 2017 \"the year of the rear.\"  Yet Ordon admits not all his patients are happy after having these procedures—and a few have even come back requesting reversals. So is butt augmentation really worth it?  There are a few things you should know before springing for this pricey procedure:  Fat Grafting Is The Most Popular (And Best!) Method  Getty Images  Fat grafting is the most popular method of butt augmentation. With fat grafting, also called the Brazilian butt lift, the doctor starts by performing liposuction—removing fat from an area where it’s not wanted, like the stomach, thighs, or upper back, and injects it into the buttocks. Results are immediately visible, but you won’t see the final product until a year after surgery; it takes time for the body to form new blood vessels and truly incorporate the grafted fat.  There are risks like blood clots, sensation changes, and fat embolism (when fat is released into the blood stream), but most experts advocate fat grafting as the number-one option for butt augmentation. It has a low risk of infection and, if you do gain weight down the line, it will grow with you, says Alexes Hazen, M.D., a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The average cost of fat grafting is $4,356, per the ASPS; most health insurance companies won\\'t cover it.  You Can Also Opt For Silicone Implants  Getty Images  Very thin patients who don’t have enough fat for liposuction might not be eligible for fat grafting, and these are the women who make good candidates for implants, says Mark Mofid, M.D., a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, California, and an ASAPS member.  Butt implants require a multi-hour outpatient surgery in which a surgeon inserts silicone implants into your tuchus. On butt-implant delivery day, your surgeon will make an incision within the vertical butt crease and then slide silicone implants either into or above the gluteal muscle on each side. Placement technique varies among doctors, but intramuscular implants are ideal, says Mofid.  “Most of the patients who have had implants and are unhappy with them have on-top-of-the-muscle implants,” Mofid says. “That’s just not a great place for an implant to be. Those implants sag over time and kind of look like gumdrops on the buttocks, as opposed to a much more natural look.”  Surgeons typically use the approach they’re most comfortable with, so if you’re considering the procedure, ask your doctor what type of placement he or she uses, he recommends. And, FYI, butt implants cost around $4,860, according to 2016 statistics from ASPS; most health insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic surgery or resulting complications.  The Bigger The Implant, The Bigger The Risk  Getty Images  Most women go into the initial consultation with an idea of what kind of butt they’re trying to achieve, but Mofid cautions against going too large. He says he won’t do implants bigger than 350 cubic centimeters, which equals roughly one and a half cups of fluid—even when patients beg, as they sometimes do—because it’s too “fraught with risks.”  Large implants have higher rates of incisions that split open post-surgery and implants that shift around under the skin. (But more on that next.)  In 2013, Mofid co-authored a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that analyzed the experience of 2,226 people who received butt implants. Among all patients, 848—or 38 percent—reported complications.  The most common side effect reported in the PRS study was incisional separation (7.9 percent of patients)—“people bend and stoop and the incision can separate,” Mofid says. About 5 percent of patients needed an implant revision, and 4.2 percent experienced pain that lasted more than 12 weeks. Nearly 4 percent developed seromas, which means fluid builds up under the skin, and 3.6 percent had minor infection that didn’t require the implants to be removed. Implant removal was necessary in 3.8 percent of patients for reasons like major infection, chronic pain, and chronic seromas, according to the study findings.  Hazen says that plastic surgeons have mixed feelings about butt augmentation, but she’s not a fan. “Just anatomically where they go—you’re sitting on it all the time,” Hazen says. “It’s hard to imagine that it would be comfortable.”  Switch up your squat with these 20 variations that will help you tone your butt:  \\u200b  Recovery is rough—No matter the method  Getty Images  Whether you opt for fat grafting or implants, you can\\'t sit or lie on your back for three weeks post butt-augmentation, says Mofid, which generally rules out things like work and school (and maybe comfortable sleeping). “Normal life is put on hold,” he says. “You’ve got to be committed to this operation. It’s not for the faint of heart.”  If you’re determined to go through with the procedure, vet your surgeon and facility carefully. Check prospective doctors’ websites to see before and after photos of their patients, and talk to other women who’ve gotten implants, Hazen suggests. Always opt for a board-certified plastic surgeon who has ample experience, and be sure to ask questions like how your butt will look over time, whether you’re a good candidate for the surgery and what the options are if you’re dissatisfied with the outcome.  And don’t be lured by unscrupulous doctors or facilities in foreign countries hawking cheaper procedures. “Don’t cheap out and go someplace because it’s inexpensive,” Hazen says. “This is your body, this is forever, it’s important, so go to somebody good. You want an accredited facility, not just the back of some guy’s office.”  Whatever you do, don\\'t get silicone injections  Getty Images  In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using silicone injections for purposes like body contouring. The warning was issued in response to an increase in cases of patients receiving illegal silicone injections from unlicensed medical professionals in private homes or hotels. Often called \"pumping parties,\" these services are marketed as a cheaper alternative to plastic surgery.  The risks of illegal silicone injections are even worse than you\\'d think: Loose silicone—as opposed to silicone used as enclosed implants—can be dangerous and even fatal; injections can cause disfigurement or significant scarring. “It should be uniformly condemned,” Mofid says. “There’s no place for it in medicine—virtually 100 percent of patients over their lifetime will develop problems.”  Squats might actually be your best option  Getty Images  Surgery offers the lure of a quick fix, but it’s risky, expensive, and, well, extreme. Ordon reminds those who crave a larger posterior that they can get one naturally. He recommends performing exercises that target the glutes, such as squats and leg raises. In short, augmentation might seem like a quick fix—but a butt workout is probably still the best way.',\n",
       " 'Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner became parents in early February. Jason Kempin/Getty Images  Kylie Jenner recently posted a photo of herself holding her 4-month-old daughter, Stormi, in a Gucci baby carrier.  E! News reports that the high-end item has an estimated retail value of $820.  Many commenters, however, were more concerned with the comfort and safety of the carrier, suggesting that it is the wrong \"shape\" and that it looks \"unhealthy.\"  Pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert told INSIDER that it\\'s difficult to judge Stormi\\'s safety by the photo alone, but it\\'s possible her legs are not in the proper position.  Kylie Jenner has suddenly become shy about showcasing her daughter, Stormi Webster. The 20-year-old mom recently deleted every Instagram photo that gave fans a look at Stormi\\'s face head-on.  It\\'s not difficult to see why she may be feeling protective. From rumors about Stormi\\'s true parentage to weirdly specific photoshop accusations, it seems that everyone with a social media account has an opinion on the 4-month-old baby. In keeping with this theme, the most recent photo of Jenner holding her daughter has predictably caught plenty of negative attention.  Although the photo does not show Stormi\\'s face, it does show the new mom holding her daughter in a Gucci carrier — one that has an estimated retail value of $820, according to E! News. (If you have a baby and nearly a grand to drop, you\\'re out of luck; it\\'s already sold out.)  Many fans commented to tell Jenner that she looks \"adorable\" and \"natural.\" Many others, however, took issue with the way Stormi is being cradled — specifically taking issue with the carrier itself, calling it \"awful,\" \"uncomfortable,\" and claiming that it\\'s the wrong \"shape.\"  Multiple comments chided the young mom for not choosing an \"ergonomic\" design, which essentially means that it\\'s both comfortable for the parent and supportive for the child.  \"Non ergonomic. It isn\\'t safe. You\\'re hurting Stormi,\" one person wrote.  \"Maybe you would be able to extend this sweet moment in better comfort for both of you with an ergonomic babycarrier,\" another wrote. \"You\\'ll find very smart ones that would respect Stormi\\'s body and prevents you for suffering of back pain.\"  Other commenters were less specific with their criticisms.  \"This isn\\'t a safe carrier, so she obviously didn\\'t get a safe carrier for her baby. She got a Gucci carrier so she could look cool,\" one comment reads.  \"OMG POOR BABY....ITS NOT HEALTHY FOR HER,\" reads another.  It\\'s not clear exactly what aspect of the photo or carrier these comments were referencing. It\\'s possible that they are concerned about Stormi\\'s head and neck not seeming completely supported, but BabyCenter reports that babies are typically able to hold their own heads up at 4 months old. The skinny leather straps also seem less than comfortable for the new mom\\'s shoulders.  Another possibility, according to pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert, is the positioning of Stormi\\'s legs.  \"What people may be criticizing is the baby\\'s leg position. In a baby carrier, it is best for baby\\'s hips to be slightly flexed when carried rather than dangling straight down,\" Burgert told INSIDER in an email. \"If the baby is carried with legs straight for a prolonged period, this puts her at risk for hip problems (developmental hip dysplasia).  \"In this photo, it is not possible to tell if her legs are truly flexed, so we can leave the firm criticism at the door,\" Burgert said. \"But, the carrier itself does seem very narrow at the bottom, likely not allowing for the best infant positioning.\"  Burgert also noted, understandably, that she is skeptical whether Gucci is \"known for making the best baby carriers\" — and luxury consignment websites offer little detail about its safety features.  Despite this, the New York Times noted in 2010 that, while wraps and baby carriers are traditional in many parts of the world, celebrities have made it so that \"\\'wearing\\' one\\'s baby has taken on a certain cachet,\" prompting a widespread use of \"upscale versions.\"  Of course, this is not the first time Jenner has opted for designer baby goods. The reality star posted a photo in April of herself pushing Stormi in a Fendi stroller.  According to Burgert, deciding to use either a stroller or baby carrier is \"simply a family decision for what works best,\" as there is no evidence-based research to suggest that one is better than the other.  For parents who do prefer baby carriers though, Burgert recommends choosing a high-quality carrier that offers butt and hip support, keeping the baby\\'s legs in a flexed position.  \"The baby\\'s legs should be slightly spread and the carrier should support he leg from thigh to knee joint,\" she told INSIDER, adding that the baby \"should be facing the parent until at least 6 months.\" Parents should also keep in mind that babies need time to stretch out at regular intervals, and they should be diligent about applying sunscreen to the arms and legs.

       " 'Was there ever any doubt that Stephen Colbert would use his platform at the Emmys to knock Donald Trump? The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman’s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.  For his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid’s Tale. The chorus? “Everything is better on TV”—including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, “treason.” Once he finally took the stage—along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids—Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn’t take long to get to the Trump jokes: “If he had won an Emmy,” Colbert quipped, “I bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he’s just Walter, much whiter.”  “Unlike the presidency,” Colbert added, “Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Still, Colbert couldn’t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.  Although he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala’s crowd size: “This is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,” Spicer said with a straight face. “Both in person and around the world.”  “Wow,” Colbert said, “that really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.”  In the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.  Will the president respond? We’ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we’re not frantically analyzing tonight’s wins and snubs—although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won’t come before two in the morning.

       " 'Angelina Jolie\\'s changing physique has been alarming fans throughout the year. The actress has lost a drastic amount of weight following her split from Brad Pitt and now, a new rumour claims that the actress is also stopped eating and sleeping properly.  There are rumours doing the rounds claiming that Jolie is undergoing \\'health crisis\\' and is \"on the verge of passing out.\" The claims published by National Enquirer say that the actress is surviving on steamed vegetables and fruits. However, Gossip Cop sources say otherwise.  Also Read: Brad Pitt feels \\'better off without\\' Angelina Jolie as she delays divorce?  National Enquirer\\'s grapevine claims that the actress is on the \"edge of a total collapse\" as she barely eats. \"There are times she feels light-headed and is on the verge of passing out,\" the insider claims.  The outlet\\'s source adds that Jolie\\'s \"food intake is mostly morsels of steamed veggies and fruit, very little protein, and water. She drinks wine and smokes cigarettes. The fear is she\\'s headed for a physical meltdown.\"  Although it is true that Jolie has been had some health issues in the past, Gossip Cop\\'s sources debunk these claims to share that the National Enquirer\\'s report is not true. Friends of the actress told the gossip site that there is no truth in the claims.  While she might not be headed for a physical breakdown, Jolie has informed fans that she has had a few health issues she has been dealing with. In a recent interview, the actress did confess to suffering from hypertension but fortunately recovered from it.  \"Emotionally it\\'s been a very difficult year. And I have some other health issues. So, my health is something I have to monitor,\" she told the Sunday Telegraph.  Earlier this year, the star also revealed that she had developed Bell\\'s palsy. But she changed her lifestyle and took control of things. \"I\\'m being smart about my choices, and I\\'m putting my family first, and I\\'m in charge of my life and my health,\" the actress told Vanity Fair.  \"I can\\'t tell if it\\'s menopause or if it\\'s just been the year I\\'ve had,\" she had told the magazine referring to her drier skin and grey strands.',\n",

       " 'Whenever an awards show takes place in the midst of a charged political climate, it’s always the topical speeches that define the night.  This year’s Emmy Awards honored TV’s current politicized landscape, so naturally winners from The Crown’s John Lithgow to Master of None’s Lena Waithe embraced the opportunity to make a statement on Sunday night. The most common target was, unsurprisingly, the president, who has had a troubled relationship with celebrities and awards shows — including the Emmys. Some went hard against the Trump administration, while others skipped the takedowns, and instead highlighted causes and marginalized groups.  Here are all the moments when honorees and presenters got topical:  Stephen Colbert was right at home  The evening’s host had a prescription for those struggling with the tumultuous news cycle: watch TV! He opened the ceremony with the musical number “Everything Is Better on TV,” running through this year’s sizable roster of options for escapism with cameos from the likes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chance the Rapper. Of course there were digs about how House of Cards is beginning to feel like real life. The big finish: a battalion of Handmaid’s Tale showgirls topped off the spectacle.  Colbert even looked at the camera and addressed President Trump directly. “Hello sir. Thank you for joining us. Looking forward to the tweets,” he said. The hits only got more pointed from there.  “However you feel about the president, every show was influenced by Trump in some way. All the late night shows, obviously. House of Cards, the new season of American Horror Story, and of course next year’s Latin Grammys hosted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio.”  Predictably, Colbert made a meal out of Trump complaining about his failure to snag an Emmy for his reality TV series Celebrity Apprentice.  “If he had won an Emmy I bet he wouldn’t have run for president. So in a way, this was all your fault,” Colbert said. “I thought you people loved morally compromised anti-heroes. You loved Walter White. He’s just Walter much whiter.”  Colbert hit Trump’s “The Emmys are rigged” gripe hard by playing actual footage from the presidential debate when Trump peppered in his remark that “I should have gotten it,” while Hillary Clinton was attacking Trump about his Emmy snub complaints.  But Trump doesn’t have an Emmy, because as the host explained to huge applause, “Unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.”  Sean Spicer rolled onstage  Colbert then segued into the cameo of the night. “Of course what really matters to Trump is ratings. You got to have the big numbers. We have no way of knowing how big our audience is. Sean, do you know?”  The audience lost it as Trump’s former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer came out to assess the crowd size. When asked about how many eyeballs were on the show, Spicer delivered: “This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys period — both in person and around the world,” referencing his own controversial responses to contested reports about Trump’s inauguration crowd size.  Targets who weren’t Trump  Colbert also went after Senator Ted Cruz’s recent Twitter debacle. “Everyone loves streaming video. Just ask Ted Cruz,” he said, referencing the fact that Cruz’s Twitter account recently “liked” a tweet from a porn account. “But knock first. You don’t want to just walk in.”  It wasn’t all about politicians, though. Colbert also blasted Real Time host and Emmy nominee Bill Maher for his controversial use of the N-word.  John Lithgow nods to history  The Crown’s Lithgow praised his character Winston Churchill’s leadership in his supporting actor acceptance speech. “In these crazy times, his life reminds us what courage and leadership in government looks like.”  Saturday Night Live players address their political counterparts  A tearful Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton, the main subject of her own political satire on Saturday Night Live, for her “grace and grit.”  Alec Baldwin opened his acceptance speech, for his SNL performance as Trump, with a dig about POTUS: “At long last I suppose I should say, here, Mr. President, is your Emmy.”  9 to 5 Reunion  The cast of the 1980 movie 9 to 5 — Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda — used their platform as presenters to take a stab at Trump, too. “In 1980, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,” Fonda opened. “And in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,” Tomlin added.  Lena Waithe’s emotional speech  After a standing ovation, Master of None’s Lena Waithe accepted the award for Outstanding Writing of a Comedy Series with a message for her “LGBTQIA family:” “I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers — every day when you walk out the door and put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren’t in it. And for everybody out there that showed so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago.”  Donald Glover actually thanked POTUS in his second speech  Atlanta auteur Glover gave Trump a shout-out for activating him. “I wanna thank Trump for making black people the number one most oppressed group. He’s the reason I’m probably up here.”  Veep‘s political moment  Emmy darling Julia Louis-Dreyfus won for her leading role on Veep, the HBO comedy about incompetence in the White House, and included a reference to POTUS. “We did have a whole storyline about impeachment but we abandoned that because we were worried someone else might get to it first.”  Riz Ahmed gave his causes a powerful dose of publicity  When Ahmed won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie for The Night Of, he used his speech to drive home a point. “If this show has shone a light on some of the prejudice in our societies, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, maybe that’s something. I will shout out South Asian Youth Action for helping me prepare for this, and the Innocence Project.”  Nicole Kidman propelled domestic violence to the top of the agenda  After winning an Emmy for her powerful portrayal of a domestic abuse survivor on Big Little Lies, Kidman closed her acceptance speech with a call to action. “We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know, it is filled with shame and secrecy and by you acknowledging me with this award it shines a light on it even more.”',\n",
       " 'A decade ago, Jennifer Lawrence was just trying to break into the game like any other up-and-coming actor.  The Mother! star apparently auditioned for Blake Lively\\'s role, Serena van der Woodsen, on the hit CW teen drama, Gossip Girl, the show\\'s creator Josh Schwartz told Vulture in an interview recently.  “We did not realize this at the time, but Jennifer Lawrence really wanted to play Serena and auditioned,” Schwartz revealed. “This story came to us secondhand, but we were told she definitely auditioned and was bummed to not get it.”  While Lawrence didn\\'t get to star as a socialite on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side, things seem to have turned out just fine.

Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the “hate our troops” bandwagon and made a “black power” fist – a gesture assembled with black supremacist groups – during the National Anthem.Brown was counting on P.C. culture winning out and letting him keep his job, but what happened next ruined his life.“This is not, and has never been, about the military or disrespecting the flag,” Brown said in an interview with ESPN after he raised his fist. “It is about police brutality, racial injustice, and inequality in this country. It is something that I as well as many others feel needs to be addressed. I love my country, but that doesn’t mean I cannot acknowledge that it is not perfect.”Unfortunately, the owner of the team disagrees. Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.“We wish Mr. Brown the best, but we feel that he does not embody the values of the Tampa Bay Lightning,” Lancaster says. “We support our country, we support our troops, we support our police, and we support our President.”Brown will continue to be paid until the end of the season as per the terms of his contract, but will then be looking for a job.',\n",

       " 'The heart wants what it wants — and Selena Gomez\\'s heart just wants her puppy back! It\\'s been almost two months since she split from her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and even though they\\'ve both moved on, there\\'s one major thing that the former couple is still fighting about — the dog that they adopted while they were still together! Sources exclusively reveal to Life & Style that Sel thinks she should keep their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel pup, Charlie, \"and so does Abel.”  “Selena is angry,” says the source, “because she feels like it was more of a gift from Abel to her than a mutually adopted pet, so she’s determined to keep it.”  Selena Gomez gave her dog Charlie a kiss while on set of her untitled film project. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Back in September — just one month before their split — Selena, 25, and Abel, 27, were spotted together at an NYC pet shop and they seemed to have picked out the puppy together. It also seemed like they shared custody of the pup even though Selena is the only one who had been spotted with Charlie in public. But it seems like Abel has grown attached to Charlie too, and he shared photos of the adorable dog on his Instagram story before their split.  Selena got Charlie just days after she announced that she had spent the summer recovering from a kidney transplant as a result of her battle with lupus, so it seems like Charlie helped her get through that health scare. But now that she\\'s feeling better, Sel is getting back to work on an untitled project with controversial filmmaker Woody Allen and that\\'s why Abel thinks he should be the one to have custody of Charlie.  “He thinks Selena won’t be able to take care of Charlie as well as he will because of her schedule,” the source says, adding that Selena isn’t listening — and she won\\'t give up Charlie without a fight. “She is in love with her puppy.”  For more on your favorite celebrities, pick up the new issue of Life & Style on stands now!

See for yourself below.  Getty Images  Getty Images  So who\\'s the lucky guy? Balfe told People she\\'s engaged to her boyfriend of almost two years, Tony McGill. The couple have kept their relationship fairly very private. As in, so private that there\\'s virtually zero evidence of McGill on the internet. Here\\'s the little of what we know about Balfe\\'s fiancé and their relationship over the past two years.  They got engaged over the holidays.  \"It happened over the break,\" Balfe revealed. \"I’m very happy.\"    Like Balfe, he\\'s Irish.  Did \"McGill\" give it away?

       " \"It's official - Jane Fonda has confirmed plans for herself, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin to return for a sequel to their movie, 9 to 5!  Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are ready to punch the clock once again as a sequel to their 1980 comedy 9 to 5 is in the works. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fonda revealed plans for the trio to team up for a modern revival.  “My role is as an executive producer, and I’m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,” Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. “Right now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.”  The film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.  “I’m sorry to say the situation is worse today,” she said. “Today a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?”  Rumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.  “All these years we’ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,” Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. “We decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we’ve all agreed that we’d love to do it if it’s right.”  Added Parton, “I told them we better get after it or it’s going to be 95 instead of 9 to 5.”  No word on when production for 9 to 5 will begin for Parton, but in the meantime, the Tennessee native has her hands full with several major projects. In addition to acting, Parton’s production company, Dixie Pixie Productions, has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and Netflix to create eight original films based on her music. The films are set to air on Netflix in 2019.\",\n",
       " \"It may no longer be a green light to consider Lorde a member of Taylor Swift’s squad.  The 20-year-old New Zealand pop star revealed to Australian Yahoo affiliate Sunrise that, for her, the allure of a celebrity friend circle doesn’t fit her social life.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I don’t hang out with these people at all,” she said, referring to the influx of famous friends she came in contact with after the success of her debut album Pure Heroine at age 16.  When the interviewer suggested that she was a member of Swift’s so-called “squad,” Lorde jokingly rolled her eyes. “You know, you make friends in different places, but I think for the most part I’m not, like, calling my idols for advice necessarily.”  Lorde, who reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with her latest album Melodrama, said the best way for her to mentally process meeting her musical heroes like Beyoncé and Swift is to pretend it’s another world.  “The second you think too hard about it, you’ll just go insane, so it’s best to be like, ‘We’re in wonderland and it’s just what happens around here,'” she said.  She and the 1989 songstress seem to have a close bond. In March, Swift broke her social media silence to promote Lorde’s new single, and in November, threw her a star-studded 20th birthday bash at Carbone in New York City.

Lorde received backlash last month when she compared her friendship with Swift to a disease during an interview with the Guardian, trying to express the challenges of staying close with someone so famous.  “It’s like having a friend with very specific allergies. There are certain places you can’t go together; certain things you can’t do,” she said. “There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship — it’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”  Lorde eventually apologized for the comment on Twitter, writing that she “f—– up & it was really insensitive.”  didn't mention taylor, but regardless, i fucked up & that was really insensitive. i'm sorry 🌹 — Lorde (@lorde) June 20, 2017  Attention to Swift’s so-called “squad” mostly began in 2015 after the release of her star-studded “Bad Blood” music video, which featured Selena Gomez, Zendaya, Lena Dunham and Gigi Hadid, among others.\",\n",

       " 'Let\\'s face it. The franchise just hasn\\'t been the same since fan favorite NeNe Leakes departed The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after Season 7. But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?  The explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she\\'s rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo\\'s The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. \"I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I\\'m back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!\" she said.  Fans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn\\'t return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.  In 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had \"been lifted off of [her] shoulders.\" That\\'s no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn\\'t start all of them. Nonetheless, NeNe officially traded in her peach in 2015.  “This was definitely a hard decision for me,” Leakes told People at the time. “Me and my husband [Gregg Leakes] have been going back and forth on it for weeks now. But my contract is up and I just think this is the right time. This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do different things.” The announcement for her departure came on the heels of news that Leakes would be focusing on other projects. She had previously guest starred on the hit FOX series Glee and NBC\\'s The New Normal. Soon after leaving RHOA she made her Broadway debut as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella, alongside actress Keke Palmer.  But regardless of why she originally left the reality series, longtime RHOA viewers are super excited to see NeNe back in the group. She\\'ll be reuniting with fellow Housewives Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Shereé Whitfield, and Porsha Williams. Also returning to the show, both in a part-time capacity, are Kim Zolciak-Biermann and newcomer model-actor Eva Marcille. Kim was an original Housewife along with NeNe, but unlike Kim, NeNe will resume her place as a full-time Housewife when the series returns on Sunday, Nov. 5.  NBC/Bravo  \"I am back and of course the haters know I\\'m here,\" NeNe says in Season 10 trailer, which means Atlanta (and particularly Porsha) better watch out. In an exclusive sneak peek on Entertainment Tonight, NeNe wastes no time inserting herself back into the drama when she candidly confronts Porsha over some nasty comments and bad blood at Cynthia\\'s 50th birthday party. And anyone who remembers NeNe\\'s previous seasons on the show knows that she\\'s not one to back down from a (verbal) fight.  So how will this crew of Southern Belles get along with NeNe back in the building? Find out when RHOA returns for Season 10.',\n",
       " 'Teresa Giudice has been known for her zen, namaste attitude after returning from her 11-month prison stay. But on Wednesday’s Real Housewives of New Jersey, the mother of four got back to her table-flipping ways when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice.  As viewers know, Joe is currently away serving a 41-month prison sentence — giving Teresa an opportunity to find romance with other people, longtime RHONJ guest Kim DePaola claimed. “I hear since Joe went away that she’s rekindling old frames,” she told Housewives Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania while prepping for the fashion show at her fashion boutique, Posche.  “It’s not a rumor ’cause you’re going to find out it’s not,” DePaola added. “I’ll bet Posche on it right now. I think he treated her horribly and I was happy that she’s moving on!”  She may have been certain with her allegations, but Teresa sure found fault with the claims when Flicker and Catania passed them back to her.  “I’m f—— fuming right now. I’m f—— fuming,” Teresa, 45, told the duo while at a group dinner with fellow New Jersey Housewives Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs and Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub.  “She’s such a f—— bitch!” Teresa screamed of DePaola, later throwing a glass against the restaurant’s wall behind her. “It’s not f—— true! Are you kidding me, it’s not true!”  Teresa and Joe Giudice Paul Zimmerman/Getty  Flicker and Catania sure didn’t believe DePaola when they first heard the claims. “What are you talking about right now? Doesn’t matter, ’cause you know what rumors are? Just rumors!” Flicker said. “That’s all rumors. He’s not cheating and there’s no proof of it. Anybody can say anything, unless you have a picture of the wee-wee entering the cookie, who gives a s—? … People need to mind their own business. This woman has been through hell and back and she’s out there doing events, making money, and working her butt off for her children!”  “Kim D’s always been a good friend to me, but spreading rumors about people’s marriages or their children is hitting below the belt,” Flicker told viewers.  Added Catania: “There aren’t any old flames — Joe’s the only man she’s ever been with!”  Kim DePaola Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images)  Still, when she heard about DePaola’s claims from her friends, Giudice was certain that Catania — whom she has known for 20 years — hadn’t had her back. “You should have f—— stuck up for me,” Giudice yelled at Catania. “[Siggy] said [she] did, I don’t know if [you] did.”  That accusation pushed Catania off the ledge. “I did! When is enough enough? Huh? When is it a-f—— ’nuff?” Catania asked, bringing up Giudice’s decision to believe Danielle Staub over her in a previous argument. “I stuck up for you. Did you stick up for me against Danielle? I did and you didn’t. I did, and don’t think I will again.”  “We did stick up for you!” Flicker reinforced. “I yelled, ‘It’s a rumor and it’s heresy, shut your mouth!’ We said it wasn’t true.”  Dolores Catania and Siggy Flicker Marcus Owen/startraksphoto.com  Their words weren’t enough for Giudice and Gorga, who have a long history of feuding with DePaula and were angry that Flicker and Catania were still going to walk in DePaola’s upcoming fashion show — an event thrown to help raise money for charity.  “This is so crazy to me. Not only has Kim D done what she’s done for all these years to hurt me and my family, but now on top of it, she’s saying that Teresa’s a cheater. And Siggy and Dolores still are gonna go and support this woman?” Gorga asked viewers. “I’m completely baffled by it. Everything that they say they stand for to me is bulls—.  “Yous two are f—— going and walking in her f—— show? Are you f—— kidding me?” Giudice asked.  “Dolores, we don’t live in Switzerland. You gotta pick a side. This is your friend. Welcome to New Jersey,” Gorga said. “I have been called a stripper, a whore, I have been told my husband is a piece of s— and that my children are a piece of s—. Don’t you see what this vile human is?”  RELATED VIDEO: What Advice Would Teresa Giudice Give Herself Before Joining ‘RHONJ’?  But Catania wasn’t backing down. “You don’t tell me what to do,” she told Gorga, before walking out with Flicker. “I pity Teresa for not seeing that I am the truest friend that she has. Teresa, guess what — you’ve been much closer to Kim D than I’ve ever been. Not too long ago, you and Kim D were spreading rumors about Melissa. So now the hypocrites that they are are turning on me. I don’t get it.”  Without them by her side, Giudice decided that she, Gorga, Josephs and Staub were going to go to the Posche show next week and confront DePaola. “I can’t believe that f—— bitch said that. I can’t believe they’re f—— supporting her after what she did to you, what she did to me. It’s just pretty screwed up,” Giudice said. “I think I need to go there and confront this f—— bitch.”  Her friends were by her side. “The line in the sand has been drawn!” Staub said.

       " 'Harry Styles has a unique sense of style ... or does he? The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after \\'90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain , who was one of his mom\\'s favorite artists when he was growing up.  \"I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she\\'s amazing,\" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight .  It\\'s a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon — both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.  Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town \\'s \" Girl Crush \" during a show at Nashville\\'s Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is \"one of my favorite songs recently that\\'s come out of this place,\" meaning Nashville.  He\\'ll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour . Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton , citing himself as a \"massive fan.\" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson , who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it \"something real.\"  Twain\\'s latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002\\'s massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017.

       " 'Mariah Carey\\'s \\'All I Want for Christmas Is You\\' Hits Hot 100\\'s Top 10 for First Time, \\'Perfect\\' Still No. 1  The holiday classic, released in 1994, dashes from No. 11 to No. 9. Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran & Beyoncé\\'s \"Perfect\" leads for a second week and Migos, Nicki Minaj & Cardi B\\'s \"MotorSport\" also zooms to the top 10.  Mariah Carey\\'s \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" hits the Billboard Hot 100\\'s top 10 at last, jingling from No. 11 (its prior peak) to No. 9 on the chart dated Dec. 30. The modern yuletide classic reaches the top 10 for the first time 23 years after its 1994 release.  Atop the Hot 100, Ed Sheeran and Beyoncé\\'s \"Perfect\" reigns for a second week. Plus, Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B\\'s \"MotorSport\" accelerates 15-6 for its first week in the top 10 following the premiere of its official video.  As we do every Monday, let\\'s run down the top 10 of the Hot 100, which blends all-genre streaming, airplay and sales data. All charts will update on Billboard.com tomorrow (Dec. 19).  Let\\'s start with a blizzard of chart stats about Carey\\'s \"Christmas.\"  Streams, Sales & Plays: First, the numbers that result in \"Christmas\" (on Columbia/Legacy Records and co-written and co-produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff) hitting the Hot 100\\'s top 10. The song gains by 4 percent to 25.2 million U.S. streams in the week ending Dec. 14, according to Nielsen Music; dips 8 percent to 19,000 downloads sold in the same tracking span; and lifts 28 percent to 34 million in airplay audience in the week ending Dec. 17. Those totals place \"Christmas\" at No. 7 on the Streaming Songs chart, No. 13 on Digital Song Sales and No. 36 on Radio Songs.  Notably, streaming is the most prominent driver of the song, accounting for 70 percent of its chart points this week.  Carey\\'s 28th Top 10: Carey collects her 28th Hot 100 top 10. \"Christmas\" is her first since \"Obsessed\" reached No. 7 in 2009. She tallied 19 top 10s in the 1990s and eight in the 2000s. (Of those, 18 hit No. 1, the most among soloists; only The Beatles have more, with 20.)  Carey ties Stevie Wonder for the fifth-most Hot 100 top 10s in the chart\\'s history (which dates to its Aug. 4, 1958, inception):  Most Top 10 Hot 100 Hits  38, Madonna  34, The Beatles  31, Rihanna  29, Michael Jackson  28, Mariah Carey  28, Stevie Wonder  27, Janet Jackson  27, Elton John  Top 10s in the \\'90s, \\'00s & \\'10s: Carey joins an elite list of acts with Hot 100 top 10s in the \\'90s, \\'00s & \\'10s. Its previously-inducted members: Christina Aguilera, Dr. Dre, Whitney Houston, Enrique Iglesias, Michael Jackson, JAY-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, Snoop Dogg, Britney Spears and Usher. Two of those acts boast streaks dating even further back than the \\'90s: Jackson (\\'70s-\\'10s) and Madonna (\\'80s-\\'10s).  (As for Houston, she charted top 10s in the \\'80s, \\'90s and \\'00s and re-sent her 1992-93 No. 1 \"I Will Always Love You\" to No. 3 in 2012 following her passing that February. All the other acts above sent at least one song to the top 10 for the first time in each decade.)  \\'Christmas\\' in the Top 10: Perhaps surprisingly, Carey charts one of the few holiday top 10s in the Hot 100\\'s history. \"The Chipmunk Song\" by The Chipmunks with David Seville led for four weeks beginning Dec. 22, 1958; Dan Fogelberg\\'s \"Same Old Lang Syne\" reached No. 9 in February 1981 (after debuting in December 1980); and New Kids on the Block\\'s \"This One\\'s for the Children\" rose to No. 7 in the 1989-90 holiday season.  No other such song reached the top 10 until Kenny G\\'s \"Auld Lang Syne\" (No. 7, Jan. 8, 2000). Between that New Year\\'s Eve anthem and Carey\\'s \"Christmas,\" Justin Bieber came closest to the top 10 with \"Mistletoe,\" which hit No. 11 (Jan. 5, 2011).  Carey\\'s hit is, thus, the first Hot 100 top 10 with the word \"Christmas\" in its title.  Notably, for several years in the Hot 100\\'s history (1963-72; 1983-85, barring occasional exceptions), holiday songs were not eligible to chart, instead appearing on separate holiday rankings. Other classics fell just shy of the Hot 100\\'s top 10, including The Harry Simeone Chorale\\'s \"Little Drummer Boy\" (No. 13, 1958); Bing Crosby\\'s \"White Christmas\" (No. 12, 1962, after it was originally released in 1942); Brenda Lee\\'s \"Rockin\\' Around the Christmas Tree\" (No. 14, 1960); Roy Orbison\\'s \"Pretty Paper\" (No. 15, 1964); Eagles\\' \"Please Come Home for Christmas\" (No. 18, 1979); Band-Aid\\'s \"Do They Know It\\'s Christmas?\" (No. 13, 1985); and Aguilera\\'s \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)\" (No. 18, 2000).  (Honorable mention to Adam Sandler\\'s \"The Chanukah Song,\" the only holiday top 10 ever on the Radio Songs chart, which began in 1990. The track hit No. 10 on the tally in the 1995-96 season.)  #Lambily get into the Christmas spirit with me and stream \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" on Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music! ------ #AIWFCIY #StreamMariah https://t.co/srzJxnNUS4 pic.twitter.com/kkAUlwQnl9 — Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) December 13, 2017  As for the Chart History of Carey\\'s \\'Christmas\\': So, what are the details behind a song from 1994 just hitting the Hot 100\\'s top 10 now, for the first time?  Upon its initial release, on Carey\\'s album Merry Christmas (released on Nov. 1, 1994; coincidentally, that marked the 100th anniversary of the first Billboard magazine, dated Nov. 1, 1894), the song was not a commercially available single and, per rules at the time, was ineligible to chart on the Hot 100; it did reach No. 12 on the Radio Songs chart that season. In December 1998, album cuts became eligible for the Hot 100 and \"Christmas\" dented the chart for the first time on Jan. 8, 2000, spending a week at No. 83.  Beginning in 2012, and coinciding with the addition of streaming to the Hot 100\\'s formula, the song has hit the Hot 100 annually, as, per current rules, older songs are eligible to debut or return if ranking in the top 50 and are gaining in multiple metrics with a significant reason for their resurgences. In the 2015-16 holiday season, \"Christmas\" hit a prior No. 11 Hot 100 high, which it matched last week before hitting the top 10 at last this week. Again, with streaming contributing 70 percent of the song\\'s Hot 100 chart points this week, the metric has clearly helped the track reach the top 10 at last.  Meanwhile, \"Christmas\" is believed to be the first song to have taken as many as 23 years from its recording to reach the Hot 100\\'s top 10.  An Even Merrier \\'Christmas\\': That two-decade-plus journey to the Hot 100\\'s top 10 for Carey\\'s \"Christmas\" has been aided by various offshoots of the song in recent years, including this year. The animated movie All I Want for Christmas Is You was released Nov. 14, four days after the arrival of its soundtrack, which includes the title song. The movie is based on a 2015 children\\'s book of the same name, inspired by the song.  A year earlier, in December 2014, Carey\\'s All I Want for Christmas Is You, a Night of Joy and Festivity, an annual residency at New York\\'s Beacon Theatre, began and she\\'s continued it each holiday season since; this year, the show expanded to include dates in Paris; Manchester, England; and Las Vegas.  Even before this decade, \"Christmas\" benefited from adult contemporary radio\\'s expansion to 24/7 yuletide music on many stations throughout the holiday season, a strategy that began around the early 2000s.  Holiday 100 Chart Queen: Beyond its new Hot 100 honor, Carey\\'s \"Christmas\" crowns the Holiday 100 chart, which ranks seasonal songs of all eras (using the same measurement metrics as the Hot 100), for a 29th week. No other song has led for more than two frames since the list\\'s 2011 launch.  Of course, there are nine other songs in the Hot 100\\'s top 10 this week, including one that completes a much shorter trip to the tier than Carey\\'s …  Sheeran and Beyoncé\\'s \"Perfect\" (on Atlantic Records) tops the Hot 100 for a second week. First released as a solo song by Sheeran on his album ÷ (Divide), which debuted atop the Billboard 200 dated March 25, the new duet version was released Nov. 30. In its second full tracking week, it sold 98,000 downloads (down 46 percent), as it spends a third week at No. 1 on the Digital Song Sales chart.  \"Perfect\" pushes 3-2 on Radio Songs (117 million in audience, up 13 percent, good for the Hot 100\\'s top gain in airplay) and bullets at No. 3 on Streaming Songs (39.7 million U.S. streams, up 14 percent).  The rest of the Hot 100\\'s top five likewise remains in place, with Post Malone\\'s \"Rockstar,\" featuring 21 Savage, at No. 2 for a second week after eight weeks at No. 1. It tops Streaming Songs for a 12th week (43.9 million, down 12 percent) and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts for a 10th week each.  Camila Cabello\\'s \"Havana,\" featuring Young Thug, holds at No. 3 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2, and tops Radio Songs for a second frame (132 million, up 5 percent); Lil Pump\\'s \"Gucci Gang\" keeps at No. 4 after hitting No. 3; and Imagine Dragons\\' \"Thunder\" is steady at No. 5 after climbing to No. 4, while leading Hot Rock Songs for a seventh week.  Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B\\'s \"MotorSport\" wheels 15-6 on the Hot 100 for its first week in the top 10, following the Dec. 7 arrival of its official video. The track charges 9-5 on Streaming Songs (31.7 million, up 40 percent) and 43-25 on Digital Song Sales (15,000, up 44 percent), as it posts the Hot 100\\'s top gains in streaming and sales, and rises 37-34 on Radio Songs (35 million, up 10 percent).  Migos earn their second Hot 100 top 10, following \"Bad and Boujee\" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert), which led for three weeks beginning Jan. 21; Minaj tallies her 15th Hot 100 top 10, extending her record for the most among female rappers; and Cardi B becomes the first female rapper to send her first three Hot 100 entries to the top 10, following her own \"Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),\" which spent three weeks at No. 1 in October, and G-Eazy\\'s \"No Limit,\" on which she\\'s featured with A$AP Rocky. The latter track dips to No. 10 from its No. 7 high.  Above Carey\\'s \"Christmas\" and G-Eazy\\'s \"Limit,\" Sam Smith\\'s No. 4-peaking \"Too Good at Goodbyes\" slips 6-7 and Halsey\\'s \"Bad at Love\" holds at its No. 8 Hot 100 peak to date.

       " 'Let Zayn entertain you! The singer gets frisky with a stripper in his new video for ‘Entertainer!’ Watch here!  Zayn Mailk and model Sofia Jamora are at it again in his latest music video for “Entertainer.” In it, Sofia is seen rocking a blonde wig, which gives her more Kylie Jenner vibes than Gigi Hadid, but she’s in the dressing room of a strip club while Zayn walks the streets smoking a cig. The vid is a continuation of his last hit, “Let Me,” in which Zayn is essentially in Scarface and he and Sofia escape the bad guys on a boat. This time, Zayn enters the club and sees his love interest, while singing, “Guess you didn’t know that you were my favorite entertainer, I watch you, laugh with and f–k with you. Don’t you take me for a fool. In this game, I own the rules.” Damn.  As a bleach blonde Zayn spots Sofia, he has flashbacks to their “Let Me” rendezvous. Once Sofia starts dancing on him, he recalls their hotel hook up and we’re not gonna lie, it’s super hot. Sofia the stripper keeps looking up at a camera, recording she and Zayn in the club, and tell him she’ll BRB. Except Zayn flashes back again to Sofia leaving him in the hotel room and disappearing without a trace. She does it again, this time in the club, and leaves a hopeless Zayn alone once more. He sees her take off in a black car and watches her go.  The final scene shows Zayn standing alone on a dock with a suitcase, clearly ready for his next adventure. This time, there is no “To be continued…” We can’t help but wonder, was this a message to Gigi after she broke up with him? “Thought that you were smarter, I’m ashamed for you.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, expecting their third child within weeks, broke usual protocol by arriving after the Queen at the Easter Mattins Service at St George's Chapel in Windsor.  The couple eschewed the downhill walk and took a royal car to the entrance, arriving several minutes after the Queen, who also arrived by car and was travelling without the Duke of Edinburgh, 96, who did not attend the service.  Although Meghan and Harry also chose not to appear at the chapel where they'll tie the knot next month; the Queen, dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall all also in attendance for the seasonal service.  Arriving without husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace, Zara did take the short downhill walk, showing off her blossoming bump in a blue bespoke Séraphine coat and hat by Jane Taylor as she chatted with Princess Beatrice, her sister Eugenie and husband-to-be Jack Brooksbank at the chapel's entrance.

       " \"Stormi has stopped the world from turning, and here's what the name actually means.  Kylie Jenner has officially announced the name of her daughter as Stormi, and the internet can’t get enough.  From references to the weather (“There’s expected to be Stormi weather and Reign over Chicago this weekend,” read one tweet) and questions over any hidden meanings (a link to butterflies, perhaps?), fans are pouring over the name for every possible meaning.  Here, we’ve rounded up five things to know about the name Stormi—because we know you want to know everything, naturally.  The name Stormi (as you may have guessed) has an Old English origin and stems from the word ‘Storm’—describing temperament or a weather pattern. It’s often associated with moody and mysterious characters. The name peaked in popularity in the early 1990s, with data on Think Baby Names showing an increase in popularity for the name around 1992, before dropping off closer to the millennium. No doubt baby Stormi will revisit the public conscious now that it’s got the Jenner stamp of approval. There are a number of famous celebrities called Stormi, including Stormi Bree Henley, an American model and partner of Lucky Blue Smith, but most are spelt Stormy (with the y). A number of references to storms can be seen throughout music history, including Stormy Monday by TB Walker and Stormy, by Classics IV. Although none mention any Kardashian/Jenner babies, we’ve got no doubt Travis Scott will be dropping a song (or two) about stormy weather very soon. Baby Stormi’s full name isn’t yet confirmed, but as Travis Scott’s real name is actually Jacques Webster, fans are deciding she will be named Stormi Webster. Others are saying Stormi is just it—no last name—and others are saying Jenner will hyphenate for what might be the most famous double-barreled name of the 2020s.  A fan of the name of not, there’s no doubt Kylie Jenner gets us all talking.\",\n",

       " 'Queen Elizabeth II didn\\'t blast Meghan Markle for exhibiting \"diva behavior\"  According to Gossip Cop, there is no truth to reports claiming that the Queen \"blasted\" the Duchess of Sussex for acting like a diva. In fact, the two have a great relationship.  \"She has developed an increasingly close, warm relationship with [both] the queen and her father-in-law, Prince Charles,\" the insider said. \"She wants to please them and is doing whatever she can to educate herself to make sure she doesn\\'t put a foot wrong.\"  This news comes after the National Enquirer reported that the \"British monarchy is open to modernizing.\" However, Markle\\'s \"tacky Hollywood-princess style is not what the royal family had in mind.\"  The tabloid alleged that Markle\\'s diva behavior has gotten under everyone\\'s skin. The unidentified source said that the Queen has \"told Prince Harry to give his bossy bride a \\'shape up or else\\' ultimatum because she\\'s wrecked his credibility.\"  The insider added that the Queen called Markle to her chambers and reprimanded her about her fashion. Queen Elizabeth reportedly told the new duchess to dress down because she\\'s not starring in a reality TV show but is representing the world\\'s most prestigious family.  The Queen wants Markle to \"change her ways immediately.\" Due to the said incidents, the Duchess of Sussex reportedly earned the nickname \"Meghan the Menace.\"  Sally Osman, the director of royal communication was reportedly the first casualty of Markle\\'s diva behavior. But Gossip Cop said that it was not true. The former \"Suits\" star moved to London last year, but it was only a week ago that Osman and another palace aide resigned. Also, Osman was not fired, she resigned  Despite the report, the Queen and the Duchess of Sussex get along very well. In fact, the monarch has given Markle privileges that Kate Middleton didn\\'t receive. For instance, Her Majesty invited Markle to visit Cheshire using her personal train. Only the senior royals have used the said transportation. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry haven\\'t used it.  Also, Queen Elizabeth II invited the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to the Queen\\'s Young Leaders Awards ceremony. A number of royals were invited to the event since it started in 2014, but Middleton had never been to it.  Photo: Getty Images/Jeff J Mitchell',\n",

       " 'We’ve come a long way from Patricia Arquette’s 2015 Oscars speech to now. Since that watershed moment — when Arquette addressed the wage gap on live TV, in front of the entire industry — actors and actresses have continued to speak out about pay inequality in Hollywood and around the country, to draw attention to the pay gaps that affect women everywhere. Their conversations expand to include discussions on race in the negotiating room, including men in salary conversations, and hard-won advice on how to ask for a raise.  2015: The Year of the Sony Hack and Patricia Arquette’s Milestone Speech      Actress Patricia Arquette accepts the award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for ‘Boyhood’ onstage during the 87th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on February 22, 2015 in Hollywood, California.  Patricia Arquette, February 2015: “It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all.”  After stepping onstage to receive the Best Supporting Actress award for her role in Boyhood, Arquette’s three-minute speech permanently shifted pay inequality into the media’s limelight, invigorating female actresses to speak up on the issue over the course of the year.  “To every woman who gave birth to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else’s equal rights,” Arquette said in her speech. “It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America.”  The subsequent outpouring of criticism and support alike prompted Arquette to publish an op-ed in The Hollywood Reporter at the end of the year, titled “What Happened After My Oscar Speech on Pay Inequality,” in which she detailed her mistakes in the speech, such as not distinguishing women of color in the discussion, and outlined her hopes for the future.  Kerry Washington, April 2015, The #Ask4More Campaign: “When we step up for ourselves, we create opportunity.”  In honor of Equal Pay Day, Washington tweeted an image of herself with the caption “Equal pay for Equal Work” and Levo’s #Ask4more campaign, an initiative that encourages women to request higher salaries and end the gender wage gap.  Judy Greer, May 2015: “I am terrified to be deemed ‘difficult.’”  Emboldened by Arquette’s Oscars speech and the ensuing media attention on the wage gap in Hollywood, Greer published her own op-ed in Glamour, motivating other women in the industry to speak up.  “I was raised to never talk about money, so I never ask for more. I am terrified to be deemed ‘difficult,’ and I don’t think I’m the only woman with that fear. I may not be able to single-handedly fix the pay gap, but I can open my stepdaughter’s eyes to it. I can encourage her to negotiate, ask questions, and stand up for herself. I can remind myself to try that too.”  Nicki Minaj, May 2015: “Do your research.”  In an intimate interview with Cosmo, the rapper discussed all things sex, power, and, of course, money, stressing how she’s never held back in any category. “Women are uncomfortable talking about money. I know it’s taboo to discuss it at work. But you need to know what people around you are making. Otherwise, you’re not going to know what you’re worth. You have to ask questions. Do your research. I’ve always been pretty competitive in terms of my pay.”  Frances McDormand, winner of the Best Actress award for ‘Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri’ poses during the 90th Annual Academy Awards on March 4, 2018 in Hollywood, California.  Frances McDormand, May 2015: “We’ve never been paid commensurately.”  Well before her “inclusion rider” speech, McDormand delivered honest and blunt jabs at the industry’s treatment of some of its highest-paid actresses, who McDormand claimed still probably only get paid a fraction of what their male equivalents do. She went on to discuss her salary for her role in Transformers 3. “I’m glad I did that film and I’m proud that I finally got paid what I was told I was worth by the industry,” she said at the Cannes Film Festival’s Women in Motion panel. “But that is nothing. That is a tenth of what most males my age, with my experience and my reputation as a film actor, make. We’ve never been paid commensurately and that has to change.”  Charlize Theron, May 2015: “They did not fight it.”  Earlier in the year, Theron had successfully negotiated a pay raise to match that of co-star Chris Hemsworth in the upcoming sequel for Snow White and the Huntsman. “I have to give them credit because once I asked, they said yes,” she told Elle U.K. in a cover story. “They did not fight it. And maybe that’s the message: that we just need to put our foot down. If you’re doing the same job, you should be compensated and treated in the same way.”  Amanda Seyfried, July 2015: He was “pretty even in status.”  Following in Jennifer Lawrence’s and Charlize Theron’s footsteps, Seyfried told the Sunday Times about the wage discrepancy on the set of one of her films, where a male co-star whom she described as “pretty even in status” with her was making exactly ten times more than she was.  “I think people think that just because I’m easygoing and game to do things I’ll just take as little as they offer,” she said. “It’s not about how much you get; it’s about how fair it is.”  Nominee for Best Supporting Actress in ‘American Hustle’ Jennifer Lawrence poses on the red carpet at the 86th Academy Awards on March 2nd, 2014 in Hollywood, California.  Jennifer Lawrence, October 2015: The Lenny Letter  In November 2014, the Sony hack leaks made international news as confidential emails, company secrets, and, yes, individual salaries were publicly disclosed. Lawrence, alongside Amy Adams and Natalie Portman, was among those who discovered their pay had been significantly lower than their male counterparts’ in Oscar-nominated films. This prompted Lawrence to write an essay in Lena Dunham’s Lenny Letter on the wage disparity, titled “Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-stars?” Lawrence drew praise and criticism alike for her willingness to speak out.  “I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled,’” she wrote. “At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn’t worry about being ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’”  Bradley Cooper, October 2015: “There’s a double standard.”  As Lawrence’s recurring co-star and longtime friend, Bradley Cooper gave Entertainment Tonight an interview the same day J.Law’s Lenny Letter was published, rallying in her support. “There’s a double standard in the whole world. This is just one aspect. Anytime there’s a place where a voice can come out and be outspoken — something Sienna (Miller) did, or Jennifer (Lawrence) — that’s great. … I think it is making a difference.”  Salma Hayek, October 2015: “This is a problem that is in every single industry.”  An honoree at Variety’s Power of Women luncheon alongside Beyoncé and Gucci, for her work with the Chime for Change women’s empowerment project, Hayek gave an emotional, rousing speech on the sexism women faced in the industry, praising Patricia Arquette’s Oscars speech for addressing pay disparity in Hollywood.  “This is a problem that is in every single industry. If you have the same capacities and you are doing the same job, it is criminal not to pay the same salary. We are such an economical power, women in the country. We represent such a strong part of the audience that they cannot ignore us anymore.”  Gwyneth Paltrow, October 2015: “Your salary is a way to quantify what you’re worth.”  When it came to being honest about her thoughts on male co-star Robert Downey Jr.’s paycheck for Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow didn’t hold back during an interview with Variety. “Look, nobody is worth the money that Robert Downey Jr. is worth, but if I told you the disparity you would probably be surprised,” she said. “Your salary is a way to quantify what you’re worth. If men are being paid a lot more for doing the same thing, it feels shitty.”  Sharon Stone, November 2015: “No one wanted to pay me.”  Her performance in 1992’s Basic Instinct made her a household name, but Stone didn’t reap many of the financial benefits that can come with fame. At the Celebration of Hope event during Miami Fashion Week, she gave a speech to the audience. “No one wanted to pay me. I remember sitting in my kitchen with my manager and just crying and saying: ‘I’m not going to work until I get paid.’ I still got paid so much less than any men.”  Sandra Bullock, November 2015: “Why is it that no one is standing up and saying you can’t say that about a woman?”  For Variety’s cover story on income disparity, Bullock depicted the wage-gap issue as part of the holistic and fundamentally flawed way women in Hollywood are perceived. “I keep saying, “Why is it that no one is standing up and saying you can’t say that about a woman?” … We’re going to walk down the red carpet, I’m going to be asked about my dress and my hair while the man standing next to me will be asked about his performance and political issues. Once we start shifting how we perceive women and stop thinking about them as ‘less than,’ the pay disparity will take care of itself.”  Carey Mulligan, November 2015: “She has an enormous platform.”  The actress defended Jennifer Lawrence’s outspoken stance and advocacy for equal pay within the industry after the Sony-hack leaks, telling Deadline: “The discrepancy is inherently unfair and she has an enormous platform to speak out against it. Men in Hollywood look up to her because she is powerful. She’s using that platform to correct something that isn’t right. It’s a long-overdue conversation and it’s admirable what she has done.”  Kathy Griffin, November 2015: “It was an all-out brawl.”  Griffin is a veteran in the art of negotiating salaries, but that doesn’t mean her feats came easily. During her breakout role in NBC’s 1996 Suddenly Susan, Griffin discovered she made nearly four times less than a male co-star. After her own agents repeatedly dismissed her, she went directly to Warner Bros. TV chief Peter Roth and demanded a raise. “It was an all-out brawl,” she told Variety. “I got a raise, but I still didn’t make equal to what the guys were making.”  Ten years later, an Emmy-winning Griffin had twice the confidence to ask NBC co-chairman Ben Silverman for a pay hike for her part on the Bravo reality series My Life on the D-List. “I’ve been doing this shit on my own forever,” she said in the Variety interview. “I’ve never been paid what the guys get. Ever. It’s not getting better for me.”  Toni Colette, November 2015: “Money is genderless.”  On HuffPost Live, joined by actresses Jennifer Lawrence, Jessica Chastain, and Amanda Seyfried, Toni Colette didn’t hold back when commenting on the wage disparity in Hollywood. “It’s a fucking sexist industry. I don’t understand why genitalia makes a difference. Creativity is creativity. Creativity is genderless. Money is genderless.”  Cate Blanchett, December 2015: “The industry has the same conversation every year.”  Following her Oscars acceptance speech for her role in Blue Jasmine, Blanchett became a figurehead for the feminist movement in Hollywood that aimed to put women in leading cinematographic roles. When asked about pay equality, however, Blanchett believed there was all talk and no walk. “It just feels like the industry has the same conversation every year, it’s a fabulous conversation, but we’ll be back here like Groundhog Day next year having the same fucking symposium,” she told GQ. “It just has to shift.”  Election Year 2016: A Hamilton Rap, Race in the Negotiating Room, and the House of Cards Controversy  Chris Rock, January 2016: “If she was black, she’d really have something to complain about.”  Speaking to The New Yorker about Leslie Jones’s road to success, Chris Rock, who met Jones in the late ’80s when the two were comics on the road, reintroduced the racial dynamics of pay equality for women. “Black women have the hardest gig in show business. You hear Jennifer Lawrence complaining about getting paid less because she’s a woman — if she was black, she’d really have something to complain about.”  Viola Davis attends PaleyLive NY: ‘How To Get Away With Murder’ at The Paley Center for Media on November 12, 2015 in New York City.  Viola Davis, February 2016: “The struggle for us as women of color is just to be seen the same as our white female counterparts.”  In a Q&A with Mashable, Davis broached the equal-pay subject through the lens of African-American women. Stressing the different playing fields between white and black women, Davis emphasized the additional hurdles that women of color face regarding the wage gap.  “The struggle for us as women of color is just to be seen the same as our white female counterparts. Forget the men! We’re not even in that realm yet. It’s like talking to someone who lives in poverty! ‘You don’t want that Bentley?’ They’re like ‘Shoot, I’m just trying to get bus fare money.’”  Lin Manuel-Miranda, March 2016: “Yo, it’s Lin.”  The Hamilton writer, director, producer, and actor rapped while actress and ambassador to the U.N. Emma Watson beatboxed in a promotional video for the HeForShe Campaign founded by U.N. women, filmed around International Women’s Day of that year.  “Yo, it’s Lin and I have to laugh, how can we not be equal, we’re like half. Like women are half of the people on Earth. And yes they should’ve been equal since birth. That means all day, every day, equal pay, every way.”  Robin Wright, May 2016: “I was like, ‘You better pay me or I’m going to go public.’”  Taking a page from Claire Underwood’s handbook, Robin Wright told Netflix she’d go public if they did not pay her as much as co-star Kevin Spacey for her role in House of Cards. “There are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal,” she said in a human rights discussion at the Rockefeller Foundation. “And they are in House of Cards. Claire Underwood’s character was more popular than [Frank’s] for a period of time, so I capitalized on it. I was like, ‘You better pay me or I’m going to go public.’ And they did.’”  Amy Adams, November 2016: “I don’t want to be a headline anymore.”  During one of The Hollywood Reporter’s recurring roundtable series, actresses Amy Adams, Taraji P. Henson, Natalie Portman, Emma Stone, Annette Bening, Naomie Harris, and Isabelle Huppert discussed a number of topics regarding women in the entertainment industry. When asked about equal pay, Adams sought to redirect the question.  “We are always put on the chopping block to put our opinion out there. I’m like, “Why don’t you ask [the producers] and then have their statements be the headlines in the press? I don’t want to be a headline anymore about pay equality.”  William H. Macy with Emmy Rossum, December 2016: “It’s unconscionable.”  When Emmy Rossum joined the cast of Shameless in 2011, she had no intentions of being paid as much as the veteran, Oscar-nominated actor William H. Macy. However, as the show’s popularity grew exponentially, so did Rossum’s presence and importance to the plot line, prompting her to ask for equal pay. Both Rossum and Macy spoke about the subject at a panel at the Vulture Festival. “As the time went on, the leadership role started to feel somewhat shared,” Rossum said. “I just felt that I love the show, I love everyone in it, I want to keep doing it, but I just wanted it to feel right.”  Macy wholeheartedly supported and agreed with Rossum’s sentiments, giving his own opinion on the matter. “It’s unconscionable they would pay a woman less for the same job,” Macy said at the panel. “It’s show biz’s job to get us for as cheaply as they can — and our job to say no.” That same month, it was confirmed Rossum would receive equal pay going forward.  2017: Oprah Winfrey’s Power Move, Emma Stone on Men, and E!’s Wage Gap Scandal  Natalie Portman, January 2017: “I knew and I went along with it.”  In an interview for Marie Claire’s cover, Portman revealed she was paid three times less than her male co-star, Ashton Kutcher, for the hit rom-com No Strings Attached. “I knew and I went along with it because there’s this thing with ‘quotes’ in Hollywood… His [quote] was three times higher than mine so they said he should get three times more. I wasn’t as pissed as I should have been. The disparity is crazy.”  Priyanka Chopra, May 2017: “I’m still used to being paid a lot less than the boys.”  The actress got her big break as the lead in the hit series Quantico, and was to star in the highly anticipated reboot of Baywatch, when she told Glamour about her refusal to be typecast as the exotic Indian female character, and the struggles that came with being a woman in the male-dominated industry.  “I was told that female actors are replaceable in films because they just stand behind a guy anyway. I’m still used to being paid — like most actresses around the world — a lot less than the boys. We’re told we’re too provocative or that being sexy is our strength, which it can be, and it is, but that’s not the only thing we have.”  Emma Stone, July 2017: “I’ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut.”  Stone spoke to Out magazine about her portrayal of Billie Jean King in Battle of the Sexes, a film about the most-watched televised sporting event of all time, between King and Bobby Riggs. In the film, King struggles with her own sexuality as her husband urges her to fight for equal pay. Stone reflected on the ongoing realities of the situation in her personal career, and as an actress in Hollywood at large.  “I’ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them. And that’s something they do for me because they feel it’s what’s right and fair. That’s something that’s also not discussed, necessarily — that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly say, ‘That’s what’s fair.’”  Oprah Winfrey attends the European Premiere of ‘A Wrinkle In Time’ at BFI IMAX on March 13, 2018 in London, England  Oprah Winfrey, August 2017: “I will not work unless they get paid.”  In an interview with Time magazine, Oprah revealed the barriers she faced when trying to get her female producers on The Oprah Winfrey Show higher salaries to match the show’s growing success. “I went to my boss at the time and I said ‘Everybody needs a raise,’ And he said, ‘Why?’ He actually said to me, ‘They’re only girls. They’re a bunch of girls — what do they need more money for?’ I go, ‘Well, either they’re going to get raises, or I’m going to sit down.’ I will not work unless they get paid.’”  Winfrey’s determination forced the owners to increase here female colleagues’ salaries. She paid them out of her own pocket while waiting for her request to be processed and finalized.  Catt Sadler, December 2017, E!’s wage gap scandal: “How can I remain silent?”  Following the discovery that her E! co-host Jason Kennedy had been making nearly twice her salary despite similar work histories, Catt Sadler attempted to negotiate a raise that more closely resembled Kennedy’s yearly wage. After her team’s requests were repeatedly denied, Sadler decided to leave the network, releasing a statement on her personal website to explain her decision.  “Know your worth. How can I operate with integrity and stay on at E if they’re not willing to pay me the same as him? Or at least come close? How can I accept an offer that shows they do not value my contributions and paralleled dedication all these years? How can I not echo the actions of my heroes and stand for what is right no matter what the cost? How can I remain silent when my rights under the law have been violated?”  2018: The Harvey Weinstein Reckoning, #MeToo, and Time’s Up  (L-R) Reese Witherspoon, Eva Longoria, Salma Hayek and Ashley Judd arrives at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.  The 2018 Golden Globes: Time’s Up Stands With Catt Sadler  Given the then-recent blow to E!’s reputation following Catt Sadler’s departure, many celebrities weren’t thrilled to have it aired at the 2018 Golden Globes, particularly people dedicated to the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements, with all attendees dressed in black as a sign of respect and of dissent against the industry’s long-prevailing sexist standards. As a result, many female actresses took to social media or, while speaking with an E! host on the red carpet, called out the network in a show of support for Sadler and the equal pay movement. Here are the women who spoke on camera:  Amy Schumer on Instagram: “If you’re on the carpet tonight or at home post in support and ask @eentertainment what happened? We thought you would be for pay equality and say #imwithcattsad.”  Eva Longoria to E! News’ Ryan Seacrest, standing between Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon: “We’re here for Time’s Up, we support gender equity and equal pay, and we hope that E! follows that lead with Catt as well. We stand with you, Catt.”  Debra Messing to E! News’ Giuliana Ransic: “I was so shocked to hear that E! doesn’t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.”  Laura Dern to Seacrest: “We need the powers that be, and all the industries, and all the networks, and E!, to help us with closing this pay gender gap.”  Sarah Jessica Parker to Seacrest: “Equality, parity, and safe work environments for men and women across all industries are key; I know it’s affected your network.”  Michelle Williams, January 2018, All the Money in the World Controversy: “Today isn’t about me.”  Williams learned she made less than one percent of what her co-star Mark Wahlberg made for All the Money in the World’s reshoots, following Kevin Spacey’s dismissal amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations. Wahlberg earned $1.5 million for the scenes collectively, while she received $80 per day, resulting in about $1,000 total. Williams was overcome with support by the community of women rallying around Time’s Up. Wahlberg announced he would donate his $1.5 million to the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, and Williams made a statement of her own.  “Today isn’t about me, my fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted,” she said.  Ellen Pompeo, January 2018: “I’m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.”  Opening up about her fight for equal pay behind the scenes of Grey’s Anatomy, Pompeo told The Hollywood Reporter about the importance of power leverage and ultimatums when it comes to negotiating. “At one point, I asked for $5,000 more than [Patrick Dempsey] just on principle, because the show is Grey’s Anatomy and I’m Meredith Grey. They wouldn’t give it to me. And I could have walked away, so why didn’t I? You feel conflicted but then you figure, ‘I’m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.’”  After 14 seasons, she signed a deal in late 2017 that made her the highest-paid actress on a television drama, with a paycheck of $575,000 per episode. “Decide what you think you’re worth and then ask for what you think you’re worth,” she said. “Nobody’s just going to give it to you.”  Actors Octavia Spencer (L) and Jessica Chastain attend The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.  Octavia Spencer with Jessica Chastain and Jada Pinkett-Smith, January 2018: “We gotta bring women of color to the table.”  Octavia Spencer reintroduced intersectionality to the wage-gap conversation, an element that several black female actresses have stressed as crucial to the discussion in the past. At the Sundance Film Festival’s Women Breaking Barriers panel, Spencer recalled a personal conversation with her friend and future co-star in an unnamed film, Jessica Chastain, in which she highlighted the struggles that African-American women face in the context of equal pay. “I said, ‘Here’s the thing, women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women,’” Spencer told the Hollywood Foreign Press at the panel. “So, if we’re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.” Spencer got emotional when she recounted that Chastain, who went quiet at her unawareness of this second disparity, decided to take action and get Spencer five times her salary.  Jada Pinkett-Smith, who will co-star alongside both women in a holiday comedy currently in production, sang Chastain’s praises for raising her and Spencer’s wages. “It’s nice to go out and march, we can do that. It’s nice to wear black at the Golden Globes,” she said. “But what are we doing behind closed doors? And I got to give our sister Jessica Chastain her props.”  Jessica Chastain, a longtime outspoken advocate for gender equality and taking on strong female roles (in Zero Dark Thirty, Miss Sloane, and most recently, Molly’s Game) said in an interview with Variety a year earlier, “I’m not taking jobs anymore where I’m getting paid a quarter of what the male co-star is being paid. I’m not allowing that in my life.”  Emily Blunt, February 2018: “‘Making an aggressive deal’ [is] a positive.”  In Vanity Fair’s cover story, Blunt revealed her assertive approach to negotiating her salary for any role, by virtue of the growing pressure and public relations risks faced by current-day producers. “Especially in this new climate, I think that it’s O.K. to reclaim the words ‘making an aggressive deal’ as a positive. Usually people are making so much money off your back that it comes down to a sort of justice thing for me. I make it a point to not be too concerned with ‘I hope they think I’m a team player.’”  Sienna Miller, March 2018: Turning down a role was “difficult and lonely.”  In an interview with The Guardian at the UN Annual Meeting on Gender Equality, the actress shared her story of having to turn down a powerful Broadway role because she was offered less than half of what the male co-star would receive. “The decision to turn down this particular role was difficult and lonely,” she said. “I was forced to choose between making a concession on my self-worth and dignity and a role that I was in love with.”  Claire Foy, March 2018: “I’m not surprised.”  The queen of The Crown made international headlines as one of the show’s producers accidentally revealed that Foy, the main protagonist of the series, was paid less than her male co-star Matt Smith, who plays Prince Phillip in a supporting role. “I’m not [surprised about the interest in the story] in the sense that it was a female-led drama,” Foy told Entertainment Weekly. “I’m not surprised that people saw [the story] and went, ‘Oh, that’s a bit odd.’”  Alicia Keys, April 2018: “We have to infiltrate our industries. Period.”  In Variety’s annual Power of Women NY issue, Alicia Keys spoke about the no-makeup movement she inspired and gender parity. “Until we’re in those rooms as equally as men are, it can’t shift. We have to infiltrate our industries. Period. We have to. That alone will shift the power balance.”  Read the Cut’s guides to how to ask for a raise and what to do when a male co-worker is making more than you.',\n",

       " 'Taylor Swift\\'s Reputation has just surpassed two million sales, making it the first album to do so since Adele\\'s 25 in 2015.  Currently in its 18th week of release, it\\'s also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran\\'s ÷ being the other, according to Nielsen tracking figures. Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.  All of Swift\\'s six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.  However, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift\\'s past three albums combined.  2014\\'s 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012\\'s Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010\\'s Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008\\'s Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.  Swift’s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May.

       " 'The actress talked about the confusion on \\'Jimmy Kimmel Live!\\'  When visiting Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday, Isla Fisher talked about how fans constantly confuse her with actress Amy Adams. Fisher admitted that she usually tries to correct people, but that she sometimes goes along with the assumption.  For instance, she almost got caught in a lie at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. \"The crowd parted and there was Lady Gaga and she’s heading right toward me and she says, ‘Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy….’” The actress is a big fan of the singer and didn’t want to tell her the truth, so she went along with her presumed identity as Amy Adams. “So I just gracefully thanked her and bowed my head.” As she continued to fall deeper into the lie, her true identity was almost exposed. “I look over her shoulder and there’s Amy Adams walking into the party.” She quickly created a diversion by pointing to Adams and saying, “There’s Isla Fisher. She’s not even nominated for anything. What’s she doing here?”  The actress also recalled a time when a mother and her children spotted Fisher at IKEA and requested that she sing “That’s How You Know,” a song Adams performs in Enchanted. “I’m tone-deaf,” Fisher prefaced before singing a few lines from the song to Kimmel. After hearing Fisher’s rendition, the woman “backed away realizing that I was clearly not Amy Adams.”  In order to avoid any more confusion, Fisher brought a PSA to explain the differences between the two actresses. “I feel as though I should, this evening, set the record straight,” she said while introducing the clip.  The PSA opens with Fisher standing in front of a white backdrop with a piano playing in the background. “Hello. I’m Isla Fisher and I’d like to clear something up,” she began. “I am not Amy Adams. Amy Adams and I are completely different people.”  Fisher first explained that she and Amy Adams have different hair colors. “Amy Adams has auburn red [hair]. My hair is light auburn red,” she said. She then pointed out that they have had different roles. “Amy Adams played Susan in Nocturnal Animals. I played Laura in Nocturnal Animals.”  The actress also explained that they have different accomplishments. “Amy Adams has five Oscar nominations,” she said. “I am a member of SAG.”  And Fisher joked that she and Adams might also be confused for another redheaded actress. “Amy Adams played Maya in Zero Dark Thirty. Oh wait, no. That was Jessica Chastain,” she said. “OK, maybe it’s a little hard to tell us apart,” Fisher admitted. “But the point is when you come up to any of us and say ‘I love you in Arrival,’ it hurts because we weren’t in Arrival.”  Fisher concluded the PSA by stating, “We have totally different names, hence we are totally different people.” She also wanted to remind everyone that she’s “not Wendy from the hamburger commercials.”',\n",
       " 'Marvel’s Runaways are finally living up to their name.  The Hulu superhero series, from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), returns for its second season on Dec. 21 and EW has an exclusive look at the new trailer above.  At the end of season 1, the titular band of teens, after discovering their parents are supervillains, finally ran away from home. “This year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war,” says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. “It’s in Griffith Park,” Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. “It was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the ’60s or ’70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.” Adds Schwartz, “We wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.” Teenagers really need a place to hang out…even if it’s an underground dust-filled mansion.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  In the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly’s (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). “He is a character who’s from the comics,” Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. “He’s not all that he appears to be.” Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. “It’s the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,” says Schwartz. “When [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.” We’re pretty sure it wasn’t the dust.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  The Hostel even blesses the group with some new accessories thanks to an antiquated but full closet. “There’s the perfect wide-legged 1970s jeans for Karolina (Virginia Gardner) and the perfect leather jacket for Gert (Ariela Barer) and an adorable tiny tuxedo jacket for Nico (Lyrica Okanu),” says Savage. “So everything you’d want from every era is hiding in that closet.” No one wants to be dressed in sweats when you’re saving the world.  Marvel’s Runaways returns Dec. 21 on Hulu.  Related content:',\n",
       " \"After escaping her reportedly intense marriage to mega-star Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes was probably looking for a sense of calm and stability in her next serious relationship.  But it’s questionable whether the “Dawson’s Creek” alum has found that with Jamie Foxx, with multiple reports suggesting that the Oscar-winning actor hasn’t been able to let go of his flirtatious, bachelor ways.  “No one understands why Katie loves a man who can’t seem to commit or why he’s publicly humiliating her like this,” an insider told Us magazine. “Everyone just wants her to take care of herself and to be happy. But she won’t let go of Jamie.”  Foxx, 50, sparked breakup rumors earlier this month when he was spotted partying in Miami with multiple women, while Holmes, 39, was in Paris for Fashion Week. Foxx also was seen getting close to his ex-girlfriend Kristin Grannis on July 4 when they watched fireworks together in Malibu. On top of that, the “Ray” actor was hit with allegations that he got rough with a woman during a sexual encounter in Las Vegas 2002 and tried to force her to have oral sex with him.  While TMZ reported that Foxx won’t face charges in that case because the statute of limitations had run out, Holmes is reportedly unhappy with his other behavior around women, Us magazine reported.  Nonetheless, Holmes is not ready to give up on the relationship, because she’s “absolutely smitten” with him, the insider told Us.  Page Six reported that Holmes was heard declaring her love for the “Django Unchained” actor after she boarded a flight to Paris. Suri, her 12-year-old daughter with Cruise, was with her, as was a friend and their nanny.  “Katie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,” a source told Page Six. “She said she loves him and asked if he wanted ‘cookies from Paris.'”  Holmes and Foxx reportedly began dating in 2013 after Holmes divorced Cruise in 2012, but Holmes and Foxx went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret. That’s because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  They still have never publicly confirmed that they are a couple, though they did the next best thing in September 2017 by being photographed together, walking on a beach in Malibu holding hands.  Then again, when RadarOnline reported in late June that the couple had split, Holmes representative went on the record to call the story “100 percent untrue.” Many outlets took the on-the-record denial as an official confirmation that there is — or was — a relationship.  Us magazine said there are other challenges to the relationship, notably the fact that Holmes lives in New York City and Foxx is based in Los Angeles. But they see each other “more than people would think,” a source said.  The key to Foxx’s hold on Holmes is that he’s “mesmerizing,” “entertaining” and can always make her laugh, the source told Us. So, somehow it works for her — for now.  “She has fun with him when they are together,” the source said. “It’s a relationship that works for her.”\",\n",

National Enquirer is the first to claim that the Oscar-winning actor \"has been dragged into an FBI probe, after gifting stunned dinner party guests with $1 MILLION in cash stuffed in a designer bag!\"  The publication claims that there\\'s a \"hush-hush government investigation\" surrounding the \"Money Monster\" actor and \"the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it.\" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his \"generous nature,\" had a \"desire to spread the wealth.\" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, \"Being the practical joker he is, George would\\'ve known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would\\'ve caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.\"  \"There is a protocol, and the FBI would\\'ve been called in to question the depositor,\" the insider continued, before adding, \"But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag.\" The insider asserts, \"This is the last thing that George needs right now. He\\'s got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!\"  However, Gossip Cop has debunked all of the above allegations. The site can confirm that there\\'s no real probe or scandal, and Clooney has not attracted any \"federal attention.\" A representative for the \"Ocean\\'s Eleven\" star tells the site that the story made by National Enquirer \"is fabricated.\"',\n",

       " \"During Kanye West’s 11-month absence from the site, Twitter could hardly have been described as boring. Even without the 40-year-old rapper’s daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting “emotional over fonts”, declared The Life of Pablo “the album of the life” and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane.  The rise and rise of Kanye West’s influence on fashion Read more  Having deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. “Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,” he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word “Saint”, West’s son’s name, in various typefaces.  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends  Following a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: “As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,” read one tweet. “Try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,” he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called “extremely good advice”. West went on to call distraction “the enemy of vision” and instructed his 7.6 million followers to “make decisions based on love not fear”.  All these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation.  “I’ve got this new concept that I’ve been diggin’ into,” he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. “I’ve got a concept about photographs, and I’m on the fence about photographs – about human beings being obsessed with photographs – because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.” Time, West added, “is our most valuable resource”.  To his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner’s return to Twitter. He’s always been hip-hop’s pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West’s latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. “Oh by the way this is my book that I’m writing in real time,” West wrote. “No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.”  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.  Of course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West’s plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016’s The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York’s Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called “Turbo Grafx 16”, a title that’s presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo.  In March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where “he is in the zone to get things done”. Rumored visitors of West’s, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.  Nevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he’s also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West’s insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas.\",\n",

       " 'Blake told the crowd during a performance in Oklahoma that Gwen had given birth to twins.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Charley Gallay / Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine’s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you! Blake.”',\n",

       " 'On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what’s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here’s all the gossip leading up to the year’s most anticipated nuptials:  What’s up with Meghan’s dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan’s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they’ve reportedly spoken by phone. An “insider” recently told People magazine, “Like any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.”  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan’s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it “the biggest mistake in wedding history.” The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan’s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were “stupid and hammy,” and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.”  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: “Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.”  And what’s up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.’s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry’s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.” (The two reportedly haven’t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a “shallow social climber” only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was “absolutely lovely.”  So guess who wasn’t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a “little vulture.”  Why did Meghan’s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It’s unclear — maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.’s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? “Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,” he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.” Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, “We are all still family.” We’re guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.’s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them — they recently landed in London, where they’ll be acting as wedding correspondents for “Good Morning Britain.”    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they’re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her “amazing.” Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: “Divorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London’s tabloid media, is next level.” Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold — for now.  Is there any drama on Harry’s side of the family?  Have you seen “The Crown”? You have? Good. That’s probably all the intense Windsor drama you’re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list — it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill — some distant relatives who were invited to William’s wedding were not invited to Harry’s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don’t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What’s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan’s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the “People’s Princess.” Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan’s overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting — in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, “Ohhh, yes,” according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: “I think it’s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].” He then noted that they are all “stuck together for the rest of our lives,” to which Meghan added, “Togetherness at its finest.”    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man — “It could be a sensitive subject,” he joked on a radio show — Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won’t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry “just want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.” William and Kate’s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry’s wedding]  Are Harry’s exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There’s also precedent: Several of William’s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles’s then-ex-girlfriend — now his wife, Duchess Camilla — attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from “Suits,” the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls — British royalty in their own right — likely will, too, along with Meghan’s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.

Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.  Despite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family.

Despite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.  The Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.  The news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan’s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she’s not making a permanent move there.',\n",

Prior to the show, Patrick told For The Win she prepped by practicing her monologue to ensure the jokes were delivered in her voice. She took plenty of shots at other athletes — including LeBron James, Tiger Woods and the U.S. men’s soccer team — and said that when she was often the target of jokes, she took it as a compliment because she was “important enough” to be thought of.  “I loved the creative process and coming up with ideas and jokes and putting in my two cents there, along with the help of a dozen highly qualified writers,” Patrick told FTW by phone Saturday.  So because there were some highs and lows at the show, here are Patrick’s best and worst jokes.  The Best  1. A topical joke, for the win  “The Caps won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. And Alex Ovechkin couldn’t be any happier. I haven’t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since, well, two days ago.”  2. Tiger back?  Through the self-deprecating humor Patrick promised, she took a shot at Tiger Woods and herself — but also her trolls on social media who constantly questioned why people cared about her NASCAR and IndyCar careers when she only won one race in 14 years on the track.  “Tiger Woods is back. Sort of I guess. I mean, why do people keep talking about this guy who isn’t winning? Who does he think he is? Me?”  3. Sorry, Cleveland  “No matter what else is going on in the world, sports have always had the power to inspire and give hope… unless those people are from Cleveland.”  4. Another punch  Following an awkward joke about LeBron James’ hair (see below in The Worst), Danica made a great joke about poor J.R. Smith not knowing what the score was during Game 1 of the NBA Finals.  “That’s OK. LeBron, when he hosted, he made fun of me too. I’d say we’re even. J.R. Smith would say we’re up by one!”  That one was met with heavy applause. And she continued…  “Yeah, he made quite the little oopsie in the playoffs this year. You know, it’s not good when you have 100 tattoos and none of them are your biggest mistake.”  5. Keeping Up with the Kardashians  Philadelphia 76s star Ben Simmons is reportedly dating Kendall Jenner, so who could resist an easy target?  “So many big NBA moves this offseason. Kawhi Leonard went to the Raptors, Dwight Howard went to the Wizards and Ben Simmons went to the Kardashians.”  6. Adam Rippon’s Instagram stardom  While highlighting the amazing performances by Team USA in the 2018 Winter Olympics, Patrick said:  “Our gold-medal winning women’s hockey team is here, gold medalist Chloe Kim is here and Instagram’s Adam Rippon is here… I’m told he also won a medal.”  Cut to Rippon — who won a figure skating bronze medal in South Korea — who was hilariously posing like he would for his Instagram account, which is spectacularly entertaining. He stole the show briefly with this joke, but it was cute all around.  7. A short joke  Danica is only about 5-foot-2, so she doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on here when teasing Houston Astros’ All-Star second baseman José Altuve. But as someone who’s in the same height range, this writer always appreciates short jokes.  “World Series champion José Altuve is here. And when I say it’s incredible that José can reach the top of his profession without being able to reach the top shelf of his locker, it’s out of respect.”  The Worst  1. It started off fine…  Patrick threw a jab at the NFL’s new policy that players must stand for the national anthem if they’re on the field, which the players themselves found ridiculous and pointed out how it still misses the point of the peaceful protests. But then the joke continued as she addressed “the elephant in the room” with the national anthem controversy, and an image of Fergie appeared on the screen behind her.  “Give it up for the U.S. men’s curling team, they also took home gold. And for those unfamiliar, curling is the sport where you are allowed to kneel. It’s encouraged. “That’s right, we have to mention the elephant in the room. It’s time to talk about the national anthem controversy. (Cut to an image of Fergie.) I don’t know what Fergie was thinking either.”  This was just a bad joke involving serious issues, like of racial injustice and police brutality, and Philadelphia Eagles’ Chris Long — one of the leading advocates for peaceful protests — was seen saying it was bad. However, it turns out he was talking about Fergie’s terrible performance from the NBA All-Star Game.  For the record geniuses I was talking about Fergie https://t.co/sZN4tyw9Rz — Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) July 19, 2018  2. Odell Beckham Jr.’s hair  “Odell is, once again, healthy and will return to the field next season, but his hair style’s still listed as questionable.”  We’ve heard this one before, and Patrick’s delivery was a little bit off. However, Patrick also appeared on stage wearing a shorts suit, saying she borrowed it from OBJ. He seemed to enjoy that quip a little more.  3. And then LeBron James’ hair  This one just straight up fell flat, and the timing was all kinds of off.  “Who doesn’t love LeBron James? He’s one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and now, LeBron is the newest Los Angeles transplant. Los Angeles transplant is also what he Googles when he needs new hair.”  4. No, the USMNT wasn’t in the World Cup  If you haven’t heard by now, the soccer tournament that started more than a month ago and ended last weekend didn’t include the U.S.  “Congratulations to France on winning the World Cup. I’d make a joke about the U.S. soccer team, but they didn’t qualify for this monologue.”  5. KD’s burners  Patrick closed her monologue with one final joke, this one aimed at Kevin Durant. It was funny, but not new and seemed like a missed opportunity to throw a punch at the 76ers.  “It’s time to give out some awards tonight. Remember, the ESPYS are voted on by all of you. And there’s no greater honor than being recognized by actual fans. This year, millions of them cast their votes on Twitter, and only 1,000 were from Kevin Durant’s burner accounts.”  Bonus:  This wasn’t part of her monologue, but the costumes were great for Patrick and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s Game of Thrones non-sketch.',\n",
       " \"The daughter of pop legend Michael Jackson has emerged as the favourite to play Madonna is a movie about her life.  Producers reportedly want 19-year-old Paris Jackson to take the lead in the Vogue singer's biopic Blonde Ambition.  The film will explore the iconic singer's life and doppelganger Paris is seen as the perfect person to bring the role to life.  Scroll down for video  Seeing double: The daughter of pop icon Michael Jackson, Paris Jackson (pictured on a photoshoot in January, left) has emerged as the favourite to play Madonna (pictured in the late 80s, right) is a big screen biopic of her life, set in 1980s New York  A source close to the movie revealed to the Daily Mirror: 'Madonna is not supporting the film yet but the makers are hoping to cast someone who she will love.  'At the moment they are in talks with Paris. If she agrees it will be a massive coup for \\xadproducers as Madonna is a big fan of Paris.'  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Paris, who declined to comment.  However, Madonna is apparently not on board with the film and previously criticised the script.  Actress: Paris received rave reviews for her debut acting performance in the American TV series Star  It is set in 1980s New York and follows Madonna's rise to fame and the release of her self-titled smash hit debut album.  But Madonna said: 'Why would Universal Studios want to make a movie about me based on a script that is all lies?'  During an epic Carpool Karaoke session with James Corden, the 58-year-old confessed she 'tongue in mouth kissed' the late singer.  Doppelganger: In January she was pictured on a Chanel shoot striking a significant resemblance to Madonna  She also admitted it was she who made the first move 'because he was a little shy', adding, 'But he was a willing accomplice.'  Paris' resemblance to the Queen of Pop hasn't gone unnoticed.  In January she was pictured on a Chanel shoot striking a significant resemblance to Madonna, sporting her hair in an 80s inspired bouffant updo and wearing a slick of ruby red lipstick.  Flashback: The film title comes from that of Madonna's legendary 1990 world tour, which Alex Keshishian immortalized in the raucous documentary Madonna: Truth Or Dare  The photoshoot, which appeared in the April 2017 edition of Harper's Bazaar, caused a fan frenzy on social media at the time.  Even Paris was struck by the resemblance, sharing a fan made collage of photos of herself and Madonna side by side on Twitter, captioned, '@Madonna some of the edits people send me get pretty wild but i'm kinda starting to dig it'.  Paris has branched out into acting of late and received rave reviews for her debut acting performance in the American TV series Star.  The Fox show is centred on three women who form their own pop group while Paris played a social media guru.\",\n",

       " 'P!nk Hands 12 -Year-Old Superfan the Mic at Her Concert & Is Blown Away: Watch  Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist\\'s song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink\\'s concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the \"Beautiful Trauma\" singer: \"when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,\" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn\\'t get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.

       " 'No time to waste! Kylie Jenner isn’t going to let the first year of 4-month-old daughter Stormi pass her by without planning for the best 1st birthday bash Calabasas has ever seen.  The 20-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star revealed her plans for the celebration — or lack thereof — with followers in a series of Snapchat videos on Wednesday, June 27.  “Stormi is gonna be 5 months this weekend, which really is tripping me,” she began the first Snap. “That means we’re halfway to a year — almost — and I’m already thinking about her first birthday and how it’s going to be epic, OK?”  She continued to reveal that she had already decided on a theme, but sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian used it for their daughters’ joint birthday parties earlier in June. “I was going to do super magical unicorn theme, but North and Penelope beat me to it, so I have to think of something else.”  Jenner welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1. The lip-kit maven kept her pregnancy news under wraps until the birth announcement post on social media three days after the baby’s arrival.  “I understand you’re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world,” the reality star wrote at the time. “I knew for myself i needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way i knew how. there was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal i had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”  The Life of Kylie star wasn’t shy about sharing sweet pics and videos of the baby girl until earlier this month, when she revealed that she’s not sharing photos of her little one “right now” after a followers accused her of cutting Stormi out of a selfie.  “Yeah I cut my baby out. I’m not sharing photos of my girl right now,” Jenner responded. She also went a step further and deleted all of the previously shared photos.

       " 'John Mayer recently got super candid and revealed that his new song, ‘Still Feel Like Your Man,’ is all about his ex, Katy Perry. The emotional track makes it very clear that he’s missing his ex big time. So, is he going hard to get her back? Here’s what we know!  Katy Perry, 32, and John Mayer, 39, had a very intense — and tumultuous — relationship. They dated on and off from August 2012 until they finally split for good in 2015. Katy moved on to Orlando Bloom, 40, and it seemed like John was history. But a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that John has never given up on winning her back.  “John was practically jumping for joy when he found out about her breakup with Orlando,” says our source. “Since then he’s been bombarding her with calls and flowers. He’s written her poetry and songs, getting her back is all her cares about these days.” So sweet!  John has a history of going hot and cold on Katy so we’re not surprised that she hasn’t gone running straight back to him. But his new song ‘Still Feel Like Your Man’ has got to be pulling at her heart strings a little. With lyrics like “I still keep your shampoo in my shower, in case you want to wash your hair” and “Still think I’m never going to find another you,” the song is a serious tear jerker.  But John isn’t stopping with love songs and flowers, he’s also started talking babies! The sexy singer just opened up to The New York Times and revealed that he’s ready to settle down and have a family. “That’s the final frontier, man,” he admitted.

The pop star - who earned $16 million last year - spent a total of $10,956,873.91 in 2016 with most of her money going on massages and clothes, according to TMZ.  Legal documents show the mother-of-two dropped a whopping $122,613 on massages - no doubt because of her grueling workouts and back-to-back shows in Las Vegas - as well as manicures and other personal grooming.  Shopping: Britney Spears spent nearly $11 million in 2016 according to legal documents seen by TMZ including a whopping $122,613 on massages and personal grooming  She also spent $69,668 on wardrobe and $24,392 for hair and makeup.  Another $29,852 goes to caring for her pet pooches - slightly less that last year's total of $37,000.  Britney also made numerous trips to stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pottery Barn, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons and Target, spending a few hundred dollars at a time.  The songstress is often spotted out in her local Los Angeles neighborhood picking up groceries or home-wares.  TMZ also revealed the Circus hitmaker has assets totaling $55,745,288.

The Dancing With the Stars pro and her 4-month old son, Shai, cover the June issue of Fit Pregnancy and Baby, and in her accompanying interview with the magazine, she gets candid about her surprise pregnancy, raising a newborn with fiancé Maksim Chmerkovskiy and returning to the dance competition show just two months after giving birth.    WATCH: Maksim Chmerkovskiy & Peta Murgatroyd Gush Over Their \\'Happy\\' First Date Night Since Son\\'s Birth  \"Maks and I were so careful, but one night we weren\\'t,\" she explains. \"Days later I had this massive hot flash and I thought, \\'I better take a test.\\' So I did. \\'What?! How?!\\' A tear went down my cheek, because I didn\\'t know what to do. I was thinking, \\'Do I go to work? Do I call 100 people?\\'\"  \"I called Maks, who was in Vegas, and said, \\'Well, I\\'m pregnant.\\' He thought I was kidding,\" she continues. \"When I told him I wasn\\'t, he said, \\'Wow, that\\'s good, babe,\\' in kind of a monotone. It was really weird! He added, \\'I\\'m in a car full of people. I love you so much. I\\'ll call you back.\\' He did a few minutes later and he was absolutely thrilled and came straight home to celebrate.\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  While pregnant, Murgatroyd continued to dance (that\\'s her profession, after all!), but admits it wasn\\'t fun -- especially with nausea. She remembers feeling extremely fatigued while rehearsing for season 22 of DWTS with Nyle DiMarco.  \"I\\'d literally fall asleep on the couch in the studio while I was supposed to be teaching Nyle,\" she recalls. \"Eventually Nyle said, \\'I know your secret.\\' He\\'d figured it out, because my boobs had grown and Maks was bringing me food every day. But Nyle and I won the season with me eight weeks pregnant!\"  WATCH: \\'Dancing With the Stars\\' Week 8 Dance Recap: Best Lifts, Kicks, Tricks and Flips!  The 30-year-old dancer confesses she also wasn\\'t a fan of the weight gain, but remained active throughout her pregnancy.  \"I gained about 40 pounds. My thighs got bigger. My boobs got bigger. My butt got ten times bigger,\" she remembers. \"I kept exercising -- light weights, walking on an incline on the treadmill and Pilates. Keeping up my core strength helped me push during the delivery.\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  \"Hormones mess with your emotions,\" she adds. \"During pregnancy, little things would set me off. I burst into tears because I thought the baby\\'s going-home outfit wasn\\'t the right color. Also, usually I\\'m obsessed with gourmet cheese. Maks came home with a bag full of it. He was being sweet, but I said, \\'I\\'ll puke if you make me eat that.\\' Instead I went through a pasta phase, eating it with oil and salt at six in the morning.\"  But all of those things no longer mattered when baby Shai finally arrived at 5:34 a.m. on Jan. 4, 2017, weighing in at 7 pounds 11 ounces.  \"Half the time Maks and I were laughing, half the time we were staring at the monitor. Sometime during the night, my water broke. I pushed for 30 minutes and he was here!\" she says. \"Suddenly my baby was on my chest. Maks and I were in shock for the first 30 seconds. Then Maks started to cry, and then I did too. Shai looked at me, took his first breath and just made a little noise.

She ultimately said yes, and was paired with Bachelor star Nick Viall. The two were sent home during week seven of the competition.  \"I got the call to come back on the show right after Shai was born. I said yes, but after I hung up, I said to Maks, \\'I don\\'t think I can do this,\\'\" she recalls. \"He reassured me. I returned with new agreements -- there\\'d be a limit to my hours. Even so, much of the time when I [went] to work, I [had] tears in my eyes. Shai gives me this beautiful smile, and all I want to do is stay home for an extra hour. Then I think, \\'The sooner I go, the sooner I can get back.\\' After work, I hurry home.\"  \"When I returned to work I still had 20 to 25 extra pounds on me,\" she continues. \"It was tough. But now, even with ten pounds to go, I feel good. I want to show women you should be proud of where you are. Don\\'t always look into the future, or you\\'ll miss the now. That said, I\\'d love to have my pre-baby boobs back by my wedding day!\"  Fit Pregnancy and Baby  ET recently caught up with Murgatroyd and Chmerkovskiy at the 24th Annual Race to Erase MS Gala in Los Angeles, where they opened up about how parenting has been going thus far.

       " 'Opening up. Big Brother alum Natalie Negrotti revealed that she is pansexual and dating a woman during the Tuesday, July 17, episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning. She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.  The former NFL cheerleader added: “She’s a really great fit for me, and she’s really special to me.”  Listen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie’s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it’s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.

       " 'EspañolThe current influenza season has been especially difficult, causing widespread illness that has affected all fifty states and resulted in a record number of hospitalizations. While healthcare professionals continue to combat this year’s flu – which may continue to affect Americans into April – we’re already partnering with other public health agencies to conduct essential work to produce next season’s influenza vaccines.As part of this process, we’re striving to better understand why we saw reduced effectiveness of this year’s influenza vaccines against one strain of influenza A, called H3N2. It was this strain that caused much of the influenza-related illness this flu season. Moreover, this year is not the first time we have seen vaccines be less effective against this particular strain of influenza, H3N2.As such, we are taking a number of actions to better understand why effectiveness tends to be lower against the H3N2 strain and what we can do about it. By looking closely at the available data and applying the lessons we learn each flu season to the vaccine development process, we offer the greatest chance of developing vaccines that even more effectively prevent the flu in the future.These lessons may be applied not only to enhancing the most prevalent process for developing influenza vaccine in eggs, but to considering whether greater investment in alternative processes such as cell-based or recombinant approaches to vaccine development are required. With this statement, I want to outline what we’ve learned so far about this season’s vaccines and the steps we’re taking and plan to take to determine the root cause of this year’s findings and better prepare for future flu seasons.Reduced effectiveness of 2017-2018 seasonal vaccines against H3N2There are a number of theories on why this season’s vaccines produced reduced effectiveness against H3N2. We’re taking steps to investigate each of these potential causes, rule out possible reasons for the variation in effectiveness and improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Overall, preliminary vaccine effectiveness reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for H3N2 influenza was 25 percent, which means that people who received the vaccine were 25 percent less likely to be sick and need to see a doctor.While that finding isn’t too far off from the vaccine effectiveness seen against H3N2 in previous years, we need to take new steps to improve vaccine efficacy against H3N2. Of note, the effectiveness of the vaccine against H3N2 in children 6 months to 8 years of age was 51 percent this season, yet the effectiveness in those 65 years and older was only 17 percent, and the effectiveness in older children and adults under 65 years of age was even lower. The vaccines did do much better for other viruses that are also causing the flu this season. The data show that overall vaccine effectiveness for H1N1 and influenza B was 67 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for all age groups combined.So why did this season’s vaccines not deliver higher protection against H3N2? And why have vaccines in prior seasons when H3N2 circulated, also delivered reduced protection against this particular flu strain?We don’t think it was a question of getting the particular H3N2 strain wrong when we set out to produce this season’s flu vaccines. Although adapting circulating virus strains for manufacture can lead to differences between the circulating strain and the one used for manufacturing that could affect effectiveness, so far the data we have suggests that the viruses provided by reference laboratories to manufacturers to make this year’s vaccines do reasonably match the circulating flu strains that are causing most of the illnesses, including H3N2.However, we’re working with our colleagues at CDC and other federal agencies to examine and address other factors that might be contributing to the less than optimal overall protection provided by this season’s vaccines against influenza. We would particularly like to understand why vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 influenza year-to-year tends to be lower than effectiveness against other influenza viruses.Working to determine the root causesToward these ends, scientists at FDA are collaborating with colleagues at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to use a large database that includes details of the flu vaccines administered to four million individuals along with whether they were hospitalized for influenza or treated with antiviral medications for influenza-like illness. This work, which is still underway, will try to better understand why overall effectiveness with both the cell-based and egg-based vaccines was less than optimal. We’re also looking at the difference in effectiveness in people 65 years and older who were vaccinated with high-dose influenza vaccine and adjuvanted influenza vaccine to see if effectiveness was better than in those vaccinated with standard dose vaccines. The adjuvanted influenza vaccine contains an ingredient meant to boost the immune system’s response to the vaccine while high dose vaccines contain four times as much of the influenza material or antigen as standard vaccines. What we learn about the differences in efficacy between these different vaccines might reveal information that can inform why overall effectiveness against H3N2 was lagging.What might this information reveal? One theory is that people might require a higher amount of H3N2 antigen to elicit a proper immune response to that particular strain of influenza. As I noted previously, the work conducted with CMS shows a preliminary finding that suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. We are working to follow up on that finding. We’re also combing through the data to see if there are other reasons for why this season’s vaccines were less effective against H3N2. Our scientists are currently working internally and collaborating with others inside and outside of the federal government to understand all of these findings.The knowledge we gain through such scientific research will allow us to determine if we need to change recommendations to vaccine manufacturers for how future season’s vaccines should be produced.Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 flu seasonWhile this scientific work is underway, the composition of next season’s flu vaccines will be the subject of an FDA advisory committee meeting March 1, 2018. As is done every year, the FDA convenes this panel to consider the recommendations made by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the composition of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere, and to help the FDA select strains for next season’s flu vaccines in the U.S. WHO has recommended changing two of the strains currently contained in this year’s influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere. The upcoming FDA advisory committee meeting will determine if these recommendations should also apply for the U.S. Following that meeting, the FDA will also work to apply all the knowledge that we gain from this year’s flu season to ensure that the best possible vaccines are available next season to protect against the flu.In the meantime, this flu season isn’t over yet, though CDC data shows a decline in visits to doctor’s offices and outpatient clinics. We must continue to be diligent in doing our part to prevent the spread of flu however possible, including remembering to wash your hands frequently and staying home when you are sick. It’s also not too late get vaccinated if you have not yet done so, given that we are starting to see a larger proportion of illnesses caused by H1N1 and B influenza for which vaccines offer better protection. Vaccinations have also been shown to reduce the severity of the flu in people who get sick. People who are very sick with flu-like symptoms and those who are at high risk of serious flu complications should see a healthcare professional as soon as possible to see if they should be treated with antiviral drugs.The FDA remains committed to determining the root cause for the shortcomings observed in the effectiveness of this season’s flu vaccine against H3N2, notifying the public of our work as we gain new insights, and applying what we learn to future vaccine development. Our aim is to make sure we continue to improve the effectiveness of future flu vaccines, and encourage more people to seek vaccination.The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.###',\n",

Cassidy, now 66, told People Magazine in a recent interview that he is struggling with memory loss related to dementia.  Former \"Partridge Family\" star David Cassidy says he\\'s struggling with memory loss.  The 66-year-old actor-singer tells People magazine his family has a history of dementia and he had sensed \"this was coming.\" He says for now he wants to stay focused and \"enjoy life.\"  Cassidy’s revelation follows a recent concert in Agoura Hills, California, where he reportedly struggled to remember lyrics to songs he had been singing for nearly 50 years.  The performer has had numerous personal problems in the decades following his initial success, ranging from substance abuse to bankruptcy. He\\'s the stepson of actress and fellow \"Partridge Family\" star Shirley Jones.  Cassidy had announced early this year that he planned to wrap up his 50-year career by the end of 2017.

       " 'Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  “Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”  “They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.  “The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”  For more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

       " 'Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards  Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors, surpassing Adele\\'s mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.  Watch  \"It\\'s crazy that we\\'re all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we\\'re here,\" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point: \"Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight.\" (Hudgens acknowledged that shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake\\'s afterparty.)  By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening\\'s final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele\\'s previous record of 12 in 2012. It\\'s an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single \"One Dance\" featuring WizKid and Kyla.  \"Life is like toilet paper,\" he said while accepting his final award. \"Either you\\'re on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.\"  Cher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs \"Believe\" and \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" -- sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance -- a day after her 71st birthday. \"I\\'ve wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I\\'ve been doing it for 53 years,\" she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. \"I think luck has so much to do with with my success... I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.\"  Drake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyoncé earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyoncé (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyoncé were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.  The show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track \"No Frauds,\" which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta\\'s \"Light My Body Up,\" Jason Derulo\\'s \"Swalla\" and her own \"Regret In Your Tears,\" bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles -- Cabello\\'s first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief \"I Have Questions\" and a heated-up \"Crying In the Club,\" and Cyrus\\' country-tinged comeback release \"Malibu\" -- while Lorde (\"Green Light,\" performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (\"Body Like a Back Road\") and John Legend (\"Surefire\"), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL\\'s \"H.O.L.Y.,\" all chipped in with memorable performances.  Hudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake\\'s unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion\\'s \"Power of Love\" and Nicki Minaj\\'s verse from \"Monster,\" impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.  Speaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song \"My Heart Will Go On\" 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard\\'s oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.  Diddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper\\'s 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can\\'t Stop, Won\\'t Stop. \"It all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,\" Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy\\'s creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. \"Big sold over 25 million records worldwide; his Ready to Die album, his Life After Death album, classics... Biggie was the best rapper I ever had the chance to work with. Watching him and seeing him work is something that words can\\'t explain.\"  Bruno Mars, whose recent awards show performances have leaned more towards glitzy funk showstoppers like \"24K Magic\" and his excellent tribute to Prince alongside The Time during the Grammys earlier this year, took a different route for this one, getting passionate with his latest single \"Versace On the Floor\" as the show wound towards its conclusion.  But there was only one way it would end: with Drake complete his record-breaking evening with the top award to go with his new place in BBMA history. His huge night catapulted him into the top 10 of artists who have won the most Billboard Music Awards over the years, though he still has a way to go to catch Taylor Swift at 21. But with the March release of his playlist-album More Life already shattering records he\\'d set last year with Views, it\\'s hard to imagine he won\\'t be gracing BBMA stages for years to come.',\n",

The unlikely duo filmed themselves getting their palms read during Tuesday’s Tonight Show and they naturally had some fun while doing it.  “You have a wonderful long life line.

       " '(If you’re having trouble viewing this video on a mobile device, click here.)  Where’s Kylie? That’s the question Kardashian fans were asking when the reality TV family finally unveiled their annual Christmas card Monday afternoon but a reportedly pregnant Kylie Jenner was noticeably absent.  In fact, fans were fuming on Twitter and elsewhere that they had fallen for what turned out to be a 25-day-long tease to the card’s release.  Each day, starting Dec. 1, Kim Kardashian and other members of the clan released a photo from the family’s Christmas card photo shoot, showing different group shots, including of Kim and Kanye West with their two kids, North and Saint.  Fans had expected that 20-year-old Kylie, reported to be well into her first pregnancy with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, would finally display her baby bump on the Dec. 25 card.  Instead, the card showed nearly all the Kardashian-Jenner women and grandchildren, including Kris Jenner and grandmother Mary Jo “M.J.” Houghton. But there was no Kylie Jenner.  Khloe Kardashian was there, though with no baby bump yet visible, possibly because the photo shoot took place sometime in early November, E! News reported. She already had confirmed her pregnancy on Dec. 20 with a baby bump photo posted to her Instagram account.  Khloe’s long-expected public acknowledgement that, yes, she is having a baby with NBA star Tristan Thompson raised fans’ expectations that Kylie would use the family’s annual card to publicly confirm her pregnancy as well.  But when Kylie didn’t, fans seemed ready to declare a national state of emergency or a state of something related to the family.  “Maybe we should call the authorities because @KylieJenner is still missing from the damn Kardashian Christmas card,” one fan tweeted.  “I need to see the BELLY,” wrote another.  “I hate that I am so invested in Kylie Jenner’s alleged pregnancy,” another tweeted.  Others grew more belligerent and hurled expletives:  “Lmaoooooo THEY MIND F—KED US ALL MONTH LONG!!!!” one put it bluntly. “What is this total f—kery they have done to us!!! C’mon @KylieJenner @KimKardashian we wanted Kylie on the damn 25th day!!!”  But the young lip kit mogul wasn’t in total hiding on Christmas Day. She and big brother Rob Kardashian, who also was absent from the family holiday card photos, appeared on Khloe’s Snapchat on Monday. Kylie also shared a photo of herself on the cover of Love magazine, though the photo only showed her face.  Still her absence from the Christmas card itself left fans wondering if she’ll ever confirm her pregnancy or what other occasion she’s holding out for — perhaps for the next season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”  Here are some more fan reactions:  this would’ve been the perfect marketing ploy. so why didn’t they use it? where is kylie and that bump? pic.twitter.com/E77ur2KJnY — 💿 (@squareups) December 26, 2017  She must be behind that tree — 🌻📷 (@IviweVikki) December 26, 2017',\n",

       " \"Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer‘s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City — stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel’s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn.  From there, it was one fight after the next — each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  First there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her “I don’t want to be schooled by you right now and I don’t like the way you’re speaking to me.” Then there was Singer’s Berkshires blowout — where she criticized everything from Frankel’s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: “You didn’t have any money until you f—–. You would date every guy for their f—— money”).  It only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation — causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. “My f—— heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,” Singer said, tearing up. “So don’t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don’t. Don’t. Just don’t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It’s not always about you.”  Bethenny Frankel Bravo  Ramona Singer Bravo  Eventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace — having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped.  “I’m f—ed up, okay? I’m f—ed up,” Singer said. “I’m a miserable person, I’m horrible, I’m a bad friend, I don’t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I’ll never do that again. … I don’t want to be that person. I care about you and I don’t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.”  “That s— has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?” Frankel told her in response. “I don’t want you to be that person. I know you don’t know. You’re not bad — you’re not an evil person. … I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.”  Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo  So where does Frankel and Singer’s friendship stand now?  On Wednesday’s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce — even hugging at the end.  “The thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,” Frankel told Singer. “I’m not angry at you — I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don’t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.”  “I don’t want to be close, but I don’t not not like you is where I am with you,” she said, quoting Singer’s iconic “I don’t not not like you” from earlier in the season. “I’m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.”  Her words resonated with Singer. “I feel it from you. I’m honestly happy we’re in this place. I really feel better,” she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren’t in that good of a place. “At least [Bethenny’s] talking to me. She’s not icing me out. So for me, that’s good!”  Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Bravo  Singer spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions — even admitting that she “cringed” when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor.  “It was blind range,” she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. “I was so angry, it was blind range.”  She was also blind drunk too. “I had a few too many,” Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. “I wasn’t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don’t take Xanax.”  “Looking back, I looked like an a——. I don’t know what I was thinking the whole damn season,” Singer added. “I just lost my whole mojo for weeks on end because Bethenny was so upset with me — which I can understand in retrospect. But I just didn’t know how to make it right and it just got worse. And it was just a horrible moment in my life.”  Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Luann D'Agostino Bravo  Still, despite “owning” her bad behavior, Singer remained steadfast that her original question about Frankel’s naked-film past was innocent.  “My delivery sucked at that lunch. [But] it was not coming out of viciousness, it was not coming out of maliciousness,” Singer said, explaining that she had been sent the article from a friend a week before talking with Frankel about it.  “My first concern in the back of my head was remembering that [former New York City Housewife] Alex McCord had a naked picture in one of the weeklies [in season 1],” Singer recalled. “And [my daughter Avery’s] school was upset, she was almost asked to leave. … I was like, ‘Oh my God, I hope everything’s okay with Bryn. I hope no one’s saying anything.’ “  Bethenny Frankel, Andy Cohen, and Ramona Singer Bravo  FROM PEN: Andy Cohen’s Pick For The Most Absurd Real Housewives’ Business Ever  Frankel didn’t buy it. “The article brought up something that had already been in the press years ago and I wrote in a book had come out six weeks before,” she told Singer. “So when you came to that very intimate time to speak to me mother-to-mother in a very public restaurant and bring me this smoking gun, it wasn’t that it was the delivery. It was the content, it was the intention — it was malicious.”  “I was going through a bad situation in my personal life and despite that, I didn’t come at you at all,” Frankel continued, looking back at their season of blows. “Not one time did I attack you. You attacked my entire career and insinuated I slept my way to I don’t know where, but I never attacked you not one time, Ramona. …You’ve been disgusting to me.”  RHONY REWIND: Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Fight on the Brooklyn Bridge  The two continued to go back and forth — Frankel bringing up past arguments (the Brooklyn Bridge!) and Singer maintaining that she was always a good friend (“I’ve been so there for you on so many levels”).  But in the end, none of that mattered as the two decided to put down their (metaphorical) guns and focus on moving on.  ‘Til next season …\",\n",

There\\'s a lot of sun on the mountaintop ... which is being on top of my career,\" Bundchen explained. \"And then the valley is ... you know, is the quieter place. It\\'s the families, the home. It\\'s where you do the work that doesn\\'t get seen, but it\\'s so important.\"  Venturelli/Getty Images, FILE  A native of Brazil, Bundchen now lives outside of Boston with her husband, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots\\' quarterback.  The couple have two children together, and Bundchen said she has \"always wanted to be a mom\" and \"have a family.\"  \"When I became a mother,\" she added, \"it really became my priority.\"  \"I just wanted to be with my kids,\" she said. \"I couldn\\'t ... see anything more important than being there for them ... and to be there for my husband too.\"  ABC News  Despite this, transitioning from an international supermodel to domestic life took some time to adjust to, she said.  \"I was actually living what I love so much, which is being a mom, and a nurturer, and taking care of my family,\" Bundchen said. \"It was just very different than what I was used to. So it took some time to adjust.\"  John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images, FILE  Bundchen opens up about her deeply personal journey to self-acceptance in her new book, \"Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life.\"  In the book, she details how she used to suffer from crippling panic attacks in her 20s.  \"That was definitely rock bottom for me,\" Bundchen said of that time period.  One panic attack was so severe Bundchen said it led her to contemplate suicide.  She said she is sharing these \"very private\" and \"very vulnerable\" stories now \"with the hopes that people don\\'t feel alone.\"  \"It was like I was trapped and I couldn\\'t breathe, and even outside of my own balcony,\" she recalled of a severe panic attack she had years ago. \"And from that moment on, you know, I realized that my life needed to change.\"  After overcoming the urge to jump from that balcony, Bundchen committed to a full lifestyle change: Trading in cigarettes, wine and sugary coffee drinks for a clean, plant-based diet.

She described meditation as \"being in the place in the seat of the observer versus in the monkey mind.\"  \"Somebody told me a quote that I thought was fantastic one time: \\'The mind is an instrument, don\\'t let it play you,\\'\" she added.

Again.\"  Maynard said that she realized that she\\'d given birth to Jennings \"like, two seconds ago,\" and added, \"I guess I should’ve read that part in the baby handbook that says you’re super fertile after giving birth, huh?\"  But unexpected or not, she and Johnson couldn\\'t be happier about their growing family.  \"I said about two weeks after Jennings was born that I couldn’t wait to have another,\" Maynard explained. \"I just had no clue it would happen so quickly! Some of my closest friends have had a really hard time getting pregnant and my heart breaks for them, so I’m just so grateful for this blessing God has given our family.\"  This will be the third child for Maynard, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Ricki, from her relationship with late NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick.  So much has changed in Maynard\\'s life over the past few years. In 2011, she received the final rose from Brad Womack on Season 15 of \"The Bachelor.\" But months after the finale, they parted ways.

       " 'Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are desperately trying to settle their divorce — and he’s selling assets to pay her off!  RadarOnline.com has learned the cash-starved star, 45, has put an 87-acre plantation near Savannah, Ga., on the block for $8.9 million.  The Gone Girl hunk reportedly paid $7.1 million for the spread on a private island after falling in love with the area while filming 1999’s Forces of Nature.  “Ben is selling because of the divorce,” said a source close to the estranged A-listers.  PHOTOS: Ben Affleck Caught Leaving Church With Kids, Two Days After Rehab Meeting!  “He needs the cash, which will go to Jen as part of the settlement. He’s compensating her for his infidelities and the damage caused in the marriage.”  As Radar reported, Affleck just shelled out $19 million for a mansion located less than a mile from the home Garner shares with their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  While a source close to Affleck dismissed talk of a baby, insiders snitched there is added urgency to the move as Affleck is setting up a nest with Lindsay Shookus!  PHOTOS; The Way They Were — Look Back At Divorcing Jennifer Garner & Ben Affleck’s Happier Times  The Saturday Night Live producer and her five-year-old daughter have reportedly already moved in.  But Shookus’ new status as neighbor has Garner fuming, sources said.  “It’s too close to comfort for Jen,” said a spy. “It could lead to her asking for more money!”  Affleck and Garner, 46, have been in mediation to settle their divorce.  PHOTOS: Ben Leaves Jen! Affleck Flies To Europe & Ditches Garner With The Kids  Although Affleck is believed to be worth as much as $105 million and Garner $60 million, they’ve said they’ll split what was earned during their marriage.  “You would have to figure out what portion of that is community property and what is separate property,” California divorce attorney Alistair Shaw told Radar.  Still, Affleck will likely also owe child support and possible spousal support, he added.  PHOTOS: Jennifer Garner Stays ‘West Virginia Strong’ Amid Affleck Divorce Drama  “California has a formula for figuring out child support,” Alistair explained.  “It depends on a lot of factors, such as who will spend more time with the kids, monthly income and other variables.”  We pay for juicy info!

Despite keeping their relationship super private, Rihanna, 29, and Hassan Jameel, stepped out on Grammys night, proving they’re still going strong. However, Hassan — a billionaire businessman and Toyota heir — is stressing over RiRi’s ex, Chris Brown, 28. “He is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past,” a source close to Rihanna tells HollywoodLife.com.

With that being said, “Hassan doesn’t trust Chris and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.”  Although the insider says Rihanna has opened up to Hassan about her relationship with Chris and assured him that that’s all part of her past, Hassan isn’t entirely convinced. “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy,” the source admits. “Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”  Rihanna and Hassan have yet to confirm their relationship since they were first romantically linked in June 2017. The pair were photographed in each other’s arms amidst a make-out session at a private villa in Spain. However, both RiRi and Hassan have kept things under wraps, only stepping out separately and never being photographed in the same shot.

This isn\\'t fan laziness, though; it\\'s clear that at one point, Disick did have his own page, but it\\'s since been deleted. Perhaps the man values his privacy or this is another example of Kris Jenner trying to control the family\\'s branding. Whatever the reason, we did a little digging, some actual reporting, and a lot of gathering to bring you the Wikipedia entry LD deserves:  Scott Disick  [edit]  Scott \"Lord\" Disick (born May 26, 1983[1]) is an American television personality and entrepreneur. He is best known for being the boyfriend of Kourtney Kardashian and father to their three children: Mason Dash, Penelope Scotland and Reign Aston.[2]  Disick has played himself on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord, Punk\\'d[3], Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, and Kourtney & Khloé Take the Hamptons.[4]  Early Life  Scott Disick grew up in Eastport, NY.

       " '© Larry Busacca / WireImage for Sony BMG Music Entertainment / . Kevin Federline and Britney Spears attend the Sony/BMG Grammys afterparty on Feb. 8, 2006. After months of back and forth, a formal court filing, intense pressure and behind-the-scenes negotiations, Britney Spears and Kevin Federline have reached a new agreement concerning child support for their sons, Sean Preston, 13, and Jayden James, 12.    According to a new report from The Blast, Britney and Kevin just settled out of court -- and everyone\\'s happy with their new agreement.  Kevin had been getting $20,000 a month in child support for the last decade. But back in February, K-Fed and his lawyer launched a campaign to convince the pop star, who divorced him in 2007, to pay him more support for the boys since she makes far more money these days than she was earning at the time of their split as she struggled with mental health issues. In May, Kevin filed court papers formally requesting an increase.  Sources close to the negotiations tell The Blast that Britney\\'s lawyer, Laura Wasser, and Kevin\\'s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, ultimately hashed out a deal that will pay Kevin \"thousands more a month\" in child support, The Blast writes, noting that \"several other items\" are also a part of the new deal, though the specific terms of their agreement are confidential.  A judge recently ordered Britney to pay Kevin $100,000 to cover his legal fees amid their negotiations too.  My kids are growing up so fast. Kaleb just hit 14 and is going to be a beast. Kori’s gonna be 16 in 2 days. The time goes so fast. I love this squad so much. Even my dog tried smiling for this pic 🤣🤣 @echoshadow_9000 @kmjf2004 @crownv_16 A post shared by Kevin Federline (@federline4real) on Jul 29, 2018 at 9:11am PDT  Back in July, The Blast reported that Britney\\'s dad, Jamie Spears -- who is also her legal guardian under her ongoing conservatorship -- had reached out to his former son-in-law to privately offer Kevin somewhere in the ballpark of an additional $10,000 a month.  But K-Fed\\'s lawyer didn\\'t want the former backup dancer -- who has six kids with three woman (Britney, ex Shar Jackson and current wife Victoria Prince) -- to accept Jamie\\'s proposal, as Kevin\\'s team believed he should get far more.  According to court filings, Britney earned $56.5 million in 2017, \"Entertainment Tonight\" reported in August. Kevin, who works as a DJ these days and earns about $3,000 a month, told the court in May, The Blast reported, that his income \"has changed significantly since the child support was last modified in approximately 2008 because I no longer earn a six-figure income like I did in 2008. I am no longer able to perform as a dancer due to my age, and I have not been as successful in putting out new music as I was in 2008. I am simply less of a \\'name\\' and less in demand than I was in 2008, which has negatively affected my income.\"  Britney launched her \"Piece of Me\" residency at Planet Hollywood\\'s AXIS Theater in December 2013 and the show grossed an estimated $130 million during its four-year, nearly 250-show run, Billboard reported. Her next Vegas show, an upcoming two-year residency at the Park Theater at The Park MGM, is expected to earn her nearly $500,000 per show.  Love when we go to our favorite spot on Sundays 💕🥞 The boys are bigger than me now!!!!! 😜 A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on May 29, 2018 at 12:59pm PDT  Britney had also long been paying for the boys\\' private school tuition and extracurricular activities. Mail Online reports that those expenses totalled about $15K per month.  It\\'s been reported that these days, the pop star and Kevin have custody of their sons for roughly the same amount of time, though Preston and Jayden spent extra time with their mom over the summer while she was on tour. \"[Kevin] knows it\\'s better for her when they\\'re on the road with her,\" an insider told Us Weekly.

       " 'Simone Alexandra Johnson is a model and the eldest daughter to Dywane Johnson; father, the famous ring wrestler known as the rock, who switched into the movie industry in 1999 and Dany Garcia; mother, a film producer, talent manager, business person and philanthropist.  Simone Alexandra Johnson Wiki, Age  Simone was born on August 14, 2001, in Davie, Florida United state but it was not long before her parents Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia got a divorce in 2008 after being together for 10 years.  She has tried within her power to keep her profile low despite being the daughter of a wrestler and movie star and the only means she uses to get to the world about herself is through social media platforms especially on her Instagram page where has over 189 thousand followers. Her captions on most of her pictures tell how amazingly she has moulded herself into becoming a strong woman. More so, her dad once made a post on his Instagram page about how he believed women are as strong as hell.  Dwyane Johnson is not the only wrestler in Simone’s lineage, her grandpa and great-grandfather are wrestlers and they have all derived their stage names from adding the ‘Rock’ to it.  Simone welcomed a baby sister Jasmine Johnson with her stepmom Lauren Hashiann, Jasmine was born in the month of December 16, 2015  See Also: Dany Garcia Wiki, Bio, Relationship With Dwayne Johnson, Age, Net Worth  Simone Alexandra Johnson’s Height and Body Stats  As a typical American, Simone has golden brown eyes and dark hair; she is 5’10 ft tall and she models for IMG models.

Dwyane Johnson once publicly announced how he has not approved of Simone dating just yet, in his own words, he boldly said he would choke anyone who comes around her with that intention. However, on Simone’s part, she has put full concentration on her career and studies not having time for side attractions despite her many followers on social media platforms.  Simone noted in an interview that she intends to pursue a business degree in college and embark on a career in sports entertainment after which she would then like to transit to talent management just like her parents, obviously indicating how much she looks up to her parents as role models.  Simone Alexandra’s Relationship with Dwayne Johnson  Most people thought Dwayne Johnson’s bond with his daughter Simone would be shaky when his divorce from her mother was finalised, however, the bond only got stronger and she is often seen as her father’s alibi. It has also been said that Simone can be hilarious because she even uses father’s lines on him ‘can you smell what the rock is cooking’.  The random statement of girls being closer to their fathers rather than their mothers is expressively displayed in Simone’s life. Dwyane Johnson has severally displayed affection for his daughter Simone not only in the private aspect of her life also in public.  He has been his daughter’s inspiration and role model as she really wants to follow his footsteps when she gets older. She has also picked interest in being a WWE superstar in the nearest future.

He let Simone follow him to all his super duper occasions and events. At the age of 15, Simone has amazingly walked down a lot of red carpet occasions while her father proudly showed her off. One of the trendy news Hollywood gave about Simone in 2017 was derived at the People’s Choice Award 2017 where Simone turned heads at the red carpet in an elegant black dress and her father Johnson gave her a gentle amazing kiss on the cheek before he accepted his award.  It is quite beautiful how Simone has not wasted the opportunities rendered by her parents into modelling her to be an amazing young woman. Considering the rumour of her Father Johnson planning to run for elections in 2020 we would expect an amazing first daughter.',\n",

Let’s discuss it all.”  These 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn't do or being victimized & left helpless. Let’s discuss it all. Stassi@juststassi.com — Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017  As previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called “Are We on a Male Witch Hunt?” Schroeder claimed that many victims were originally “willing” to go to hotel rooms and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the “hashtag me too trend.” She also stated that “no one can make me suck someone’s d–k.”  Many listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be insensitive views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers — including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge — also spoke out against Schroeder’s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.  Some fans were not swayed by the reality star’s mea culpa and accused her of apologizing only for the sake of her business.

       " 'Grey’s Anatomy star Caterina Scorsone has opened up about her character Amelia Shepherd and revealed she will have lighter experiences going forward!  On the latest episode, Shepherd had a massive tumor removed from her brain and is on the road to recovery. Scorsone revealed that she thinks this trauma will allow Amelia to have a new perspective on life and start a new chapter. “I think, obviously, things are looking up for Amelia. They can’t get much more down,” Scorsone shared.  “I know that this whole season, there’s been the emphasis on bringing some of the lighthearted humor back, infusing it into the show in the way that we had it a little earlier on… When Amelia was on Private Practice her voice was really quite comedic and humorous. I think that again, now that we’ve gotten through this very tragic story line, I’m anticipating and I’m starting to see there’s a lot of lightness in store.”  Aside from the tumor, Scorsone also commented on her character’s on-and-off relationship with Owen. “People are complicated and relationships are complicated,” she explained matter-of-factly. “There’s so much love and there’s so much that they’ve shared, and yet there’s so much trauma and hurt and there’s just so much to wade through in terms of what was real and what wasn’t and what hurts and what was good.”  She added, “So I’m sure the feelings are not straightforward for the two of them.”  Grey’s Anatomy airs at 8 pm on Thursdays on ABC.',\n",

The 27-year-old Victoria\\'s Secret model and 25-year-old New York Giants wide receiver tied the knot this weekend in a ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, according to People.  The couple, who met in November 2016 at Victor Cruz\\'s birthday party, got engaged in December and announced the happy news today on Instagram.  \"A night full of tears of happiness I’m beyond excited to spend the rest of my life with you @sterl_shep3 you are my soulmate, my best friend, my everything!

The couple\\'s A-list guest list reportedly included Chrissy Teigen, Gabrielle Union, Odell Beckham Jr., Shanina Shaik, Joan Smalls and bridesmaid/fellow model Jourdan Dunn.  Chanel wore a stunning Zuhair Murad wedding gown with a cape on her big day, which celebrity stylist Anita Patrickson helped her secure.  \"I never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding,\" Iman told Brides.com. \"But the moment we put it on, we all loved it! It was so chic and unusual but also felt a little vintage.\"  The model changed dresses for the reception, donning a second Zuhair Murad gown, this one with a deep V-neck and pink tones to match the wedding\\'s rose gold theme.  \"I wanted to keep it as classic as possible,\" she said. \"I wanted a design that I can look back on in 20 years and not be wondering what I was thinking!\"  Iman and Shepard worked with wedding planner Mindy Weiss, one of BAZAAR\\'s top planners, for their Los Angeles affair.

       " \"TLC has officially severed its ties with former “Counting On” star Derick Dillard after he repeatedly made negative comments about one of the network’s other stars, Jazz Jennings.  On Saturday, the network released a statement on Twitter explaining that it has severed ties with Dillard after another round of comments against Jennings, who stars on her own series, “I Am Jazz,” which chronicles her life following her decision at a young age to transition from a male to a female.  “We want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in ‘Counting On’ for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick’s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,” the statement reads. “TLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.”  The decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn’t believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.  “I pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It’s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what’s on tv these days,” he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.  As previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is “ordained by God.”  “What an oxymoron… a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it’s ordained by God.”  Jennings, who hasn’t directly responded to Dillard’s latest comments, said at the time:  “Every day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.”  Dillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he’s just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity. However, people on Twitter were mostly unimpressed with his justification, and it was enough to prompt the network to completely sever ties with him.\",\n",

       " 'Carrie Underwood posted a hilarious video of her husband, hockey player Mike Fisher, trying to sing to her new hit single \"Cry Pretty\" Saturday.  While driving around, Fisher did his best to hit the same notes his wife hits in the song, but failed spectacularly. \"No, no, no, no, no, nononono noooooo,\" he wails behind the wheel.  \"You going to start your new career as a country singer, babe?\" Underwood asks from the passenger seat.  \"I\\'ve heard that many times,\" Fisher says before going back to singing \"Nooooo.\"  There was at least one person in the car who appreciated the scene. Their son, Isaiah Michael Fisher, is heard laughing hysterically in the background.  \"Sounds just like the original,\" Underwood wrote in the caption, adding a zany face emoji.  Fans loved the funny video, especially Isiah\\'s laughing in the back.  \"Hahaha. Too funny. The giggling from backseat is priceless,\" one wrote.  \"Love hearing that sweet giggle,\" added another.

The song was written with The Love Junkies, made up of Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna and Liz Rose.  \"The first single is a song I love so much and can’t wait to share with you,\" Underwood said in a statement in April. \"The title refers to when emotions take over and you just can’t hold them back.

Australia (via the Daily Mail), the young pair have parted ways due to their inability to agree about when to start a family.  An insider apparently told the magazine that 28 year-old Hemsworth wished to have children, whilst 25 year-old Cyrus was not ready, ‘He wants kids and doesn't want to keep putting it off but it's not quite the timeline Miley had in mind.’  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  The source claimed the Hannah Montana star was hesitant to tie the knot at all, ‘Miley put off plans for the wedding and Liam was growing tired of it... They haven't been getting along in recent months.’  The insider added, ‘[She] didn't really want to get married. It's something that everyone else seemed to get but Liam. [His] family had been begging him to see the light for a long time, but he had faith in Miley. Now he feels like an idiot.’  This news comes days after the ‘Wrecking Ball’ singer deleted all posts on her Instagram.  Hemsworth, however, still has all his posts, including those which feature the singer-actress.  Instagram  The Hunger Games star met Cyrus on the set of the 2009 film The Last Song and they subsequently began dating. First engaged in 2012, the pair tragically broke it off just the following year. After an almost four year hiatus, the pair recoupled in 2016.  In September of last year, however, Cyrus told the Sun that she had no plans to marry any time soon, explaining, ‘I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more, I have too much living to do [before I get married].'  She continued, 'Three years ago, if you’d asked me if I’d be here, this happy with this man, I’d have been stunned. I’m just riding this out. In some relationships, you lose yourself by being with someone else. Actually, it made me find myself more. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it’s possible to get even happier, I’ll take it.’  Getty Images  Despite these statements, rumours of a secret marriage swirled. Though, it appears they were just that, rumours.  Well this is just terrible news isn't it?\",\n",
       " 'In the absence of one Donald Trump , who hosted a rally for himself in Michigan in lieu of attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner Saturday night, the MC and comedian Michelle Wolf declined to, as they say, take any prisoners. “Like a porn star says when she’s about to have sex with Trump, let’s get this over with,” Wolf said, opening her remarks. It was the president’s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents’ Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN’s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981—then recovering from an attempted assassination.)  Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents’ Dinner—for, it seems, they weren’t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally—as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe ’s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast—but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf’s jokes about Trump’s wealth (“Mr. President, I don’t think you’re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you’re doing fine”) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf’s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: “I loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid’s Tale ,” Wolf said to her. “I’m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what’s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.”  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders’s seeming gameness for taking the criticism—“That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,” she wrote on Twitter—a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents’ Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf’s speech), said, “Washington is so thin-skinned .” (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O’Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf’s performance—though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf\\'s own, in response to Sean Spicer\\'s tweet that \"Tonight\\'s #WHCD was a disgrace.\" \"Thank you!\" she responded.  Also, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn’t have water.',\n",

Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.

       " 'Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.  Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape. The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.  Cohen — who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring \"both triggering and emotionally exhausting\") — alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during \"a dark time in my life.\" Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with \"the aftermath of the rape.\"  Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen\\'s account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, \"I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.\"  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick\\'s home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor\\'s home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when \"Ed suggested \\'we should all fuck.\\'\" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling \"to smooth everything over\" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  \"I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,\" Cohen alleges. \"I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.\"  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. \"I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,\" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her \"I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed \\'raped\\' me and that I don’t want to be \\'that girl.\\'\"  Cohen continued that she now realizes \"the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others.\" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  \"There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,\" Cohen told THR. \"I think that\\'s what I\\'m contributing to. That\\'s the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.\"  THR has reached out to Westwick for additional comment, as well as to Cohen for a response to Westwick\\'s assertion.',\n",

Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.

Amplifying students such as Emma González has injected optimism among liberal activists in the grinding debate about the role of guns in society.[How the Parkland teens became villains on the right-wing Internet]González, 18, has been at the flash point of this dynamic, appearing in newspapers, on magazine covers and in a prominent spot at the anchor rally in Washington, where her speech, which included a prolonged silence, lasted as long as the six minutes it took a gunman at her high school in Parkland, Fla., to kill 17 people on Valentine’s Day.Gun-control advocates have held up González as a figurehead of the movement, splashing her trademark shaved head on T-shirts and viral images.Then, there is another viewpoint of her activism.A doctored animation of González tearing the U.S. Constitution in half circulated on social media during the rally, after it was lifted from a Teen Vogue story about teenage activists. In the real image, González is ripping apart a gun-range target.[NRA host taunts Parkland teens: ‘No one would know your names’ if classmates were still alive]The doctored image mushrooming across social media appeared to confirm the belief among Second Amendment absolutists that calls for stricter gun-control measures are transgressive, destroying the very foundation of the United States.The animation bounced around conservative Twitter before it received a signal boost Saturday from actor Adam Baldwin.He tweeted to a quarter of a million followers with a hashtag reading “#Vorwärts!” — the German word for “forward” and an apparent reference to the Hitler Youth, whose march song included the word.Not gonna happen. pic.twitter.com/4kKBcSqdCl — Gab: Free Speech Social Network (@getongab) March 24, 2018Gab, the Twitter-like social network that is a popular refuge for the alt-right, tweeted the animation on Saturday to more than 100,000 followers, then hours later asserted it was “satire.” It racked up more than 1,200 retweets. The still images, looking more sophisticated than the glitchy animation, went further, appearing to be taken as legitimate by some conservative-minded Twitter users.The pushback seems to have gained more traction than the original images, although that means the original images are also spread wider.Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, debunked the altered image, saying in a tweet: “Just a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right),” referencing a user named “Linda NRA Supporter” who posted the photo and whose account has since been suspended.Justy a sample of what NRA supporters are doing to teenagers who survived a massacre (real picture on the right). pic.twitter.com/czX7IHD8ur — Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) March 25, 2018Moynihan’s tweet keyed on an idea: Public moments by the Parkland students are being scrutinized and stretched to either bolster or tear down arguments on social media, built on the traditional debates made around the dinner table.Generally, one form of criticism of González and fellow students such as David Hogg, 17, has focused on their ages.They are too naive and young to grasp the extent of how money, politics and policy intersect, the argument goes. It was cemented in the right’s criticism of Hogg’s insistence that clear backpacks would infringe on civil rights.The online effort to defuse Hogg has paid off. The first “top news” video that appears in a YouTube search for “David Hogg” is a takedown from conservative outlet the Blaze. “It’s hard to not just go after this kid,” host Pat Gray said in the video published Saturday, describing Hogg.[How conspiracy theories about the Parkland attack enter the mainstream]Other elements of González have been used in an attempt to discredit her, online and off.For instance, some in conservative circles have circulated images calling attention to a Cuban flag sewn to her jacket.“Emma Gonzales, wearing the flag of an authoritarian communist nation. Makes sense, they both hate an armed citizenry,” one meme shared on Reddit’s conservative page r/TheDonald. It was shared on social media through variations of the theme, including one by conservative commentator Andrew Wilkow. González’s father migrated from Cuba to the United States.As The Post’s Samantha Schmidt reported, the flag came under attack Sunday from the campaign of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self defense,” said a post on King’s campaign page on Facebook. The post also included a photo of González at the podium Saturday.A self-identified conservative Parkland student also has been buttressed by the right, which thinks he identifies with its politics — a de facto foil to his classmates. Kyle Kashuv, 16, visited President Trump and five Republican U.S. senators just three weeks after the killings to offer alternatives in the debate.“The initial movement, in its purest form, was amazing. It got corrupted because now it’s represented as anti-gun and anti-NRA. ‘Boycott this, boycott that.’ It’s detracting from the actual discussions,” Kashuv told The Post’s Dan Zak about the work of his classmates.Since then, Kashuv has been an occasional guest on Fox News Channel, sometimes calling for middle ground with fellow classmates and among those who disagree in the debate. Kashuv has echoed critics on the right that a focus on law-enforcement failures, not gun laws, is the way forward.But he has also targeted his classmates on the conservative media circuit.Hogg’s comments at the rally were “egregious and inflammatory,” Kashuv said on Fox News on Saturday, and he has criticized Hogg numerous times on Twitter. On Sunday, Kashuv challenged classmate Cameron Kasky to a debate. His argument has been bolstered by the NRA, which has published videos decrying Hogg’s use of explicit language and suggesting his activist peers would be unknown if their classmates were still alive, saved by a gun-carrying officer.Conservatives, who have often asserted that high school students have limited understanding and legitimacy in the gun debate, have taken a shine to the Parkland student.“You will include Kyle Kashuv in your story, yes?” Baldwin asked The Post in a direct message on Twitter.Abby Ohlheiser contributed to this report, which has been updated.Read more:Rep.

       " \"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They’ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions… They don’t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He’s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he’s come out a better person, and he’s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie’s plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don’t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they’re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there’s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It’ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection.

Knight, who was a finalist on the popular competition show \\'Project Runway,\\' has died at age 39. (Photo: Brian Bohannon, AP)  Georgia fashion designer Mychael Knight, who was a finalist on the popular TV competition show Project Runway, died Tuesday at age 39.  Knight died outside Atlanta surrounded by family and friends, said friend Jerris Madison, the editor and photographer of Obvious Magazine, a fashion, lifestyle and cultural publication.  An official cause of death has not been released, but Knight had extensively shared his five-year struggles with irritable bowel syndrome, writing in now-deleted Facebook posts that he suffered chronic abdominal pain, a \"leaky gut,\" extreme fatigue and exhaustion.  \"He was innovative, unapologetic, kind and giving,\" Madison said of Knight. \"He made sure that anybody who was in his core circle, his family, his friends, didn\\'t have to want for anything. He was just an amazing man.\"  Knight appeared on Season 3 of Project Runway, which aired on Bravo, finishing fourth that year. He returned for Project Runway All-Stars, finishing eighth on the show that now airs on the Lifetime network.  \"We are saddened to hear about the passing of a member of the Project Runway family,\" said Lifetime spokeswoman Dee Perez in a statement. \"It\\'s a loss of a great talent and we wish his family peace and solace during this difficult time.\"  Knight spent his childhood in Montgomery, Alabama, but graduated from Washingtonville Senior High School in Washingtonville, New York, in 1996. Later that same year, he began his freshman year of college at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia. In 2001, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in apparel design and merchandising.  After completing his undergraduate studies, Knight broke into the fashion industry in Atlanta by working as an intern at Wilbourn Exclusives in 2001 before becoming a fashion stylist in the music industry in 2002.  In 2006, Knight became a contestant for Project Runway, and went on to win that season\\'s fan favorite award. The next year, he introduced his label, Mychael Knight, on BET\\'s Rip the Runway and he designed a line of custom tees for the Starbucks Corp.  In 2008, Knight launched Kitty & Dick, his lingerie label for men and women, and his unisex fragrance, MajK.  Madison said Project Runway definitely helped expand Knight\\'s brand, which caught the eye of celebrities like Toni Braxton, Sheri Shepard and Eva Marcille, who ultimately became his clients.  \"His name was still on people\\'s minds,\" Madison said. \"The industry is very competitive, but he continued to do it his way.\"  Madison said Knight, who had been living in Los Angeles, was always sharp and chic in his personal style and that carried over into his collections.  \"He died doing what he loved,\" Madison said. \"And you can see that in his final collection presented (last month) at New York Fashion Week. It was amazing. The industry has lost a true innovator. Mychael was just getting to that point where people were saying \\'Hey, I remember this guy.\\' He was about to be huge and really wanted to capitalize on affordable sportswear for women of all sizes.\"  In addition to his parents, Michael Sr. and Pamela Knight, Knight is survived by two sisters.  \"Mychael meant everything to us and we loved him dearly. He was generous and so full of life. This is how we choose to remember his legacy,\" the family said in a statement.  Funeral arrangements were pending.

       " 'Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok.

       " 'Off the market! Colin Jost was not too shy to let the world know that he’s taken while appearing on live television.  The comedian, 35, who has been dating Scarlett Johansson, revealed that he has a girlfriend during his “Weekend Update” segment of Saturday Night Live on Saturday, May 5. Leslie Jones stopped by to talk about Facebook’s new dating feature and went through a list of the “terrible men” she’s dated and shared why the relationships didn’t work.  At the end of the clip, she showed a photo of Jost, saying: “Colin, he was so cute and sweet and kind but it would never work because he’s gay.”  “I’m not gay!” Jost responded with a laugh. “I told you I have a girlfriend!”  “And I have told you that I am not acknowledging that bitch! You either prove that you are not gay or I’m going to keep telling everybody that you are,” Jones responded.  Johansson, 33, also made a surprise appearance at the beginning of the show on Saturday, starring as Ivanka Trump during the cold open.  The actress and the funnyman have not openly discussed their relationship, but they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of her movie Avengers: Infinity War in L.A. on April 23. They previously made their first appearance together at the American Museum of Natural History Gala in November 2017. The pair didn’t walk the red carpet at the event but posed for photos with each other inside.  They first sparked romance rumors when they were spotted getting cozy at an SNL afterparty for the show’s season 42 finale in May 2017. The duo then spent July 4 weekend in Montauk, New York, and were spotted kissing after leaving a restaurant in NYC in November 2017.  “Scarlett and Colin looked very happy together,” an eyewitness told Us Weekly at the time. “He was very protective over her as they were leaving. He tried blocking her from the photographers and the rain at the same time as they left.”  Last year an insider told Us that Jost “wants to marry” the Ghost in the Shell actress. “He loves to take her out and show her off,” the source said. “He’s head over heels.”  As previously reported, Johansson filed for divorce from ex-husband Romain Dauriac in March 2017. The actress and Dauriac share daughter Rose, 2. Prior to that relationship, she was married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.

       " \"Warning: This post contains major spoilers about Wednesday’s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.  Brooke Shields has about a hundred film and TV credits, as well as two Golden Globe nominations and an iconic Calvin Klein commercial, on her resumé. Still, on her first day working alongside friend Mariska Hargitay on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, “I was so nervous to come into this well-oiled machine that I called her my character’s name,” Shields said, laughing.  She’s referring to the scene that ended this week’s episode of the NBC procedural: Olivia, who at the top of the episode was relieved to hear that her child-abuse investigation had been closed, answers a knock at her apartment door to find Shields standing on the other side. “Olivia Benson?” the woman says, “I’m Sheila Porter, Noah’s grandmother.”  Fans of the series know this is not great for Lt. Benson, who adopted her son, Noah, after his mother Ellie died. And as Liv reminded Trevor Langan in Wednesday’s hour, Ellie had told Olivia that both of her parents were dead.  Turns out, Ellie lied. And now that Sheila is making moves to vacate Noah’s adoption, expect to see a lot more of Shields’ character in the coming weeks.  Shields told reporters at a recent press event that she’s very aware of how Olivia’s enemies are viewed by SVU diehards. “But I think what fans will understand is that both of these woman actually have a valid argument, and what does that mean? It is about winning? Is it about finding the healthiest compromise?” she asked. “I’m not there to replace [Olivia]. I’m not there to undermine or stamp her out, so I’m not an adversary in that way.”  New showrunner Michael Chernuchin credits Hargitay with thinking of Shields for the part, an idea that came up after Hargitay saw Shields act in an episode of mutual pal Ali Wentworth’s Pop comedy Nightcap.  “I sit at the screening, and I’m like, ‘Oh my god, she’s perfect!” Hargitay recalls. Getting the Suddenly Susan alum on board, however, took some creative pitching. “She’s like, ‘So what am I playing?,’ and I’m like, ‘the grandma,'” Hargitay says, laughing. “She goes, ‘I see how you are.'”  Chernuchin adds, “On the Internet, when we announced that she was going to be on the show, we wouldn’t say what part she was playing. Everybody was guessing different things. Nobody guessed this.”\",\n",
       " \"For the Iraqi minister, see Mohammed Hadid  Mohamed Anwar Hadid (Arabic: محمد حديد\\u200e; born 6 November[5] 1948)[6] is a Jordanian-American real estate developer of Palestinian origin. He is known for building luxury hotels and mansions, mainly in the Bel Air neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles County, California.  Early life  Mohamed Anwar Hadid is a Palestinian[7][8][9][10][11] born in Nazareth[1] in November 1948, to a Muslim family. He is the son of Anwar Hadid (c. 1908 – 1979) and his wife Khairiah.[12] Through his mother he claims descent from Daher Al Omer, Prince of Nazareth and the Sheik of Galilee.[13][14] Hadid has two brothers and five sisters.[12]  His father, Anwar Hadid studied at a Jerusalem teachers' college and attended a university[which?] in Syria to study law, before working in land settlement for the British authorities and teaching English at a teachers' college in Mandatory Palestine. In 1948, he moved to Syria and joined the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America. He and his family lived in Damascus, Tunisia, and Greece before moving to Washington D.C., as Anwar had a job at the VOA headquarters there, when Mohamed was 14, and spent the rest of his career there with VOA and USIA as a writer, editor and translator.[12][13][15]  Hadid attended North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[1]  Career  Among his early ventures was a company that exported equipment to the Middle East.[6][16] He started his career restoring and reselling classic cars in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., before moving to Greece where he opened a nightclub on an island, and with the profits, started developing real estate back in the United States.[17]  In the 1980s, much of his financial clout came from the SAAR Foundation, a Herndon-based foundation with Saudi roots. The foundation was a 50-50 partner in many of Hadid's ventures.[16] In the late 1980s, he faced at least 30 lawsuits from creditors and banks claiming he had not fulfilled various financial obligations.[18] He paid $150 million for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and New York. He also converted a Houston hotel into a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and developed a Ritz-Carlton resort in Scottsdale, Arizona. He outmaneuvered Donald Trump, paid $42.9 million for several choice parcels in Aspen and announced plans for a 292-room Ritz resort.[16][18]  In 1992, a settlement was reached in a lawsuit by Riggs Bank against Columbia First Bank Chairman Melvin Lenkin, a Hadid partner in a Washington, D.C., construction project that involved a loan on which Hadid defaulted. Following the settlement Hadid closed his local office, lost his McLean home to foreclosure, and left the Washington area.[19]  He developed Le Belvedere, a mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles,[20] that sold for $50 million in 2010. In 2012, he developed The Crescent Palace, a 48,000-square-foot home on an acre plot next door to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he listed for sale at $58 million.[21]  Shortly after Hadid received approval for the construction of a mansion in Bel Air, the Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose it.[20] In January 2015, Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Hadid.[22] Laurie accused Hadid of damaging the roots of a eucalyptus tree on her property with a retaining wall he built next to her house.[22]  In December 2015, the Los Angeles city council voted to pursue criminal charges over a claim that Hadid violated local zoning laws. The council alleged he built his house contrary to multiple planning orders and made it twice the permitted size.[23][24] In May 2017, Hadid pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges stemming from mansion-construction issues for which he did not receive city approval, and was sentenced that July to community service and fines.[25][26]  In July 2017, he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, summoned to return $14,191 to the City of Los Angeles in damages, and fined $3,000.[27] He was also given a three-year probation period to ensure the property would comply with existing regulations, or he would face a 180-day jail sentence.[27]  Athletic career  Hadid competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics, representing Jordan. He was 43 years old at the time. Hadid was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber. Hadid was the only member of the Jordanian delegation,[1] and remains the only person to have represented Jordan in the Winter Olympics.[28][29]  Television appearances  Hadid has appeared on the TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid.[21] He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset.,[20] and Second Wives Club on E! with his fiancée Shiva Safai in 2017[30].  Personal life  His first wife was Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid. He and Butler ended their marriage in 1992.[31][32]  From 1994 until their divorce in 2000, he was married to the Dutch model Yolanda Hadid, née Van den Herik.[33] They had three children, who all became models: Gigi (born 1995), Bella (born 1996),[32] and Anwar (born 1999).[34]  As of 2014, Hadid is engaged to Shiva Safai, a model and businesswoman. She was born in Iran and raised in Norway, and at age 19, moved to Los Angeles with her family.[35]  Hadid is a dual Jordanian-American citizen.[1] He does not consider himself a devout Muslim,[14] but has never drunk alcohol, although he does have a 5,000-bottle wine cellar, including some from his own Beverly Hills winery.[17]  In 2017, his fiancée, Shiva Safai, who is 33 years his junior, began to appear in E! reality show, Second Wives Club.[36][37]  References  Official website\",\n",

Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). “I don’t see hallucinations, it’s just a flash of something in my head,” says Day, who’s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. “I’m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There’s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.”  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? “She’s very open and loving,” says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. “I had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,” recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. “Laura’s information saved Zoe’s life,” says Arquette. “It was intense.”  Day’s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn’t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore—or “Aunt Demi,” as she’s known to Samson—worked with Day on the set of 199l’s The Butcher’s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. “Laura has given me a trust in my own intuition,” says the actress, who won’t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day’s intervention. “I took a greater position of responsibility,” says Moore. “Laura put me back in the driver’s seat.”  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. “I wanted her to live,” says Day, “and I needed to know what to do.” She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian’s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. “At the point when you’re most lost,” says Day, “that’s when intuition kicks in.”  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success—she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate—allows her to “do bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.” A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. “People are drawn to Laura,” says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day’s boyfriend of three years. “She makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.”  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. “I don’t want my environment perfect,” she says. “I work very hard to live in the moment. I’m interested in how I’m feeling right now.”  ALEX TRESNIOWSKI    DEBBIE SEAMAN in New York City',\n",

       " 'As the focus of this year’s Comedy Central Roast, Bruce Willis was hit with repeated jabs about his age, his marriage, his Planet Hollywood business venture, his side music career and his recent string of less-than-spectacular films — and most of them came from the surprise appearance of ex-wife Demi Moore.  Saying that she was “married to Bruce for the first three ‘Die Hard’ movies, which makes sense because the last two sucked,” Moore served as an impromptu roaster as she recounted memories of raising their three daughters, who were also in attendance, together.  “People wonder why our marriage came to an end, and in all honesty I think it was because some jealousy started to creep in. I think Bruce never really got over the fact that I rocked the bald look better than he did,” Moore joked. “After our divorce, he said he considered the end of our marriage his biggest failure, but Bruce, don’t be so hard on yourself, you’ve had much bigger failures. I mean Planet Hollywood, ‘Hudson Hawk,’ ‘Striking Distance,’ campaigning for Michael Dukakis, turning down Clooney’s role in ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ to focus on playing the harmonica?”  On a more sentimental note, the actress, who was married to Willis for 12 years, said their marriage included “some of the best times of my life,” praising him as “easily one of my top three husbands.” After the roast, Willis told reporters her performance was “terrific…very surprising and very cool,” and he was just as shocked as the audience about her appearance.  The roast, recorded Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, was led by Roast Master Joseph Gordon-Levitt, along with an assorted group of roasters, including Edward Norton, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Ross, Martha Stewart, Lil Rel Howery, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Pollak, Nikki Glaser and Dom Irrera. Although still packed with burns on Willis and jokes against Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein, the roast was more gentle and loving than most, with essentially all of the participants speaking on what the actor has meant to them.  Gordon-Levitt, who played a younger version of Willis in their film “Looper,” told Variety that Willis asked him personally to host, and when prepping the material he “worked with the writers and said yes sometimes, said no a lot more.”  “I was like ‘That’s not funny, that’s not funny, that’s not funny, that’s pretty funny.’ We’re just trying to make each other laugh, I actually think that there’s something cool about being able to laugh at yourself, not take things too seriously and I think it can be sort of cathartic,” Gordon-Levitt said.  Norton and Shepherd walked away as the big winners of the night, with Norton’s bit focusing on how his and Willis’ careers have differed, questioning, “You get away with everything. Can I cock my eye and say some cryptic s— that literally not one person in the room understands and have everyone laugh their asses off? I cannot.”  After continually trying to understand Willis’ success (joking it was somehow in spite of poor scripts and repeatedly doing the same type of film), Norton reflected on working with him on a recent movie, saying, “I love you, or maybe I’m a very good actor and I’m just acting when I say that. You wouldn’t know the difference, and that’s the reason I love you.”  Shepherd, who starred alongside “Moonlighting” with Willis and infamously fought with the actor on the project, said she hadn’t spoken to him in three decades but still agreed to be a roaster.  “Our characters on ‘Moonlighting’ weren’t much of a stretch,” she said. “I played a former model, which I was, and he played an a–hole, which he is… I know we haven’t had a conversation in 30 years but we’ll always have something more important: residuals.”  Rodman, who attempted a pro-North Korea joke, was booed on stage, and Ross, who is also a co-executive producer on the show, arrived at the event dressed as Kim Jong-Un.  After the taping, Ross said he “felt like this was a classier roast than we normally do. I thought it was pretty classy, he’s a movie star we classed it up with tuxedos and Martha Stewart.”  When it came for his time to speak on stage, Willis said, “If you’re a fan of Bruce Willis movies and I know you are, then you know how this works. I get the s— beat out of me for about an hour and a half, and then at the end I come back and whip everybody’s a–,” proceeding to roast his roasters.  He ended by clarifying why he subjected himself to be the subject of a roast, which he said was to settle something once and for all: “‘Die Hard’ is not a Christmas movie. It’s a god damn Bruce Willis movie!”  Following the event, Willis teased that he “thought I dislocated my jaw because I was laughing so hard.”  Bruce Willis closes out #BruceWillisRoast with a harmonica solo pic.twitter.com/BrzPQM0dhk — Kirsten Chuba (@KirstenChuba) July 15, 2018  The “Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis” airs on the network July 29 at 10 p.m.',\n",
       " 'We love all the Disney Princesses, but we\\'re all about Girl Power and some princesses are just more badass than others. On the power girl scale, here\\'s how your fave Disney Princesses rank.  13. Aurora, Sleeping Beauty  The most interesting thing about her is that she sleeps, for a really long time! The story\\'s a bit of a snooze, literally.  12. Snow White, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  Snow White started the whole \"I\\'ll just rest my eyes until prince charming comes along\" trend, which just prevents her, and the other damsels in distress, from living up to their full potential. Plus, lying around waiting for some dude to come rescue you? Lame! At least she taught us to never take food from strangers.  11. Cinderella, Cinderella  From her evil stepsisters to her even more evil stepmother, Cinderella just can\\'t seem to catch a break. We sympathize with Cinders, but we wouldn\\'t have blamed her for teaching her evil step siblings a lesson or two!  10. Ariel, Little Mermaid  While we love Ariel\\'s adventurous side, does it not bother anyone else how much she was willing to give up for Prince Eric? Meanwhile, he was ready to marry the first girl who sang him a pretty tune. It\\'s time to reevaluate your life when the crab makes better decisions than you do!  9. Jasmine, Aladdin  Our favorite thing about Jasmine is that her and Aladdin take turns rescuing each other. Still, girl can be super judge-y. We respect that she isn\\'t \"a prize to be won,\" but she doesn\\'t give anyone a chance because she thinks all the princes are show-offs—until someone shows up on a magic carpet, which sounds a little show off-y to us...  8. Merida, Brave  Merida gets props for wanting to do things her own way, and her bow and arrow skills give us a total Katniss vibe. Okay, so she did turn her mom into a bear and all, but she realized she was wrong and changed her back. That counts for something, right?  7. Elsa, Frozen  Elsa\\'s the only other Disney princess (then queen) that has magical powers. Unfortunately, it takes her almost hurting her own sister to realize that being different can be good thing.  6. Rapunzel, Tangled  Rapunzle spends the first 18 years of her life locked in a castle, and yet she still learned how to wield a weapon (a frying pan, but hey, it still counts!) like a trained professional.  5. Belle, Beauty and the Beast  Belle is a small town girl who loves nothing more than to curl up with a good book. While she doesn\\'t have magic powers or serious fighting skills like some of the other princesses, she manages to show the beast there\\'s beauty in kindness. And unlike some of the other damsels on this list, she rescues her prince from an evil spell!  4. Pocahontas, Pocahontas  Yes, she made a sacrifice for love, but it was deeper than that. Pocahontas managed to create peace and understanding between two feuding groups. Plus, she can paint with all the colors of the wind, so there\\'s that.  3. Tiana, The Princess and the Frog  Tiana is the first and only princess who not only has a full-time job, but starts her own business, too! She proves that with hard work and determination, nothing, even turning into a frog, can stand in your way.  2. Anna, Frozen  Anna is goofy, outspoken, unstoppable and totally relatable. When everyone feared the worst, Anna looked for a solution, and proved that sometimes the most important love is the love for your family.  1. Mulan, Mulan  Mulan is no one\\'s damsel in distress, which makes her the most kick-butt princess of them all. She joins the army and no one finds her suspicious, because she\\'s just as good, if not better, than everyone else. Oh yeah, she also saves her entire country. NBD.

       " 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Elizabeth Chuck  A woman convicted for her role in the abduction of Elizabeth Smart, who was held captive for nine months when she was 14 years old, was released from prison on Wednesday.  The Utah Department of Corrections said just after 8 a.m. local time that Wanda Barzee, 72, had been freed from Utah State Prison. A gaggle of reporters and news cameras arrived early Wednesday to stake out prison exits in anticipation of her leaving, but Barzee was not immediately spotted.  Minutes after Barzee\\'s release, Smart thanked supporters in an Instagram post, and said she was determined to continue living her life despite her captor being free.  \"May we all remain vigilant in watching over our families, friends, and community from anyone who would seek to hurt or take advantage. I truly believe life is meant to be happy and beautiful, and no matter what happens that will remain my goal for me and for my family,\" she wrote.  In a press conference later Wednesday morning, Barzee\\'s attorney, Scott Williams, said Barzee didn\\'t pose any threat by being out of prison.  \"There is no credible evidence that she is a danger to the community,\" Williams said.  Williams did not answer questions about where Barzee will live or whether she has a support system. He expressed confidence that she could live in society without any problems, but said her biggest challenge, \"obviously, is the high-profile nature\" of the case.  Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from the Salt Lake City bedroom she shared with her younger sister in a case that drew international headlines. After intense media attention surrounding Smart\\'s disappearance, Smart was seen walking the streets of a Salt Lake City suburb with Brian David Mitchell, a street pastor, and Barzee, his wife.  The couple was arrested and charged in her kidnapping, which Smart has said included repeated sexual assaults by Mitchell. During the attacks, Barzee would sit next to Smart and \"encourage her husband to continue to rape me,\" Smart recalled during a press conference last week.  Mitchell, who prior to the abduction had done odd jobs around the Smart family household, is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee was convicted of state and federal crimes, and in 2010 was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for her role in the abduction.  Elizabeth Smart arrives for a news conference Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018, in Salt Lake City. Smart says it appears there is no viable, legal recourse she can take to stop the release of one of her kidnappers. Rick Bowmer / AP  She received credit for time already served and in 2016, Barzee was released from federal prison but still faced one to 15 years in state prison for a separate attempted abduction of Smart\\'s cousin. In June, her attorney asked that Barzee get credit toward her state sentence for the time she spent in federal credit, but the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied that request — and set Barzee\\'s sentence to go until 2024.  That changed last Tuesday when the parole board announced that Barzee would be released on Sept. 19 — an unexpected move that even caught Smart, who described it as a \"big shock,\" by surprise.  \"I do believe she’s a threat,\" Smart said of Barzee during last week\\'s press conference. \"For me, I know the depth of her depravity.\"  The parole board said that after a legal review of Barzee\\'s time served, it discovered that part of the time she spent in federal prison should in fact count toward her state sentence, making her eligible for release.  Barzee will be under federal supervision for five years. Smart\\'s attorney, Brett Tolman, told the Associated Press that conditions of Barzee\\'s release include mental health treatment and an order not to contact Smart\\'s family.  Upon her release, Barzee also voluntarily agreed to not go to any geographic locations that the Smart family might frequent, Williams, her attorney, said. Violating any of those conditions could result in her return to prison, although Williams was not able to say for how long, adding that it would depend on which condition had been violated.  Smart, now 30, has said the couple kept her chained down in makeshift campsites during her abduction — including, at first, one in the foothills just miles from her house. She told reporters last week that she believes in forgiveness as a Christian, but does not believe Barzee has been rehabilitated to the point where she should be freed.  Smart has since become an outspoken advocate against child abduction and sexual violence. Now married and pregnant with her third child, Smart said in an Instagram post last week that she is taking precautions to protect her family but refuses \"to live in fear.\"  \"I lived in absolute fear and terror for nine months, no matter the outcome I will not do so again,\" she wrote.',\n",

       " 'Nikki Bella may insist she\\'s \"just friends\" with ex-fiance John Cena, but the Total Bellas star has found her second perfect wedding dress.  In a new sneak peek from Sunday\\'s all new Total Bellas, the former WWE star is ready to tie the knot to Cena when she finds her perfect dress, after the engagement already led to a previous breakup.  \"Oh my gosh, I just got goosebumps,\" Brie Bella tells her twin sister as she steps out in the precious gown in the video. \"It\\'s stunning. I feel like this is exactly what you\\'ve been looking for.\"  \"I love this,\" Nikki gushes while admiring herself in the mirror. \"I feel like a Barbie! I think this is it. Yes!\"  While talking to the camera as part of the show, TooFab reports, Brie suggests her sister has decided on the dress before she even admitted it to her friends.  \"You always know when a bride finds her dress, because when they walk out and it\\'s like this big smile and they feel like a queen,\" Brie said. \"You\\'re just like, \\'That\\'s it, that\\'s the smile I\\'ve been looking for lately.\\' And I just feel like now we\\'ve just made a turn, things are going to start feeling really special, like, \\'Hey, I\\'m getting married.\\'\"  The video, and bittersweet moment, comes days after Nikki set the record straight on the state of her relationship with Cena in a new YouTube video.  \"Right now, we\\'re just friends,\" she said. \"We are both working on each other and trying to work on us. We talk every day. He is not only my best friend, he is truly one of the most amazing people I\\'ve ever met, and he has patience with me, and he has really taught me a lot over the past few months. I think one of those things is an inner strength that I thought I had but didn\\'t realize how strong I had it.\"  She did add, however, \"I do have hope for us.\"  The couple officially called off their engagement back in April, weeks away from their wedding day, after Cena was seemingly unwilling to have kids. However, after the WWE superstar agreed to reverse his vasectomy and have children with Nikki, she still faced some concerns about the big day.  \"This is forever, and I don\\'t want to be someone who has a divorce or who has kids and then gets a divorce,\" Bella explained. \"I want to walk down that aisle and give my vows and have this be one time.\"  The reality star also admitted that reliving her toughest breakup on screen every week has been tough, also confusing fans on the status of their relationship.  \"I have to say, it\\'s extremely hard to relive every week, because I think all of us have been through breakups, but to go through a breakup that\\'s so public, and then have to relive it on a reality show makes it super tough,\" she admitted.  Hopefully there\\'s a good chance they\\'ll find their footing sooner rather than later.  \"Hopefully one day we\\'ll get back together, and if we don\\'t, we both want each other to be very, very happy,\" she concluded.

Heading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for “That’s What I Like.”  Related 3 reasons why the 2018 Grammys fell so flat  Mars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.

Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for “That’s What I Like.”  Another big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for “HUMBLE” during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.

       " 'Michael Bublé and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are expecting their third child, Us Weekly can confirm.  The singer’s rep confirmed the good news and according to reports in Lopilato’s native Argentina, the actress, 30, is about two and a half months along in her pregnancy.  The happy news comes after a heartbreaking year that saw the couple’s eldest son, Noah, 4, battle cancer. He was diagnosed with liver cancer in November 2016 and the singer, 42, and his wife put their careers on hold while their little boy underwent treatment. (The pair also share a second son, Elias, 2.)  A source told Us in December 2017 that Noah is “doing well” now and “Michael is ready to think about going back to work.”  But the source added that the couple’s focus remains on their family. “This difficult time has brought them closer together and put things in perspective,” the source said. “Michael is keeping his workload light so he can spend as much time as possible” with his wife and sons.  The “Feeling Good” singer gave an update about Noah’s condition to Us last February. “We are so grateful to report that our son Noah has been progressing well during his treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future for our little boy,” Bublé told Us at the time. “He has been brave throughout and we continue to be inspired by his courage.”  Lopilato opened up about Noah’s health and the impact it had on their family in an interview on Argentinian TV last July.  “These things, when they happen to you in life, they make you realize that the most important thing isn’t what you thought it was — it’s to have faith, to be strong,” she told TV host Susana Giminez. “There were nights I couldn’t sleep, that I prayed to God, because it’s a long process. But thank God the worst is over.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

       " 'It’s time to uncork the bubbly! Jedediah Bila and her fiancé, Jeremy Scher, are married, Us Weekly can confirm.  Celebrity Weddings of 2018  The 39-year-old former View cohost and her love tied the knot in Huntington, New York, on Saturday, February 17.  “As 60 of their closest family and friends filled the room, Jedediah walked down the aisle as Jeremy beamed with joy — you could truly feel the love in this magical evening!” wedding planner Michael Russo tells Us.  The glowing bride opened up to Us and shared exclusive details of the happy couple’s fairytale wedding. “I’m super excited. Super, super excited,” Bila told Us. “I always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it’s crazy.”  The star, who donned a Rivini lace ballgown and earrings from Susan Hanover, selected a white gold eternity style wedding band with wraparound diamonds. Scher, for his part, sported a traditional tuxedo and chose a plain yellow gold band.  Celebrity Engagement Rings of 2017: See the Bling!  “Everyone always thinks of me as the rule breaker and the troublemaker,” the former Fox News contributor said. “Even in my politics, I don’t fit into a box, I break rules. But my wedding has so many traditional components, it’s so funny.”  Of the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, the New York native gushed: “What I’m looking forward to the most [about my wedding day] is that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing him and having him see me and having that moment where we’re in front together. And we’re just looking at each other. I’ll be in my dress and he’ll be in his tux. It’s just one of those once in a lifetime moments that I kind of want to hold onto.”  Celebrity Engagements of 2018  She continued: “We’ve been living together for a while and we go through the daily grind and all that, but I think there’s only one moment in your life where you’re in front of the minister and you’re saying your vows. And you’re like, ‘My life is gonna be different from here on and I’m gonna be married.’ It’s really exciting and warm and wonderful. I think that moment, that one … I’m gonna take a pause and just kind of absorb it all before I … ’cause you can’t quite get it back the same way ever again.’”  To help coordinate the affair, the Daytime Emmy Award winner tapped Michael Russo Events — wedding planner to the stars — who arranged retro tunes from Richie Hart Events and flowers from Pedestals. “The venue is dripping in garden roses and hydrangea,” a designer from Pedestal’s told Us. “Jedediah wanted a whimsical and garden feel.” The couple’s dinner offering included filet mignon and seared Atlantic salmon followed by a custom designed vanilla and chocolate wedding cake with mousse filling.

       " 'Eric Deggans:  Well, I do think what\\'s interesting to me about this show is that it didn\\'t really explore the roots of why somebody like Roseanne Conner, who, when we last saw her, you know, was supporting abortion rights, supported gay rights, trying to investigate on her own whether she and her husband had unwittingly transmitted racist views to their son, when he didn\\'t want to kiss a black girl in a school pageant, how somebody like that came to believe that voting for Donald Trump was something that made sense, when Hillary Clinton seemed to be much more in line with those values.  And I don\\'t think the show really investigated that. And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.  The episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne\\'s son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.  The discuss that we saw in this new \"Roseanne\" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn\\'t take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.  And I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place.',\n",

       " 'It’s been nearly one week since the release of Demi Lovato \\'s newest album, Tell Me You Love Me and fans are still trying to decipher the meaning behind some of the album’s songs.  While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show , Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about Nick Jonas .  “Supposedly there’s a song about Nick Jonas in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”  Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.  Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.  \"And I was like, \\'You know what, I\\'m just going to write about it.\\' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,\" she continued. \"Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it\\'s ballsy. It\\'s like, \\'Hey! Here\\'s my feelings for you!\\' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”  Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary * Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue.

       " 'After giving birth to her son Eissa Al Mana in January, Janet Jackson worked hard to shed the weight she\\'d put on during her pregnancy. Now, the singer is down 70 pounds. But, more importantly, she\\'s in tip-top health and is totally fit to dance her way through the international \"State of the World\" tour, which began in September and hits 56 cities. So, how did the new mom get into such great shape? Think weights — lots of weights.  Jackson\\'s trainer, Paulette Sybliss, recently filled E! in on her star client\\'s workout routine. Some six weeks after giving birth, Jackson embarked on a \"very vigorous\" training schedule that saw her hitting the gym at least four times a week, and working out for 45 minutes to an hour each time.    At first, Jackson\\'s priority was to shed that baby weight. But, Sybliss also worked with the singer to develop lean muscles. After all, strength and stamina do come in handy when you\\'re dancing your way across the planet! To kick things off, Sybliss developed a routine that incorporated back-to-back exercises with weights.  \"You would look at [Janet] and think she\\'d done like an hour of cardio with me — but when you\\'re working with weights and you\\'re working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it\\'s creating that fat-burning effect both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,\" the trainer explained.  Now that she\\'s on the road and not looking to lose any more weight, Jackson\\'s routine includes plenty of rest. \"I need to keep her fit and healthy to complete the tour. So it changes as in we\\'re not having to work as intensely. We\\'re having to work smart,\" Sybliss said. \"We make sure that she rests, she doesn\\'t get injured, and she can finish this tour. And thank God she\\'s looking great. There have been no illnesses … and that was my goal.\"  When it comes to nutrition, Sybliss believes that moderation is key. As long as her client is eating healthfully 90 percent of the time, the trainer says that a little bite of chocolate cake here and there is harmless. \"You\\'re not eating it every day. You won\\'t get fat overnight,\" she reasons.  We love this fintess guru\\'s level-headed, health-first approach to fitness. And, Jackson\\'s beautifully fit frame is proof that her technique really works.',\n",
       " 'Actor calls former co-star’s remarks about ‘spectrum of behaviour’ in sexual misconduct ‘Orwellian’ and questions defence of disgraced comedian Louis CK  The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men “simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level” and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women.    Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill to spearhead fight against harassment in Hollywood Read more  Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”.  Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”    He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’”  In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously?    “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.”  Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.”  On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.  Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.  “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ”  Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.  “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.”  The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.”  Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.  “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.”  She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.  “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.  Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more  “How about: it’s all fucking wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.  “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.”  Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.  “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.  “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.”',\n",
       " 'Brett Ratner and Serena Williams in 2004. Evan Agostini/Getty Images  A strange clip of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams from her 2005 reality series, \"Venus and Serena: For Real,\" is making the rounds online on Thursday, one day after the Los Angeles published a report detailing multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against the Hollywood producer and director.  In the 90-second clip, Ratner and Williams, his girlfriend at the time, appear to be arguing over issues they\\'ve been having with their long-distance relationship while they watch a tennis match her sister is playing in.  Ratner is physically affectionate and touches Williams throughout the video, even though Williams does not appear to enjoy it.  \"Give me some love,\" Ratner says as he continues to touch her. \"Show me that you care.\"  A seemingly frustrated Williams eventually asks Ratner if he can just watch her sister play and says he\\'s \"being very disturbing.\"  Williams cheers for her sister, and Ratner joins in by yelling, \"Sexy legs!\"  In the clip, Williams tells Ratner she wants to see other people.  \"It\\'s too bad it didn\\'t work out between us,\" she says.  Ratner replies, \"Is this the breakup episode?\"  Ratner then tries to kiss Williams, but she rebuffs him.  \"They don\\'t do this on Nick and Jessica\\'s show,\" Ratner says, referring to Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson\\'s reality-TV series. Ratner tries to kiss Williams once more but is again rejected.  You can watch the clip here:  On Wednesday, the Times reported that six women had accused Ratner of sexually harassment or assault.  In a statement to Business Insider on behalf of the director, Ratner\\'s attorney said Ratner \"vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations that have been reported about him\" and was \"confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims.\"  In another statement to Business Insider, the attorney said Ratner would step away from all \"Warner Bros.-related activities\" until his \"personal issues are resolved.\"',\n",
       " 'Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox\\'s TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled \"Spring Breaks: Part 1\", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in \"200 Cigarettes\", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in \"Gossip\" and \"Dr T and the Women\" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe\\'s Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool\\'s Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.',\n",
       " 'Melissa Etheridge — a passionate advocate for medical marijuana — was busted for drug possession in August.  The 56-year-old singer was returning to the United States from Canada in North Dakota when her tour bus was reportedly stopped by Customs and Border Patrol. After drug-sniffing dogs detected the substance, agents discovered marijuana oil, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Etheridge told police that she uses the drug to manage pain from cancer. Although the drug is legal in California, however, it’s not allowed in North Dakota, said TMZ.  The “Come to My Window” crooner was reportedly booked for possession of a controlled substance and smiled from ear-to-ear in her mugshot, which was obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, she pleaded not guilty. PEOPLE’s requests for comment were not immediately returned by CBP or a rep for Etheridge.  Etheridge first opened up about her weed use in the new Yahoo! project Cannabis & the American Family, and PEOPLE premiered the video clip earlier this year. The Grammy-winner explained that she began using medical marijuana as a holistic alternative to pharmaceuticals when she was undergoing chemotherapy after her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis.  During the initial interview, she added that she has smoked with her wife, Linda Wallem, and two older kids: Bailey, 20, and Beckett, 18. “It’s a very natural, end-of-the-day [thing],” she told Yahoo! “And it brings you much closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink — oh, God, no.”  Since her quotes made the rounds online, Etheridge said she’s received flak for her parenting style and would hope the attention would be directed to a more important issue.  RELATED VIDEO: Melissa Etheridge’s Music Room Is the Coolest  Etheridge later clarified her comments exclusively to PEOPLE.  “I’ve been a celebrity here for almost 30 years, and I’ve done my best to speak truthfully about who I am and my human experience as I go through life, from my work to my family,” the rocker said. “Sometimes I find that I can say something, thinking that the whole world will understand, and they kind of go in another direction. I think if I get a little more specific, it can help guide the conversation in general about cannabis.”  Etheridge discussed why she believes her use of cannabis with her children has been “demonized” — and opened up about how heartbroken she was over the backlash she received for smoking with her kids.  “My children are my priority,” said Etheridge, who is also mom to 10-year-old twin daughters Johnnie Rose and Miller Steven. “I love my children. They are four of the most amazing human beings on earth. I live a very blessed life. I would never want to harm any of them.”',\n",
       " 'Fake news and fake history of family separation  Straight talk  By George H. Rodriguez  The liberal Washington Post is joining the chorus of pro-one borders, pro-illegal immigration groups that are upset that illegal alien families are being separated by immigration officials. They write an emotional opinion piece that manipulates historical facts.  Writer DeNeen L. Brown says America has a history of separating children from families. She uses Native American and black slave children as examples to compare to illegal alien children being separated from their illegal alien parents. But the differences in these three situations are great. How can anyone but a liberal blinded by misguided sympathy ignore the facts?  Native Americans did not come to the U.S. illegally from a foreign country. The policy of separating children from their families was terrible because they were American and they had not done anything wrong. Blacks were forced to come to the U.S. chained to ships and forced to work without pay or benefits. They had committed no crime other than to be a different skin.  Illegal aliens are foreigners who are not forced to come to the United States. They come willingly and, because of their decision, receive legal help, shelter, and food upon arrival and the detainment, even though they broke immigration laws. Illegal aliens make their own decision to travel to the U.S., endangering themselves and their children — the result of breaking immigration laws is the separation of children and families. That’s the same as anyone who commits a crime, especially if they have children along with them when they commit the crime.  This seems to be another liberal media effort to make America look evil for protecting and controlling its borders.  What part of the word illegal don’t Ms. Brown and the Washington Post understand? Illegal aliens come here willingly and of their own decision, bringing and endangering their children. That was not the case with Native American and black slave children.  The “humane” solution is to deport the entire family quickly. We cannot continue to excuse and reward illegal immigration, and we cannot allow our nation to turn into the world’s orphanage for illegal alien children.  George Rodriguez, El Conservador.',\n",
       " 'The cult classic Disney movie that became a staple of Halloween night marathons for millennials across the country is getting its highly demanded resurrection — but probably not as Hocus Pocus fans would have liked.  Hocus Pocus is returning from the grave as a TV movie remake without any of the original cast. Which…feels more like a trick than a treat.  The Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals’ Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline.  But it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega – who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants – isn’t involved either.  This news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades — and as recently as yesterday!  It’s taken so long that Midler’s enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015, “After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.” But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying, “I would love [to do a sequel]. I think we’ve all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn’t created any groundswell of movement.”  And in his recent interview in which he mentioned that the sequel would be made for TV, Garris said that he expected the three original actresses to return: “If they don’t do that I think it would be a big mistake because all three of them are still so incredibly potent and powerful and great performers and who else can recreate those characters?”  Alas, it is not meant to be, and we’ll likely see some younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars step into those crooked, magical dancing shoes. Let’s hope if they do a musical sequence, it can live up to Bette Midler’s iconic rendition of “I Put a Spell On You.”',\n",

Some of us are still adjusting to the fact that Brangelina is really, truly donezo. While some of us are patiently waiting on a reunion of the two movie stars, we may be holding our breaths because it seems that Angie has a new man in her life.  We don\\'t know a whole lot about the identity of this new guy but there is talk he is British and quite well-off. A source close to the Salt actress says that the two met through mutual friends. The romance is only starting and rumors suggest that sparks are definitely flying.  Here is what we know so far about Angie\\'s secret new beau:  1. She is keeping her new man a secret.  “Angie is keeping her cards close to her chest, but she’s very happy,” a source said. “She doesn’t want his identity to be revealed until her divorce from Brad [Pitt] is official, so she’s playing coy whenever anyone asks about her love life. She doesn’t want a media circus around her man.”  2. She\\'s taking precaution to remain discreet.  A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angiiii_jolie) on Jun 28, 2018 at 5:56am PDT  Sources on set say the actress only refers to her new beau “by one initial,” and has asked the producers to arrange her schedule so that she can leave town on weekends. “Apparently, they’re having romantic weekends in the English countryside, away from prying eyes, whenever they get the chance.”  3. Her kids have met him.  “She’s introduced him to the kids already, which is a sure sign that this is more than just a fling,” says the source. “They will always be her priority and she wouldn’t take that step if she didn’t see this romance lasting.”  4. This isn\\'t the first time we\\'re hearing about him.

But time proved these accusations false. The fact that she is filming Maleficent 2 in London re-ignited these rumors.  5. Other sources close to her say the rumors are false.

She has been linked to other men.

She’d love to get to know Ed and find out what makes him tick.”  7. Brad has been dating, too.  Pitt has been linked to a few other women as well including Margot Robbie — who Angelina supposedly hates. A source told OK! magazine about Brad\\'s pursuit of Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now. [He has] tried to woo her for numerous movie projects.

The 41-year-old Coldplay frontman and the Fifty Shades of Grey star, who began dating last year, have been spending increasing amounts of time together.  Now, an insider has divulged that Chris is considering co-habitation.  “Dakota and Chris are smitten. They’ve been spending so much time together that Chris thought the logical step was to ask her to move in with him,” a source told Closer magazine. “They’re even considering throwing a moving-in party with friends and family to celebrate.”  The couple first sparked romance rumours back in October (17), when they were spotted on a sushi dinner date in Los Angeles. In November, Dakota was seen in prime position at one of his shows in Buenos Aires and the following month they enjoyed a romantic break in Paris.  Since then, Dakota has reportedly been spending time getting to know Chris’ children, Apple, 14, and Moses, 12, with the blessing of his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow, as well as hanging out with the Shakespeare in Love star and her fiance, TV executive Brad Falchuk.  “Chris and Gwyneth have a fantastic relationship and it was her suggestion that Dakota spends more time with the children,” the insider continued. “Chris has even told friends he can see marriage and kids with Dakota, so Gwyneth knows it's the real deal.”  Gwyneth is making a big move herself this year following her “conscious uncoupling” from the British rocker in 2014. She is set to marry Brad, reportedly in ritzy resort The Hamptons soon, and loved-up Chris is apparently keen to take 28-year-old Dakota as his date.  “Chris would like to take Dakota with him to Gwyneth and Brad’s wedding and although nothing is settled yet, he’s eager for Dakota to feel like part of his life and wants to prove he’s committed,” the source added.

The former couple’s often rocky romance was featured on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Though they once called off their engagement after an explosive fight over cheating rumors, they eventually tied the knot in June 2013.

       " '***WARNING: this piece contains spoilers through the most recent season of Game of Thrones***  Given the ceaseless flood of reviews, critiques, commentaries and anguished think-pieces that have emerged in its wake, it feels like Taylor Swift‘s new single “Look What You Made Me Do” has been with us for far longer than a mere five days. Its stunning performance on streaming and video charts and its stunningly-brutal critical reception were perhaps only eclipsed in the pop culture blogosphere this weekend by the season finale of Game of Thrones, an event every bit as anticipated and monoculturally-in tune as a TSwift music video.  With the two overlapping in such a profound way, it got this author thinking; maybe there is more in common between a song of ice and fire and a song interpolating Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” than we once thought. Maybe, just maybe, this happenstance of scheduling has allowed us to see with a clearer eye what Taylor Swift is up to with her latest album cycle: namely, that she has now become the Cersei Lannister of pop music.  Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  And while it may seem unfair to compare Swift to a monarch who murdered hundreds of innocent people by detonating a cache of explosives under a cathedral, the pop star’s current reinvention in support of her upcoming album Reputation carries many of the same personal traits that have allowed Cersei to usurp herself to the Iron Throne of Westeros. And not just because both of them are blonde, caucasian women enjoying more extremes of wealth and privilege than we are capable of imagining.  The lead-up to Taylor unveiling her latest radio-juggernaut was one that played on the now-widespread public opinion of the pop star being a ‘snake.’ While there are numerous plot points in that story (for a detailed overview, head here), the most integral is the moment last year when she was outed as a liar by Kim Kardashian West. The world saw for themselves that the Taylor Swift PR-factory had completely fabricated the notion that Kanye West acted without her knowledge or consent when honoring her with the lyrical compliment that they “might still have sex.” The catastrophic blow to her clean-cut image led Swift to decamp out of the public eye for the better part of a year, only emerging now with “Look What You Made Me Do,” a long-overdue – and some would argue, unnecessary – response.  Cersei found herself in a very similar PR disaster during Game of Thrones‘ fifth season. After cultivating an image of being a woman of high moral character worthy of a seat on the King’s Small Council, she had this narrative irrevocably destroyed by the High Sparrow (the Westerosi-equivalent of the Pope) who promptly had her imprisoned for adultery, treason and conspiracy for murder. Like Taylor, her cover was blown with cold, hard proof, and she was marched naked through the sea of jeering common-folk to atone for her sins. In Taylor’s case this naked march was metaphorical, yet the sentiment remains much the same.  Now, returned to positions of power after well-earned respites to lick their wounds, both women are employing a simple, one-point strategy: enact violent revenge on all those that have wronged them, regardless of any and all other factors. For Cersei, this meant that aforementioned cathedral explosion in order to cast aside her enemies and seize limitless power. For Taylor, it meant “Look What You Made Me Do,” a heavy-handed earworm written in order to cast aside her previous public perceptions and seize limitless pop music power.  The key to the psychology of both of these women at this new stage of their career is that they are performing a balancing act. Taylor and Cersei have demonstrably proven they are at the peak of their powers. They tell us with frequent, repetitive kiss-offs to their enemies, and they show us with their newfound affinity for black clothing and garments with pointed shoulders. But this heightened ‘do not fuck with me’ power lies in us accepting two, at-times conflicting narratives – that they are both victim and merciless badass.  HBO  This is not to say that a victim can never become a badass or vice versa, but in the case of both Taylor and Cersei, their personas now implore us to stand in awe of a mightiness earned not from good works but from being victimized by their detractors. Detractors who, for the record, were not necessarily wrong in their attempts to bring these women down a peg. Would we not have wanted Kim Kardashian to expose Taylor’s innocence for the self-serving marketing ploy it really is? Would we not have wanted the High Sparrow to point out that Cersei shouldn’t be a figurehead of the monarchy after conspiring with her cousin/lover to assassinate the previous king, her ex-husband?  And as Taylor begins to smash records left and right with her latest single and as Cersei continues to scheme her way into screwing over everyone at the cost of the innocent bystanders of her kingdom, it becomes clear to see that their new respective characters are, ultimately, a weak choice. Where before both women were reacting to high-stakes situations in ways that were questionable but grounded by a real-world motivation, they have now been reduced to one-dimensional figureheads of ‘who cares look at how mean I am’ untrustworthiness, bereft of all the rich character development they have built over the past decade.  There are endless ways to get even, but not all of them involve sacrificing every last trace of your character in the name of revenge, let alone a revenge that no one really cares about anymore.

       " 'Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man: Homecoming was played by Zendaya. Samuel L. Jackson commanded the role of Nick Fury in The Avengers. In the movie Thor: Ragnarok, Idris Elba is the Asgardian gatekeeper Heimdall. Quvenzhané Wallis starred as the always singing and hopeful foster kid Annie. Brandy Norwood found her happily ever after as Cinderella with Whitney Houston dressed in gold as her fairy godmother. Will Smith protected Earth from aliens as Agent J in Men in Black.  What’s the significant common feature of these actors and their characters? They are all African-Americans playing characters who were originally white in their respective comic or children’s book.  Adding to the list is Candice Patton, who is in her fourth season of The Flash as Iris West. West is white in the DC comic, and her character is the no-fear-no-matter-the-danger, tough-as-nails journalist and longtime best friend of Barry Allen, aka The Flash. They’re married now and she leads S.T.A.R. Labs, the team behind The Flash in stopping crazy meta-human activity in Central City. The series airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.  The Plano, Texas, native began her career in Hollywood with a stint on The Young and the Restless after being chosen in a national college casting search for a guest role. Once Patton graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, she moved to Los Angeles to continue her acting career. Her television credits include appearances on Entourage, Castle, Grey’s Anatomy, The Game, CSI: Miami and Heroes, to name a few.  “It’s a huge honor because young people and future generations will remember Iris West as black,” said Patton, 29. “If my casting wasn’t working [for TV], they would have changed it for the film, but they didn’t [and cast Kiersey Clemons, another African-American woman], and that’s a great thing.”  There’s still a long way to go with diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, but celebrating every inch, foot and mile fought to push the glass ceiling higher is just as important as the fight.  While in Washington, D.C., for the “DC in D.C.” pop culture event, Patton spoke with The Undefeated about being a woman of color in Hollywood, how the leading lady on and offscreen has evolved and just how tearing her ACL as a cheerleader jump-started her passion for acting.  What have you learned from playing Iris West?  She is strong, fearless, passionate and emotional. There is strength in vulnerability, and Iris isn’t afraid to show her emotions. She won’t let that defeat her.  How is it both an honor and responsibility playing Iris, who is traditionally white in the comic book?  It’s a huge honor because young people and future generations will remember Iris West as black. They can see themselves as the ingénue. Iris is the love interest of the hero, he’s the one he desires. She’s the leader of the team; she’s the one who rallies everyone together. And that’s a really important role model for young girls and even boys.  #KeepIrisBlack has trended on Twitter. What significance does that have to you?  I got into acting to A) pay my rent and B) live out my dreams … but another part of it became being a voice for so many young women of color. They get to see themselves on-screen [when they watch The Flash]. I craved to see that as a child growing up. It was just never there. All of my heroes were white and blond. There’s nothing wrong with that, but what made it difficult for me as a black girl was that it felt outside of myself, like something over there … something that was so cool but could never happen to me. Even when I was starting out in Hollywood, all of the roles I was going for was the best friend of the pretty white girl. So now for the first time, I’m [metaphorically] the pretty white girl.  What actresses do you look up to?  I remember watching Halle Berry win that Oscar and thinking how an acting career path was possible for me. Her grace, dignity and class are all things I’ve aspired toward. Zoe Saldana has done an amazing job in the diverse roles she has acted in, and that further paves a huge path for women of color too.  Hollywood is recognizing interracial relationships, like that of Iris and Barry on The Flash, and finally normalizing it. Why is that important?  It’s very important because it becomes normal and less fearful for people who haven’t seen interracial couples in their own neighborhoods and communities. People see Iris and Barry and say, “Oh they’re just like us … a normal relationship.” Having diverse storylines in general across film and TV impacts communities and [deep-rooted] mindsets.  Leading women in TV and film have evolved. How would you define what a leading lady is today?  The leading lady is extremely important to the other heroes in the show. We used to see women as the sidekicks, but we’re moving away from that and women are becoming the heroes of their own stories. Iris is stepping into that, especially this season.  [Outside of the screen], we as a culture have a specific way of what we’re used to seeing women as or how we want to see women. But the change is happening because women are now deciding for themselves and we are saying, “No more.” We’re making choices that are going to make people uncomfortable because before it wasn’t the feminine way and it wasn’t acceptable for women [to do that]. But now we are seeing women step up and say, “No more. Thanks for your input, but I decide on what I wear, what profession I’m going to pursue and what I deserve to get paid.”  How did cheerleading play a part in you becoming an actress?  I grew up in Texas, so you either played football, went to the games or was a cheerleader. I enjoyed it a lot, but then tore my ACL. I couldn’t cheer for a while, so I ended up hanging out in the theater club, and the rest is pretty much history.  What insecurities have you overcome?  Fear of being wrong, making mistakes and being the perfect celebrity for people to look up to. I learned that I have to be true to who I am because people will see my sincerity through a mistake that way.  Where does your courage come from?  My mom and dad. My mom always tells me to be as proud as a peacock, and my dad as a now-retired FBI agent would say, “Just because you’re shot doesn’t mean you’re going to die.” I go through trials and tribulations, but it doesn’t mean it’s the end of the world. You just have to keep pushing through.  How has being a new dog mom changed your life?  My dog, Zoe, has changed my life and has been a great anxiety relief. She’s given me that sense of responsibility to love something outside of myself. Sometimes, this career can feel so self-absorbed because it’s a lot about you and your character. I just felt like it was about me, me, me, me for way too long. Having Zoe takes me outside of myself, which is great.  What’s your favorite throwback shows?  I grew up idolizing Lucille Ball. I’d watch I Love Lucy every single night. There was something about how she made me feel good and entertained. I just knew that I wanted to do that and be part of being in people’s home every night. Acting was a hobby that turned into my passion.  What emoji do you use the most?  The side-eye one. 👀  What’s your favorite movie-time snack?  Keiynan Lonsdale [who plays my brother Wally/Kid Flash on The Flash] introduced me to adding Maltesers chocolate to a warm bag of popcorn. I don’t even like chocolate, but this snack is on point.',\n",

       " 'I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in “The Town” features the “Bride Wars” of Boston accents. Her performance in “The Age of Adaline” — as a woman “cursed” to stay 30 forever — was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn’t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it’s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something — beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I’d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don’t think they’re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don’t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he’s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else’s turn to be “it.” (It’s always someone else’s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn’t done with that.',\n",
       " 'Mila Kunis gushes over husband Ashton Kutcher: \\'I got a man that has got a lot of patience\\'  The 34-year-old actress has been married to Ashton Kutcher - with whom she has three-year-old daughter Wyatt and 16-month-old son Dimitri - since 2015, and has heaped the praise on her spouse, saying she is “lucky” to have found him.  Speaking to E! News, she said: \"I have the world\\'s greatest husband. I swear, I got very lucky, man. I got a man that has got a lot of patience and is incredibly supportive of our family.\"  Despite only marrying three years ago, Mila and 40-year-old Ashton have known each other since the late 90s, when they starred together on ‘That 70s Show’.  Ashton Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis have become parents for the second time (AP)  They began dating in 2012, three years before tying the knot, when ‘Jobs’ actor Ashton was undergoing a divorce from first wife Demi Moore, whom he married in 2005.  Mila’s comments come after she previously gushed over her brood, saying she and Ashton are “grateful” to have two tots of their own, as they were desperate to start a family.  She said in November: \"I have an 11-month-old and a three-year-old - I have tiny little humans. Ashton and I wanted kids so bad; we were so ready to be parents.  \"We were able to have this little family the way we wanted, and I\\'m so grateful for it and it\\'s the one thing that I can\\'t control.  (L-R) Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are not shy of public displays of affection  \"That\\'s where my vulnerability is. My job, it comes and goes. You don\\'t get a job, you get a job, you don\\'t get a job. Your kids, you just want one thing.”  Previously, the ‘Black Swan’ star also credited Ashton with helping her learn about the “business side” of their shared profession.  She said: \"Honestly, full disclosure, when I started dating Ashton, I was like, \\'I don\\'t want to know [about the] business side, it makes me so uncomfortable.\\' And he said, \\'Right, stop, get on the call.\\'  \"And then I started educating myself, getting the language right. I would ask him questions, Googled lots of things, and now I know what everybody\\'s doing, I know what I can do, I know what I can ask for. I am way more involved than I was five years ago.

       " 'We\\'re going to learn why she became this way, why she started writing this kind of music, why her fan base is predominantly women who have gone through so many things and look up to her.\\t0\\r\\nEither You\\'re the Fastest or Not\": Michael Fassbender on His Car-Racing Obsession  The two-time Academy Award nominee is part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers and is fresh off a first-place finish in the first of six series at the Daytona Ferrari Challenge, with another race on June 9.  \"What have I learned?\" With the din of race cars screaming around the Laguna Seca racetrack outside Monterey, California, Michael Fassbender — wearing a racing suit, hair mussed from the Nomex balaclava and helmet he\\'s had on his head all morning — leans in as a big grin spreads over his face. \"I\\'ve learned that I\\'m always two seconds off where I need to be.\"  Two seconds in a line reading might not mean much, but on this 2.2-mile track with 11 turns (on the corkscrew, \"head for the tree,\" he advises), it\\'s an awful lot of time. Part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers, from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen to Patrick Dempsey, Fassbender — who spent his childhood in Ireland glued to the TV watching Michael Schumacher win one F1 title after another — is the real deal.  The 41-year-old star, who picked up the sport in 2016, possesses an encyclopedic, arcane knowledge of 1980s Group B rally racing and has logged more than 120 hours behind the wheel of his 488 Ferrari Challenge car — valued at $330,000, featuring a 670-horsepower, 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 engine. It\\'s numbered 133, because, as he says, \"three is my lucky number.\"  Luck, though, had little to do with Fassbender winning the first of six series (his next race is in Montreal on June 9) in the Ferrari Challenge 2018 season, which opened at Florida\\'s Daytona Speedway in January, where speeds exceed 190 miles per hour. Says Ferrari Challenge head instructor Didier Theys: \"From the start, Michael has shown a great deal of dedication and talent as a competitor.\"  Racing is the reward that rounds out a career marked (so far) by two Oscar nominations, for his work in 2013\\'s 12 Years a Slave and 2015\\'s Steve Jobs.  \"It\\'s one of the things about the job that I do that\\'s a huge perk, just an absolute dream come true,\" says Fassbender, who lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with Alicia Vikander, whom he married in October. \"It was always a goal to do some sort of racing at 40, but I didn\\'t imagine that I\\'d be in a series like this with very powerful, very fast 660-odd horsepower machines.\" Fassbender adds with a laugh, \"It\\'s a lot more fun prepping for this than learning lines at home,\" the downside being, \"if you miss an apex or mess up a corner, you don\\'t get a \\'take two.\\'\"  He points out the other contrast between his two chosen vocations — the type of risk involved: \"It\\'s a different kind of butterflies. For a film, I\\'ve usually been putting together this character, but haven\\'t really shown it to anybody. That first day of shooting, it\\'s like, \\'God, I hope this works.\\' But racing, once you start doing it, focusing on what you have to do, you can\\'t think of anything else. When you\\'re driving, literally, if your mind wanders, you\\'re going to go off the track.\"  There\\'s a process to maintaining composure while white-knuckling it for four 30-minute races over weekends that begin with Thursday practice laps and end Sunday. Says Fassbender, \"When it comes to the first practice day, your brain and body have to assimilate to these high speeds. You get into the car and think, \\'Oh, God, I can\\'t do this,\\' but it\\'s incredible how the body and mind adapt — it\\'s just about focusing and trying to get in a rhythm. Racing is something that really does bring that level of forced meditation — it\\'s very rare in life.\"  Over time, the actor, who plays Magneto in February\\'s X-Men: Dark Phoenix, has reached an understanding about anxiety: \"Before my first race here last year, I literally thought I was going to vomit. I was in the toilet beforehand, breathing. I was nervous, but that feeling is pretty special, that first race feeling.\"  With Fassbender, winning really does seem to matter. \"Like many of his fellow drivers, he\\'s something of a perfectionist and determined to win,\" says Theys.  Notes the star, making a nod to a perspective that many a fellow Oscar nominee might share: \"You race to win, for sure, that\\'s the goal. Either you\\'re fastest or you\\'re not — that\\'s the allure for me. It\\'s always great to be on the podium.\"  This story first appeared in the June 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

       " 'Are congratulations in order? Daniel Radcliffe reportedly asked his longtime girlfriend Erin Darke to marry him and the two have been shopping for rings that you just have to hear about!  Daniel Radcliffe may “disapperate” right off the market! The 27 year-old Harry Potter star has reportedly asked his girlfriend of five years TV and film actress Erin Darke, 28, to marry him, according to Star magazine. Despite denials of an engagement from Daniel’s reps, multiple sources told the mag about the couple’s alleged ring shopping outings. “Daniel recently took Erin ring shopping and spared no expense,” the insider said. “They’ve been talking about marriage for a while now and thought this was something worth splurging on.”  Daniel reportedly is not one to splurge on major expenses even though he has $97 million at his disposal. He’s practically richer than Gringotts! He and Erin “live a very quiet, ordinary life together in Manhattan,” a source told the mag. The pair have definitely lived their lives fairly under the radar with the exception of a truly impressive karaoke performance! Daniel and Erin were spotted in Half Moon Bay, CA during the summer of 2015 giving their all to a performance of Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady.” We love these two together! A source described Erin as “an incredibly calming influence on Daniel,” who struggled with alcoholism during his Harry Potter tenure and has been sober for more than three years now.  Fans will be waiting longer than a few years for Daniel to don his Hogwarts robes again, but the actor did leave a small chance for his return in the future. “The circumstances would have to be pretty extraordinary. But then I am sure Harrison Ford said that with Han Solo and look what happened there! So I am saying, ‘No,’ for now but leaving room to backtrack in the future,” he told Britain’s Radio Times in June 2016. Wouldn’t that be amazing?  HollywoodLifers, do you think Daniel is engaged?

       " 'Lena Dunham\\'s Lamby drama continues to escalate. (Photo: Ben Gabbe, Getty)  2017\\'s unlikeliest feud involves Lena Dunham, her dog Lamby and BARC, the Brooklyn shelter where the actress originally adopted the rescue pup.  Several weeks ago, Dunham revealed on Instagram that she sent Lamby to the Zen Dog canine rehabilitation center in Los Angeles, before the dog was eventually re-homed. \"Lamby suffered terrible abuse as a pup that made having him in a typical home environment dangerous to him and others,\" she wrote.  However, the BARC Shelter is disputing Dunham\\'s account of Lamby\\'s history of abuse. On Thursday, Robert Vazquez, a spokesman for the no-kill animal shelter, gave a stinging interview to Yahoo denying that Dunham\\'s dog was as mistreated as she claimed.  “It’s just hard to believe the dog was nasty when she took Lamby to every green room with her when Girls was still a thing four years ago,\" he said, noting that he wouldn\\'t have adopted the dog out if he felt it had insurmountable issues.  Vazquez also took issue with Dunham\\'s claims that Lamby had “three other homes (and) three other names” before she owned him.  “We checked the records for Lamby ... He was ‘owner-surrendered\" he said, adding that it was because the owner said they didn\\'t have enough time for him. \"So we do not know where she got ‘multiple owners that abused the dog,\"  In an Instagram post Thursday night, Dunham shared a painting of Lamby that hangs in her home, while defending her version of events in the caption. \"It\\'s come to my attention that the staff at the shelter where I adopted Lamby have a very different account of his early life and behavioral issues than I do. While I\\'m sorry to have disappointed them, I can\\'t apologize,\" she wrote.  \"I have weathered a lot of micro-scandals but this one hurts MOST, because of the vulnerability of letting people know Lamby and my story, and because I miss him so damn much,\" she continued. This is the painting that greets me every day when I walk into my home. This is the animal who taught me about loving and letting go. I know I\\'m a lot of fun to place your issues on, but I won\\'t let anyone hang their hat on this peg. Not this time.\"  Dunham isn\\'t the only celebrity angering animal advocates this week. Katy Perry, who visited Australia to promote her upcoming tour, appeared in an ad for a n Australian department store chain, where she tells her dog Nugget to \"go chase some koalas.\"  Apparently, that\\'s a big no-no in a country where koalas are endangered species and dogs are among their biggest threats. \"[It\\'s] inappropriate on so many levels,\" an Australian wildlife expert told the country\\'s Courier-Mail newspaper. \"Perry is a role model to so many young people, and this just destroys all the good work we do to try to encourage people not to let their dogs come into contact with koalas.\"  Watch the original ad below, which has since been re-edited without Perry\\'s offending line.

       " 'Brad Pitt is reportedly dismissing ex Angelina Jolie’s claim that she’s hurting for money as their bitter divorce battle continues. According to The Blast, Pitt is scoffing at Jolie’s alleged financial woes — because she was just paid more than $20 million for her role in Maleficent 2!  The actors are embroiled in a vicious court feud over their divorce and custody of their six kids. As RadarOnline.com has reported, in the past week, legal papers have shown that Jolie, 43, accused Pitt, 54, of not paying her enough child support over the past two years.  PHOTOS: Somber Brad Pitt Speaks Out After Reaching Custody Agreement With Angelina Jolie  The River Runs Through It star then slammed back, saying he actually gave her a loan of $8 million to buy her L.A. mansion and gave her an additional $1.3 million for their children.  Jolie soon countered, saying that “A loan is not, however, child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate.”  The Tomb Raider actress’ attorney Bley DeJean later said to PEOPLE, “What has been filed by Brad’s side today is a blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children.”  PHOTOS: Angelina Is A ‘Spoiled Brat’ Who Lives In ‘Crazytown!’ Sony Execs Slam Jolie In Newly Leaked Emails — Their Top 13 Disses Exposed  The Blast reported that sources very close to Pitt say that Jolie’s claims that she is hard up for cash and struggling to take care of the children while she has primary custody are “crazy.”  Jolie will star in the upcoming Disney sequel, Maleficent 2, which is scheduled to come out in 2020. The first Maleficent was a huge hit with Jolie playing the powerful fairy queen.  Sources told The Blast however that for ten years, Pitt has been the majority earner of the two.

'Terri and Russell are not dating and are certainly not planning a wedding.'  This isn't the first time the pair have been linked to one another.  Family: Russell is seen here with ex and mother of his children, Danielle Spencer  Rumour mill: In May, New Idea again reported an 'insider close to the actor' claiming the couple were unable to 'fight their love any longer' (Terri is seen here with late husband Steve Irwin)  In May, New Idea again reported an 'insider close to the actor' claiming the couple were unable to 'fight their love any longer.'  But at the time, an Australian Zoo spokesperson laughed off the reports, saying: 'She'll be flattered!  'Russell Crowe is a long-time friend of the Irwin family and has been for many years, [but] the report that Terri and Russell are romantically linked is simply untrue.'  The story also claimed that neighbours have seen Russell 'half-naked' on the balcony of the wildlife warrior's $3.2 million home on the Sunshine Coast, even waving to locals as they pass.  'The truth is, they're both at similar stages of their lives and have so much in common - kids, looking for love, big careers.  'It was only a matter of time before they fell in love,' claimed the source.\",\n",
       " 'As the couple deny fresh cheating and divorce rumours we take a look back at David\\'s alleged affair with Rebecca Loos.  The world\\'s most famous soccer player marries a superstar pop singer, what could possibly go wrong? Almost ever since David and Victoria Beckham\\'s 1999 nuptials, their relationship has been plagued by tales of alleged affairs, most famously the purported affair between David and his former-assistant, Rebecca Loos. And it seems a new-wave of cheating accusations could hit the Beckhams, as Twitter this weekend was set alight with rumours of infidelity and an impending Beckham divorce. Victoria, 44, and David, 43, have since released a statement denying the new rumours, and branding them \"fake news\". If you\\'re experiencing déjà vu, it\\'s because David and Victoria have penned similar statements defending their relationship in 2003, when Rebecca Loos famously claimed she had an affair with the soccer champion.  David and Victoria show a united front in the face of fresh cheating rumours.  David\\'s alleged affair with assistant Rebecca Loos  In 2003, David was in the prime of his football career. The England Captain had been sold by his home club Manchester United to Spain\\'s Real Madrid, for a whopping price. And while his star had never been brighter, a shock was soon to hit the Beckham family. In September of that year, David was spotted with a woman at a nightclub in Madrid. The woman was later identified as his assistant Rebecca Loos. Subsequently, the rumour mill kick-started into overdrive, churning out tales that the Beckham marriage was in trouble, which David denied. The now-defunct News Of The World, published a story from \"a source\" outlining several sexual encounters David and Loos allegedly had after that night at the club. They also reported the two exchanged racy texts. The story claimed Victoria contacted the assistant, warning her to stay away.  Rebecca Loos reportedly had an affair with David Beckham while the pair were working together in Spain.  Rebecca Loos\\' brother\\'s statement  Loos brother then surprised British tabloids by claiming his sister had confirmed to him that she\\'d had an affair with David in Spain. \"Rebecca phoned home early this morning. I am overwhelmed with shock,\" Loos\\' brother John Charles told the Daily Mail in April 2004. \"Rebecca was upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year. She became very down and cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken. I thought it was because of professional reasons. But now I am beginning to understand there must have been more to it.\"  Rebecca Loos, Victoria Beckham and her son Romeo watch David play for Real Madrid back in 2003.  While explosive allegations of David\\'s infidelity flew, Victoria reportedly packed up their two children and flew to Switzerland, where David was to meet them from Madrid. Spokespeople for the family said the trip was a long-planned getaway and not a plan to escape media attention.  David\\'s statement on alleged affair  In response to Loos\\' brother\\'s comments, David released a statement. \"During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life,\" it read. \"What appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.\"  Rebecca Loos\\' tell-all  Rebecca gave an explosive tell-all interview with SKY TV alleging her professional relationship turned romantic with David as he grew lonely in Madrid. \"I think the chemistry between David and I was so strong and people were not happy because I was being very unprofessional and he\\'s a married man,\" she said at the time. \"He is very generous lover. He gives a lot. He pleases. He knows what you want. It\\'s all about you and not so much about him. It\\'s nice.\" When asked about the Beckham\\'s intention to involved layers, Loos replied, \"What are they consulting their lawyers for? What can they do? I think they have worked very hard at getting the image they have and I think they will do everything they can to maintain it.\" \"So whether that involves having happy shots taken or calling their lawyers it\\'s up to them. I am 100 percent sure of what I am talking about, there no doubt in my mind I have no reason to lie -- why should I? I am just here to tell you my experience. He knows the truth and I know the truth.\" Again, Victoria and David vehemently denied Loos\\' story calling it \"absurd and unsubstantiated\". Victoria and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo relocated to Spain so the family could be together with David.  The couple have weathered allegations of affairs time and time again.  The Beckham\\'s sue  Following the months and months of stories of alleged infidelities, the soccer player and his wife turned to their lawyers, seeking justice. In 2004, they filed a lawsuit against News of the World, after a story was published claiming David also had an affair with a beautician named Danielle Heath. The couple then amended the complaint in 2005 to include another story by the publisher which detailed quotes from the couple\\'s former-nanny Abbie Gibson, that the Beckham marriage was a lie. They also sued the nanny for breach of confidence. \"We are sick and tired of people trying to make money at the expense of our family,\" the Beckhams said in a statement.  The ultimate power-couple.  Where is Rebecca Loos now?  Fourteen years after her alleged affair with David Beckham, Rebecca Loos has completely turned her life around. After being dismissed from her position at Real Madrid, Loos went on to star on a range of reality TV shows. The Spanish-born beauty eventually fell in love with medical adviser Sven Christjar Skaiaa, who worked on one of the shows she appeared on.',\n",
       " \"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband.\",\n",

He admitted to stealing over $5 million from Morissette, as well as an additional $1.7 million from two other unnamed clients.  According to the Associated Press at the time, the incidents occurred between May 2010 and January 2014, with Schwartz falsely listing the criminal withdrawals as “sundry/personal expenses.” When first questioned about the mismanagement by prosecutors, he initially claimed that he had invested in an illicit marijuana growing business.  Schwartz will serve six years in prison along with $8.65 million in restitution, Variety reports. He will report for his prison sentence on July 11.

       " 'Which celebrities are most likely to have had nose jobs? The subject is a hotly debated one. Some celebs come clean and admit that they\\'ve had work done, including a \"nose job\" (rhinoplasty). Others definitely look like they\\'ve had some sort of plastic surgery, but they won\\'t say one way or the other. This list includes many celebrities who are suspect, including celebrities with big noses who all of a sudden look different one day. Everyone listed here is rumored to have had a nose job, or has openly admitted to having one. Some are obvious, while others are far more subtle. Vote for the celebs you think have gone under the knife to alter their appearance by getting a nose job – and add anyone that might be missing, too!  Celebrities who are rumored to have had nose jobs include Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Zac Efron, Natalie Portman, Patrick Dempsey, Megyn Kelly, Tom Cruise, Ellen Barkin, and Blake Lively. Nose job surgery isn\\'t a huge deal, but these celebs like to keep their privacy. With some celebrities, spotting a nose job is rather obvious: Jennifer Aniston, anyone? And of course, no list of celebs and/or nose jobs would be complete without the Queen of Plastic Surgery, Joan Rivers. She openly admits having multiple procedures over several decades.  Things don\\'t always turn out well, especially when multiple plastic surgeries (and nose jobs) are involved (La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson). Anytime anyone goes under the knife for any reason, it\\'s a risk – to both health, and career. Jennifer Grey has said that getting a nose job ruined her career (no one recognized her)!  Celebrities who may (or may not) have had nose jobs also include supermodels. Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss are both suspect, for example. There\\'s no hard proof, but looking at older photos, it\\'s hard not to wonder. Maybe the celeb just grew into their nose –or maybe not. If they\\'re suspect, they\\'re on the list. Period.  Not everyone, though, is so forthcoming about whether they have or haven\\'t had a nose job. That\\'s why this list exists! Sometimes it\\'s hard to be sure, but you suspect it.

       " 'Death of Diana redirects here. For information on the murder of Diana Miller, see Murder of Diana Miller  On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales died as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash in the Pont de l\\'Alma road tunnel in Paris, France. Her companion, Dodi Fayed, and the driver of the Mercedes S280, Henri Paul, were pronounced dead at the scene. A fourth passenger in the car, bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, was seriously injured but survived.  Although the media blamed the behaviour of the paparazzi who followed the car, a French judicial investigation in 1999 found that the crash was caused by Henri Paul, who lost control of the Mercedes at high speed while he was intoxicated and under the effects of prescription drugs. Paul was the deputy head of security at the Hôtel Ritz at the time of the crash and had goaded the paparazzi waiting outside the hotel earlier.[1] His inebriation may have been made worse by anti-depressants and traces of an anti-psychotic in his body.[2][3] The investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.[4] After hearing evidence at the British inquest in 2008, a jury returned to a verdict of \"unlawful killing\" by Paul and the paparazzi pursuing the car.[5]  Diana\\'s death caused a substantial outpouring of worldwide grief, including numerous floral tributes and her funeral was watched by an estimated 2 billion people. The Royal Family were criticised in the press for their reaction to Diana\\'s death.  Circumstances [ edit ]  Events preceding the crash [ edit ]  A car similar to that involved in the accident.  On Saturday, 30 August 1997, Diana left Sardinia on a private jet and arrived in Paris with Dodi Fayed, the son of Mohamed Al-Fayed.[6] They had stopped there en route to London, having spent the preceding nine days together on board Mohamed Al-Fayed\\'s yacht Jonikal on the French and Italian Riviera. They had intended to stay there for the night. Mohamed Al-Fayed was and is the owner of the Hôtel Ritz Paris. He also owned an apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye, a short distance from the hotel, just off the Avenue des Champs Elysées.  Henri Paul, the deputy head of security at the Ritz Hotel, had been instructed to drive the hired black 1994 Mercedes-Benz S280 in order to elude the paparazzi;[9] a decoy vehicle left the Ritz first from the main entrance on Place Vendôme, attracting a throng of photographers. Diana and Fayed then departed from the hotel\\'s rear entrance,[10] Rue Cambon at around 00:20 on 31 August CEST (22:20 on 30 August UTC), heading for the apartment in Rue Arsène Houssaye. They did this to avoid the nearly 30 photographers waiting in the front of the hotel.[10] They were the rear passengers; Trevor Rees-Jones, a member of the Fayed family\\'s personal protection team, was in the (right) front passenger seat. It was believed that Diana and Dodi were not wearing seat belts.[12] After leaving the Rue Cambon and crossing the Place de la Concorde, they drove along Cours la Reine and Cours Albert 1er – the embankment road along the right bank of the River Seine – into the Place de l\\'Alma underpass.[13]  The crash [ edit ]  At 12:23 a.m., Paul lost control of the vehicle at the entrance to the Pont de l\\'Alma tunnel. The car struck the righthand wall and then swerved to the left of the two-lane carriageway before it collided head-on with the 13th pillar that supported the roof.[14] The car was travelling at an estimated speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).[15] It then spun and hit the stone wall of the tunnel backwards, finally coming to a stop. The impact caused substantial damage, particularly to the front half of the vehicle, as there was no guard rail between the pillars to prevent this. Witnesses arriving shortly after the accident reported smoke.[17] Witnesses also reported that photographers on motorcycles \"swarmed the Mercedes sedan before it entered the tunnel.\"[12]  The aftermath [ edit ]  The entrance to the Pont de l\\'Alma Tunnel, the site where Diana was fatally injured  As the victims lay in the wrecked car, the photographers, who had been driving slower and were accordingly some distance behind the Mercedes, reached the scene. The photographers were on motorcycles.[10] Some rushed to help, tried to open the doors and help the victims, while some of them took pictures. Airbags were deployed.[19] Police arrived on scene around 10 minutes after the crash at 00:30 and an ambulance was on site five minutes after the police, according to witnesses.[19] France Info radio reported that one photographer was beaten by witnesses who were horrified by the scene.[12] Five of the photographers were taken into custody.[17] Later, two others were detained and around 20 rolls of film were taken from the photographers.[12] Police also impounded their vehicles.[12] Firemen also arrived to help remove the victims.[20]  Still conscious, Rees-Jones had suffered multiple serious facial injuries and a head contusion.[21] The front occupants\\' airbags had functioned normally.[22] The occupants were not wearing seat belts.[a] Diana, who had been sitting in the right rear passenger seat, was still conscious. Critically injured, Diana was reported to murmur repeatedly, \"Oh my God,\" and after the photographers and other helpers were pushed away by police, \"Leave me alone.\"[23] In June 2007 the Channel 4 documentary Diana: The Witnesses in the Tunnel claimed that the first person to touch Diana was Dr. Maillez,[24] who chanced upon the scene. He reported that Diana had no visible injuries but was in shock. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00 am. She then went into cardiac arrest and following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again.[26] She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18 am, left the scene at 1:41 am and arrived at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital at 2:06 am.[27]  Fayed had been sitting in the left rear passenger seat and was shortly afterwards pronounced dead.[28] Paul was declared dead on removal from the wreckage. Both were taken to the Institut Médico-Légal (IML), the Paris mortuary, not to a hospital. Paul was later found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.175 grams per 100 mL of blood - about 3.5 times the legal limit in France.[21]  Despite attempts to save her, Diana\\'s internal injuries were too extensive: her heart had been displaced to the right side of the chest, which tore the pulmonary vein and the pericardium. Despite lengthy resuscitation attempts, including internal cardiac massage, she died at 4:00 a.m.[31] Anesthesiologist Bruno Riou announced her death at 6 am at a news conference held at the hospital.[17][32]  Later that morning, Jean-Pierre Chevènement (French Minister of the Interior) visited the hospital with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.[33] At around 5:00 pm, Diana\\'s former husband, Charles, Prince of Wales, and her two older sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, arrived in Paris. The group visited the hospital along with French President Jacques Chirac and thanked the doctors for trying to save her life.[35] Prince Charles accompanied Diana\\'s body home on Sunday.[36] Her body was taken to the Hammersmith and Fulham mortuary in London for its autopsy later that day.[37]  Initial media reports stated Diana\\'s car had collided with the pillar at 190 km/h (120 mph), and that the speedometer\\'s needle had jammed at that position.[21] It was later announced the car\\'s speed on collision was about 95–110 km/h (60–70 mph). The car was certainly travelling much faster than the speed limit of 50 km/h (31 mph). In 1999, a French investigation concluded the Mercedes had come into contact with another vehicle (a white Fiat Uno) in the tunnel.[38] The driver of that vehicle has never been conclusively traced, although many believe the driver of the Fiat was Le Van Thanh but the specific vehicle has not been identified.[39] [38]  It was remarked by Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, that if the accident had been caused in part by being hounded by paparazzi, that it would be \"doubly tragic.\"[10] Diana\\'s brother also blamed tabloid media for her death.[40] An 18-month French judicial investigation concluded in 1999 that the crash was caused by Paul, who lost control at high speed while intoxicated.[41]  Mourning [ edit ]  Members of the public were invited to sign a book of condolence at St. James Palace.[42] All 11,000 light bulbs at Harrods were turned off and not switched on again until after the funeral.[42] Throughout the night, members of the Women\\'s Royal Voluntary Service and the Salvation Army provided support for people queuing along the Mall.[43] More than one million bouquets were left at her London home, Kensington Palace,[44] while at her family\\'s estate of Althorp the public was asked to stop bringing flowers as the volume of people and flowers in the surrounding roads was said to be causing a threat to public safety.[45]  By 10 September, the pile of flowers outside Kensington Gardens was 5 feet (1.5 m) deep in places and the bottom layer had started to compost.[46] The people were quiet, queuing patiently to sign the book and leave their gifts. There were a few minor incidents. Fabio Piras, a Sardinian tourist, was given a one-week prison sentence on 10 September for having taken a teddy bear from the pile. When the sentence was later reduced to a £100 fine, Piras was punched in the face by a member of the public when he left the court.[47] The next day two Slovakian tourists, Maria Rigolova, a 54-year-old secondary school teacher and Agnese Sihelksa, a 50-year-old communications technician, were each given a 28-day prison sentence for having taken 11 teddy bears and a number of flowers from the pile outside the palace.[48] This was reduced to a fine of £200 each.[49]  Funeral [ edit ]  Early on, it was uncertain if it would be a state funeral since Diana had lost her royal status because of her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.[50]  Diana\\'s death was met with extraordinary public expressions of grief, and her funeral at Westminster Abbey on 6 September drew an estimated 3 million mourners and onlookers in London,[51][52] and worldwide television coverage watched by 2.5 billion people.[53] It was aired to 200 countries in 44 languages.[54] Outside the Abbey and in Hyde Park crowds watched and listened to proceedings on large outdoor screens and speakers as guests filed in, including representatives of the many charities of which Diana was patron. Attendants included US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Bernadette Chirac, wife of the French President, Jacques Chirac and other celebrities, including Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and friends of Diana, George Michael and Elton John.[23][55] John performed a rewritten version of his song \"Candle in the Wind\" that was dedicated to her.[56] Protocol was disregarded when the guests applauded the speech by Diana\\'s younger brother Earl Spencer, who strongly criticised the press and indirectly criticised the Royal Family for their treatment of her.[57] The funeral is estimated to have been watched by 31.5 million viewers in Britain. Precise calculation of the worldwide audience is not possible, but estimated at around 2.5 billion.[58]  After the end of the ceremony, the coffin was driven to Althorp in a Daimler hearse.[59] Mourners cast flowers at the funeral procession for almost the entire length of its journey and vehicles even stopped on the opposite carriageway of the M1 motorway as the cars passed.[60]  In a private ceremony, Diana was buried on an island in the middle of a lake called The Oval, which is part of the Pleasure Garden at Althorp.[61] In her coffin, she wore a black Catherine Walker dress and is clutching a rosary in her hands. The rosary had been a gift from Mother Teresa of Calcutta, a confidante of Diana, who had died the day before her funeral. A visitors\\' centre is open during summer months, with an exhibition about her and a walk around the lake. All profits are donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.[62]  Reactions [ edit ]  Some criticised the reaction to Diana\\'s death at the time as being \"hysterical\" and \"irrational\". As early as 1998 philosopher Anthony O\\'Hear identified the mourning as a defining point in the \"sentimentalisation of Britain\", a media-fuelled phenomenon where image and reality become blurred.[63] Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher responded to the reaction with \"The woman\\'s dead. Shut up. Get over it\".[64] These criticisms were repeated on the 10th anniversary, when journalist Jonathan Freedland expressed the opinion that \"It has become an embarrassing memory, like a mawkish, self-pitying teenage entry in a diary ... we cringe to think about it.\" In 2010, Theodore Dalrymple suggested \"sentimentality, both spontaneous and generated by the exaggerated attention of the media, that was necessary to turn the death of the princess into an event of such magnitude thus served a political purpose, one that was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself\".[65] Some cultural analysts disagreed. Sociologist Deborah Steinberg pointed out that many Britons associated Diana not with the Royal Family but with social change and a more liberal society: \"I don\\'t think it was hysteria, the loss of a public figure can be a touchstone for other issues.\"[66] Carol Wallace of People Magazine said that the fascination with Diana\\'s death had to do with \"the fairy tale failing to end happily – twice, first when she got divorced and now that she died.\"[67]  Royal family [ edit ]  The Queen expressed her dismay at Diana\\'s death when she found out.[68] Prince Charles was the person who told their sons about their mother\\'s death.[68] The princes were told of her death before dawn, as Prince Charles had to wake them up to share the tragic news.[69] The boys were close to their mother.[69] On Sunday morning after Diana\\'s death, Queen Elizabeth, Princes Charles, William and Harry all wore black to church services at Balmoral Castle.[70] Prince Charles, William and Harry would be coming back to London on Friday, September 5.[71] The Queen, who returned to London from Balmoral, agreed to a television broadcast to the nation.[72]  The Royal Family was criticised for a rigid adherence to protocol, and their concern to care for Diana\\'s grieving sons, was interpreted as a lack of compassion.[73] In particular, the refusal of Buckingham Palace to fly the Royal Standard at half-mast provoked angry headlines in newspapers.[73][74] \"Where is our Queen? Where is her Flag?\" asked The Sun.[72] The Palace\\'s stance was one of royal protocol: no flag could fly over Buckingham Palace, as the Royal Standard is only flown when the Queen is in residence, and the Queen was then in Scotland. The Royal Standard never flies at half-mast as it is the Sovereign\\'s flag and there is never an interregnum or vacancy in the monarchy, as the new monarch immediately succeeds his or her predecessor. Finally, as a compromise, the Union Flag was flown at half-mast as the Queen left for Westminster Abbey on the day of the funeral.[72] This set a precedent, and Buckingham Palace has subsequently flown the Union Flag when the Queen is not in residence.[75] A rift between Prince Charles and the Queen\\'s private secretary Sir Robert Fellowes (Diana\\'s brother-in-law) was reported in the media over what the nature of the Princess\\'s funeral should be with Charles demanding a public funeral and Fellowes supporting the Queen\\'s idea of a private one.[76] The Palace later issued a statement denying such rumours.[76]  Prince Harry said in 2017 that the death of his mother caused severe depression and grief.[77] Prince William was 15 and Harry was 12 when Diana died.[78]  Politicians\\' reactions [ edit ]  President Bill Clinton\\'s remarks on Diana\\'s death  British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said that he \"felt utterly devastated by the death of the Princess.\"[50] President Bill Clinton said that he and his wife, Hillary Clinton were \"profoundly saddened\" when they found out about her death.[17] Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General said that her death \"has robbed the world of a consistent and committed voice for the improvement of the lives of suffering children worldwide.\"[70] In Australia, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, condemned the paparazzi for their overzealous coverage of Diana.[79] Russian President Boris Yeltsin praised Diana\\'s charity work in a statement saying \"All know of Princess Diana\\'s big contribution to charitable work, and not only in Great Britain\".[80][81] Among other politicians who sent messages of condolences were South African President Nelson Mandela, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[80]  Public reactions [ edit ]  In London, thousands of people carried bouquets and stood outside of Buckingham Palace after the news of her death.[70] People started bringing flowers within an hour after the news was shared.[68] The BBC flew its flags at half-mast.[70] Both radio and television aired the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen,\" in response to Diana\\'s death.[68]  People in the United States were shocked at her death.[82] In Paris, thousands of people visited the site of the crash and the hospital where Diana died.[83] People brought flowers and also attempted to visit the Hotel Ritz, as well.[83] In Bosnia, a land-mine survivor, Jasminko Bjelic, who had met Diana only three weeks earlier, said, \"She was our friend.\"[70] Following her death many celebrities including actors and singers blamed the paparazzi and condemned their reckless behavior.[84][85]  During the four weeks following her funeral, the suicide rate in England and Wales rose by 17% and cases of deliberate self-harm by 44.3% compared with the average for that period in the four previous years. Researchers suggest that this was caused by the \"identification\" effect, as the greatest increase in suicides was by people most similar to Diana: women aged 25 to 44, whose suicide rate increased by over 45%.[86] Another research showed that 50% of Britons and 27% of Americans were deeply affected by her death as if someone they knew had died. It also concluded that in general women were more affected than men in both of the countries.[87] The same research showed that Diana\\'s \"charitable endeavors\" and \"ability to identify with ordinary people\" were among the main factors that caused her to be admired and respected by the people.[87] In the weeks after her death counselling services reported an increase in the number of phone calls by the people who were seeking help due to grief or distress.[88]  The national grieving for Diana had economic effects. In the short term, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) estimated that retail sales dropped 1% that week. Traffic congestion in central London as crowds went to the palaces to pay homage likewise adversely affected productivity, and the CEBR estimated that would cost businesses £200 million, or a total loss of 0.1% of gross domestic product for the third quarter of 1997. However, in the long run the CEBR expected that to be offset by increased tourism and memorabilia sales.[89]  Memorials [ edit ]  Flame of Liberty, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France The, the unofficial Diana memorial in Paris, France  In the years after her death, interest in the life of Diana has remained high. As a temporary memorial, the public co-opted the Flamme de la Liberté (Flame of Liberty), a monument near the Alma Tunnel related to the French donation of the Statue of Liberty to the United States. The messages of condolence have since been removed and its use as a Diana memorial has discontinued, though visitors still leave messages in her memory. A permanent memorial, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, was opened by the Queen in Hyde Park in London on 6 July 2004.[90]  Inquests [ edit ]  Under English law, an inquest is required in cases of sudden or unexplained death.[91][92] A French judicial investigation had already been carried out but the 6,000-page report was never published.[93] On 6 January 2004, six years after her death, an inquest into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened in London held by Michael Burgess, the coroner of the Queen\\'s household.[92] The coroner asked the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to make inquiries, in response to speculation that the deaths were not an accident.[92][94] The police investigation reported its findings in Operation Paget in December 2006.[95]  In January 2006, Lord Stevens explained in an interview on GMTV that the case is substantially more complex than once thought. The Sunday Times wrote on 29 January 2006 that agents of the British secret service were cross-examined because they were in Paris at the time of the crash. It was suggested in many journals that these agents might have exchanged the blood test of the driver with another blood sample (although no evidence for this has been forthcoming).[96][97]  The inquests into the deaths of Diana and Fayed opened on 8 January 2007, with Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss acting as Deputy Coroner of the Queen\\'s Household for the Diana inquest and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey in relation to the Fayed inquest. Butler-Sloss originally intended to sit without a jury;[98] this decision was later overturned by the High Court,[99] as well as the jurisdiction of the Coroner of the Queen\\'s Household. On 24 April 2007, Butler-Sloss stepped down, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury.[100] The role of Coroner for the inquests was transferred to Lord Justice Scott Baker, who formally took up the role on 13 June as Coroner for Inner West London.[101]  On 27 July 2007, Baker, following representations for the lawyers of the interested parties, issued a list of issues likely to be raised at the inquest, many of which had been dealt with in great detail by Operation Paget:  Whether driver error on the part of Henri Paul caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether Henri Paul\\'s ability to drive was impaired through drink or drugs Whether a Fiat Uno or any other vehicle caused or contributed to the collision Whether the actions of the Paparazzi caused or contributed to the cause of the collision Whether the road/tunnel layout and construction were inherently dangerous and, if so, whether this contributed to the collision Whether any bright/flashing lights contributed to or caused the collision and, if so, their source Whose decision it was that the Princess of Wales and Dodi Al Fayed should leave from the rear entrance to the Ritz and that Henri Paul should drive the vehicle Henri Paul\\'s movements between 7 and 10 pm on 30 August 1997 The explanation for the money in Henri Paul\\'s possession on 30 August 1997 and in his bank account Whether Andanson was in Paris on the night of the collision Whether Diana\\'s life would have been saved if she had reached hospital sooner or if her medical treatment had been different Whether Diana was pregnant Whether Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were about to announce their engagement Whether and, if so in what circumstances, the Princess of Wales feared for her life The circumstances relating to the purchase of the ring The circumstances in which Diana\\'s body was embalmed Whether the evidence of Tomlinson throws any light on the collision Whether the British or any other security services had any involvement in the collision Whether there was anything sinister about (i) the Cherruault burglary or (ii) the disturbance at the Big Pictures agency Whether correspondence belonging to the Princess of Wales (including some from Prince Philip) has disappeared, and if so the circumstances.[102]  The inquests officially began on 2 October 2007 with the swearing of a jury of six women and five men. Scott Baker delivered a lengthy opening statement giving general instructions to the jury and introducing the evidence.[103] The BBC reported that Mohamed Al-Fayed, having earlier reiterated his claim that his son and Diana were murdered by the Royal Family, immediately criticised the opening statement as biased.[104]  The inquest heard evidence from people connected with Diana and the events leading to her death, including Paul Burrell, Mohamed Al-Fayed, her stepmother, the survivor of the crash, and the former head of MI5.[105]  Scott Baker began his summing up to the jury on 31 March 2008.[106] He opened by telling the jury \"no-one except you and I and, I think, the gentleman in the public gallery with Diana and Fayed painted on his forehead sat through every word of evidence\" and concluded that there was \"not a shred of evidence\" that Diana\\'s death had been ordered by the Duke of Edinburgh or organised by the security services.[107] Lord Justice Scott Baker concluded his summing up on Wednesday, 2 April 2008.[108] After summing up, the jury retired to consider five verdicts, namely unlawful killing by the negligence of either or both the following vehicles or Paul; accidental death or an open verdict.[106] The jury decided on 7 April 2008 that Diana had been unlawfully killed by the following vehicles.[109][110] Princes William and Harry released a statement in which they said that they \"agree with their verdicts and are both hugely grateful.\"[111] Mohamed Al Fayed also said that he would accept the verdict and \"abandon his 10-year campaign to prove that Diana and Dodi were murdered in a conspiracy\".[112]  The cost of the inquiry exceeded £12.5 million, with the coroner\\'s inquest at £4.5 million, and a further £8 million spent on the Metropolitan Police investigation. It lasted 6 months and heard 250 witnesses, with the cost heavily criticised in the media.[113]  Related lawsuits [ edit ]  Nine photographers who had been following Diana and Dodi in 1997, were charged with manslaughter in France.[114] France\\'s \"highest court\" dropped the charges in 2002.[114]  Three photographers who took pictures of the aftermath of the crash on 31 August 1997 had their photographs confiscated and were tried for invasion of privacy for taking pictures through the open door of the crashed car.[114][115] The photographers, who were part of the \"paparazzi\" were acquitted in 2003.[114]  Conspiracy theories [ edit ]  Although the initial French investigation found that Diana had died as a result of an accident, several conspiracy theories have been raised.[116] Since February 1998, Fayed\\'s father, Mohamed Al-Fayed (the owner of the Hôtel Ritz, where Paul worked, and thus potentially liable for wrongful death liability) has claimed that the crash was a result of a conspiracy,[117] and later contended that the crash was orchestrated by MI6 on the instructions of the Royal Family.[118] His claims were dismissed by a French judicial investigation[2] and by Operation Paget, a Metropolitan Police Service inquiry that concluded in 2006.[119] An inquest headed by Lord Justice Scott Baker into the deaths of Diana and Fayed began at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, on 2 October 2007, a continuation of the inquest that began in 2004.[100] On 7 April 2008, the jury concluded that Diana and Fayed were the victims of an \"unlawful killing\" by the \"grossly negligent\" chauffeur Paul and the drivers of the following vehicles.[120] Additional factors were \"the impairment of the judgment of the driver of the Mercedes through alcohol\" and \"the death of the deceased was caused or contributed to by the fact that the deceased was not wearing a seat belt, the fact that the Mercedes struck the pillar in the Alma Tunnel rather than colliding with something else\".[109]  On 17 August 2013, Scotland Yard revealed that they were examining the credibility of information from a source that alleged that Diana was murdered by a member of the British military.[121][122]  In the media [ edit ]  After Dark television discussion - \"After Diana\" - broadcast on A specialtelevision discussion - \"After Diana\" - broadcast on Channel 4 on 13 September 1997  Actor George Clooney publicly lambasted several tabloids and paparazzi agencies following Diana\\'s death. A few of the tabloids boycotted Clooney following the outburst, stating that he \"owed a fair portion of his celebrity\" to the tabloids and photo agencies in question.[123]  Diana was ranked third in the 2002 Great Britons poll sponsored by the BBC and voted for by the British public, after Sir Winston Churchill (1st) (a distant cousin), and Isambard Kingdom Brunel (2nd), just above Charles Darwin (4th), William Shakespeare (5th), and Isaac Newton (6th). That same year, another British poll named Diana\\'s death as the most important event in the country\\'s last 100 years.[124] Historian Nick Barrett criticised this outcome as being \"a pretty shocking result\".[125]  Later in 2004, US TV network CBS showed pictures of the crash scene in one of its programmes which were \"part of a 4,000-page French government report.\" It showed an intact rear side and centre section of the Mercedes, including one of an unbloodied Diana with no outward injuries crouched on the rear floor with her back to the right passenger seat—the right rear door is fully open. The release of these pictures were poorly received in the UK, where it was felt that the privacy of Diana was being infringed.[126] Buckingham Palace, UK Prime Minister and Diana\\'s brother condemned the action, while CBS defended its decision saying that the pictures \"are placed in journalistic context - an examination of the medical treatment given to Princess Diana just after the crash.\"[127]  On 13 July 2006, Italian magazine Chi published photographs that showed Diana amid the wreckage of the car crash;[128] the photos were released despite an unofficial blackout on such photographs being published.[129][b] The editor of Chi defended his decision by saying he published the photographs simply because they had not been previously seen, and he felt the images were not disrespectful to the memory of Diana.[129]  The British newspaper The Daily Express has been criticised for continued and sustained coverage of Princess Diana following her death. A 2006 report in The Guardian showed that the newspaper had mentioned her in numerous recent news stories, with headlines including \"Perhaps Diana should have worn seatbelt\", \"Diana inquiry chief\\'s laptop secrets stolen\", \"£250,000 a year bill to run Diana fountain\" and \"Diana seatbelt sabotage probe\".[130]  Internet coverage [ edit ]  Diana\\'s death occurred at a time when Internet use in the developed world was booming, and several national newspapers and at least one British regional newspaper had already launched online news services. BBC News had set up online coverage of the general election earlier in 1997[131] and as a result of the widespread public and media attention that Diana\\'s death resulted in, BBC News swiftly created a website featuring news coverage of Diana\\'s death and the events that followed it. Diana\\'s death helped BBC News officials realise how important online news services were becoming, and a full online news service was launched on 4 November that year, alongside the launch of the BBC\\'s rolling news channel BBC News 24 on 9 November.[132]  See also [ edit ]  References [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Although there are conflicting reports (such as BBC and CNN ), the investigation Operation Paget report notes \"Operation Paget\\'s view is that none of the seat belts were being worn at the time of the impact, including that of Trevor Rees-Jones.\" (Page 421) [1] ^ The photographs, taken minutes after the accident, show her slumped in the back seat while a paramedic attempts to fit an oxygen mask over her face.

       " 'Kelly Clarkson will join NBC’s “The Voice” as a coach for season 14, Variety has learned.  The pop star and season-one “American Idol” champion will join longtime coaches Blake Shelton and Adam Levine for the NBC talent-competition series’ spring 2018 cycle. A fourth coach for the season has not yet been set. Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus are already confirmed to be joining regulars Levine and Shelton this fall for the show’s 13th season.  Clarkson had been in long-simmering talks about possibly joining “The Voice” for an upcoming season. She was approached by the show multiple times in the past and had expressed interest, but had been unable to work its production cycle into her schedule.  Both Clarkson and Shelton are represented by Narvel Blackstock’s Starstruck Entertainment.  Clarkson had been approached in recent weeks to join “American Idol” as judge for its upcoming relaunch on ABC. The deal with “The Voice” scuttles any possible return to “Idol” for Clarkson, who was the winner of the talent competition’s first season in 2002 and appeared as a guest judge during the show’s 15th and final season on Fox.  Related ‘American Idol’: Ryan Seacrest in Advanced Talks to Return as Host for ABC Revival (EXCLUSIVE)  With season 14 of “The Voice” set to premiere in February, Clarkson will likely be spinning her chair at NBC at the same time that ABC’s “Idol,” expected to debut in March, is getting off the ground. The two shows could even find themselves going head-to-head. ABC has committed to roughly 40 hours of “Idol,” making it highly likely that the show will air two nights a week, as it did on Fox. According to sources, ABC is eyeing Sunday as one of those nights. The end of the spring cycle of “The Bachelor” in mid-March would open up Monday evenings for an hour-long weekly “Idol” results show. There it could face NBC’s regular 8-10 p.m. episode of “The Voice.”  In addition to being the first “Idol” champion, Clarkson is also one of its most distinguished alums, having risen to pop-star status on the strength of singles such as “Since U Been Gone.” Clarkson was also a judge on ABC’s short-lived singing competition “Duets.” In addition to manager Blackstock, she is represented by CAA.  “I’m so excited to join ‘The Voice’ at NBC,” Clarkson said. “We’ve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn’t been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can’t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they’ve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I’m comin’ to win!!”  “Kelly has been a part of ‘The Voice’ family for many years as an adviser and performer. We are thrilled she has chosen to join us as a coach to mentor the next generation through our unique vocal boot camp,” said Paul Telegdy, president, alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. “Every time Kelly Clarkson sings you are reminded what an incredible voice really is. We are looking forward to the sound of Kelly Clarkson on ‘The Voice.’”',\n",

       " 'Survivor player Zeke Smith is a welcome shot of enthusiastic, wickedly smart energy on the show. He proved to be a sly force of nature throughout season 33’s Millennials vs. Gen X edition, winning allies with savvy gameplay and a wide grin. And on season 34’s Game Changers — which is currently airing and pits some of Survivor’s most interesting experienced players against one another — Zeke has been strategic, focused, and giddy as hell to be playing a game he loves with players he’s watched for years.  Zeke is also transgender. But this isn’t a fact that you, or I, or anyone outside the people he’s revealed it to would know if it weren’t for Survivor’s April 12 episode, during which a member of Zeke’s tribe outed him in a moment of vindictive desperation — while simultaneously declaring that Zeke was being deceptive by not revealing his transgender status.  Survivor has been a surprisingly astute study of personal politics since it premiered on CBS nearly two decades ago, in 2000. (I mean, watching people do puzzles in the jungle is fun, but it’s not “34 seasons and counting” levels of fun.) When pushed to their physical edges and worn down to their rawest nerves, people tend to either fall back (almost gratefully) into what a script would have them do or turn around and surprise you.  This episode was definitely a surprise — but in more ways than that first nasty moment. The way Zeke was outed furthered a pernicious misconception, the kind that puts transgender people in real danger every day. But by the end of the hour, there was, incredibly, more reason to be hopeful about the way trans people are seen and represented than before.  Zeke was outed when a fellow player got desperate and made a reprehensible decision  For a while, “What Happened on Exile Stays on Exile” was about as typical an episode of Survivor as any other episode that’s aired this season. One tribe won pizza; the other had a tearful conversation around a campfire. When Zeke’s tribe failed to spell “metamorphosis” in a word jumble during the final challenge, they were put in the unfortunate position of having to vote someone out during Tribal Council. The obvious pick was Jeff Varner, since Varner’s only ally was voted off the show last week. And Varner knew it, especially once Zeke — a new friend — told him frankly that his chances weren’t looking good.  Survivor contestants usually try to pull a few Hail Marys once they realize they’re circling the drain. But for Varner, feeling the pinch of possible elimination, that apparently involved any strategy he could come up with to torpedo Zeke’s ironclad alliance with the rest of the tribe.  “Zeke’s not being truthful,” Varner insisted to the camera. “I know something about Zeke that none of them know. ... This is not the guy you think he is.”  It sounds like typical Survivor talk. But these statements take on a whole new, and horrifying, context in light of what Varner did at Tribal Council. After his first pitch to make everyone turn on a fellow tribe member flopped, he said, “There’s more.” He then turned to Zeke and said, point blank, “Why haven’t you told anyone you’re transgender?”  “What I’m showing here,” Varner continued as Zeke and his teammates blinked, “is a deception.”  Zeke, in a remarkably candid piece for the Hollywood Reporter, writes that he was too shocked to react at first. He and the Survivor producers had apparently talked about the possibility that him being transgender might come up, but according to Survivor host and producer Jeff Probst, they agreed that “if his story was to be told, he would be the one to decide when, where, and how.”  (For those wondering if this episode falls into that category, it’s not clear if Zeke would have — or could have — preferred to keep this episode off the air. According to GLAAD, its Transgender Media Program worked with CBS and Zeke “for several months to ensure that when the episode aired, Zeke would have the opportunity to speak for himself about his experience.”)  A longtime Survivor obsessive, Zeke wrote for THR that he just wanted the chance to play as Zeke, a guy with a knack for strategy and thinking three steps ahead. “I didn’t discuss my trans status in my initial [audition] video,” he writes, “because I wanted the show to desire me as a game player and an eccentric storyteller, not as ‘The First Trans Survivor Player.’”  The show seemed to respect that — but one of its contestants didn’t.  And now, a quick reminder of why calling trans people “deceptive” is such a dangerous thing to do  As Zeke’s teammates rose up to call out Varner during Tribal Council (more on that in a minute), Debbie Wanner declared that Zeke not disclosing that he’s transgender “isn’t deceiving us strategically in a game.”  And in a reply I hope Varner truly regrets, he doubled down by insisting that it “reveals the ability to deceive.”  Let’s be very clear: Saying that trans people are inherently deceptive feeds into one of the most poisonous misconceptions about what it means to be transgender. It paints trans people as liars who are willfully misleading innocents astray, when they’re just people trying to live their lives. It invalidates their identities and experiences in a way that makes them more vulnerable to discrimination and assault.  It is, in other words, an extraordinarily shitty thing to do to someone, even if you don’t consider him a friend, as Varner appeared to think of Zeke.  By all accounts, Varner deeply regrets what he did. And Zeke has acknowledged that he can forgive Varner’s mistake. But he also admits that he probably can’t forget the toxicity of Varner’s words. As he wrote for THR:  In proclaiming “Zeke is not the guy you think he is” and that “there is deception on levels y’all don’t understand,” Varner is saying that I’m not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick. In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self — as is every other transgender person going about their daily lives.  In fact, as Zeke put it to People, Varner’s entire strategy hinged on painting trans people as liars. “That reasoning is infinitely worse than him outing me because it’s the same one used to discriminate against, attack and murder trans people,” Zeke said. “What’s great is that nobody bought it.”  If there’s anything encouraging about this disaster, it’s what Zeke and his competitors did next  In the moments after Varner outed Zeke, everyone else who was present — including host Jeff Probst — was taken aback. They were not, however, confused.  In a swarm of immediate and furious disgust, a few phrases kept jumping out: “You didn’t have to do that.” “That’s personal.” “That’s wrong of you to do that.”  Immediately, what could have been nothing more than a cruel televised outing became something else entirely: an unequivocal shutdown of unfounded anti-trans rhetoric on national television, and on a landmark network reality show at that.  Varner, scrambling, first defended his reasoning with the aforementioned “ability to deceive” nonsense, only to have Probst fire back that Varner was taking “a giant leap of logic.” When Varner then tried to save face by reminding everyone he was just trying to win a million dollars, contestant Tai Trang exclaimed in horror, “[By] outing somebody?!”  Nothing Varner tried could get anyone around him to mince words. Fan favorite Ozzy Lusth — who’s now on his fourth round of Survivor with Game Changers — told Varner he should be “ashamed ... of what [he’s] willing to do,” adding that he was “playing with people’s lives at this point.”  Eventually, Varner began to fall all over himself apologizing, saying he thought Zeke was “out and loud and proud.” But Varner and Zeke’s teammate Sarah Lacina wasn’t buying it, delivering a truly impressive eye roll and calling Varner’s tactic “a malicious attack.” She then stumbled into a moment that took even her by surprise. “I’m from the Midwest,” she said. “I come from a very conservative background, so it’s not very diverse ... [and] the fact that I can love this guy so much, and it doesn’t change anything for me, makes me realize that I’ve grown huge as a person.”  To be honest — and a little depressing — the speed and ferocity of these responses were almost as surprising to me as the outing itself. Everyone immediately seemed to recognize that Varner had screwed up; everyone immediately jumped to Zeke’s defense.  In fact, when it was time to vote, Probst didn’t even bother going through with the ceremony of it all. He just called up Varner to snuff out his torch, and that was that. For Varner, and for millions of viewers, the message was clear: Survivor might be a cutthroat game, but he had still managed to cross an unacceptable line.  Zeke, for his part, was as composed as his teammates were incensed. He explained that he’d chosen not to divulge this part of his life because “when people know that about you ... it sort of overwhelms everything else that they know about you.”  But he steeled his jaw and continued, saying he knew there was always a risk that something like this might happen and that he’s prepared to handle whatever comes next. “It’s kind of crappy the way it’s happened,” he said, “but if ‘metamorphosis’ is the word of the episode ... I am a changed, stronger, better man today.”  No one can argue with that statement. Zeke has impressed everyone from his teammates to viewers to Probst with his daring and generosity. That he managed to respond to such offhand cruelty with firm resolve and even grace speaks to the extraordinary strength of character his teammates leaped to defend. This one moment won’t — and shouldn’t — define him.  Survivor: Game Changers airs Wednesdays at 8 pm on CBS.',\n",

Getty Images Steve Granitz  I mean, I know it\\'s the last show of the season, but Cannon seems to be taking the phrase \"That\\'s a wrap\" literally.  Getty Images Steve Granitz  He is giving us \"Grandmother of the Church on Easter Sunday all dressed up for dinner at Golden Corral\" with just a hint of \"Punjab from the movie Annie but not really because although we love Geoffrey Holder we recognize there are some issues with this character.\" It\\'s...a lot. And, like Sally Field at the end of Steel Magnolias, I want to know why.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  You might think, Oh, this is just a wacky one-off. Some rogue stylist made a bold choice and Nick is just trying to downplay it. Out here like Daniel Bedingfield, muttering \"Gotta get through this...\" to himself. But, the gag is, he seems to be aware he\\'s wearing a turban. And he wants you to know about it, too.  Getty Images Steve Granitz  First of all, Mother Cannon, I\\'m unclear about why you are pointing to the turban, as if our attention could be anywhere else. It is literally being held together by the North Star; we noticed.  Of course, Cannon has a propensity for pointing, even when it\\'s not necessary. Take this photo from Red Nose Day:  Getty Images NBC  Photographer: Can you wear the nose, please?  Mother Cannon: I am wearing it.  Photographer: Yes, but it\\'s supposed to go on your face. Like an actual nose.  Mother Cannon: I know. But this here is a nose finger. It\\'s comedy. Ask about it. And I\\'m pointing to it so people know that this here is the joke. The nose finger. Scratch and sniff? Finger nose. Finger Cannon! I\\'m workshopping here. Is this too on the...what\\'s the word I\\'m looking for?  Photographer: Nose?  Mother Cannon: Finger.  So, if you\\'re taking notes at home for your Nick Cannon fashion journal, he sniffs at red noses but will turn up for a turban. And it\\'s not a new development.

The Fresh Prince scaled a bridge in the Hungarian capital to show off his moves to Drake’s track, a dance craze started by comedian Shoker last month.  In the video posted on his Instagram page, Smith admitted: “There’s no way…no way this is legal,” as he made his way to the very top of the bridge and copied the moves.  At the end, he said: “I woke up this morning in my feelings and I was like, ‘I got to let them out!”  Smith captioned the post: “Last day in Budapest. I woke up #InMyFeelings  “I’ma Keep It 100.. I was TERRIFIED up there. That’s why my dance moves is all STIFF!

Drake commented: “Wow the video is done.”  The Suicide Squad actor is one of many famous faces to take on the latest dance social media sensation since its inception.  Pop sensation Ciara, comedian Kevin Hart and even Drake have recreated the dance, sweeping the Internet much like the Mannequin challenge.

       " 'Our hearts are breaking for Teen Mom 3 alum Mackenzie McKee. Her beloved mom Angie Douthit was diagnosed with brain cancer back in January, but things were looking better in March. Mack then revealed in May that her mother\\'s cancer was spreading. \"You don’t deserve this, none of it. So happy, so healthy, and so faithful to God. Stage four cancer in your lungs, in your brain, and now in your bones,\" the reality star wrote.  Now, in an emotional post, Angie described what her “new journey” with IV chemotherapy will bring. “This morning we leave at 7:30 to begin another new journey. IV chemo. I won’t have my first treatment until Monday. I have education and nutrition classes this morning then the port will be surgically placed,” the mother-of-four began. \"As I’ve shared before, I dread chemo. However, God revealed to me that if I never had to go through IV chemo I would never fully understand cancer.\"  Angie believes that by embracing her next chapter with cancer, she will be able to help others cope. “I will now completely have full knowledge of what cancer patients are talking about. I’m also going to get to meet some incredible people while I sit in that recliner for a few hours getting my drugs!” she wrote.  She concluded the post with some amazingly inspirational words. “Soak in every moment so you can use it to help others. Continue to smile and hug no matter how you might feel. Brighten someone\\'s day, even if your day may seem bleak. Ask a friend if they need anything. Show them love, compassion, and forgiveness. Share the love of God everywhere you go, no matter where it is. Be nice!”  Just two months earlier, things were looking up for Angie. \"It’s a good day, radiation and chemo are kicking this cancer\\'s butt!\" Angie\\'s doctor told her during a visit. According to Angie\\'s new scans, her brain tumors are continuing to shrink and one of the tumors in her lungs went from 7 centimeters to 2 centimeters. She also had \"hundreds\" of smaller tumors in her lungs, and because of the treatment, they are all now either inactive or gone completely. \"I will continue on the chemo pill and will have more scans in April and May,\" she revealed.  Angie\\'s daughter Mackenzie was hit pretty hard when she found out about her mom\\'s cancer diagnosis earlier this year. \"I’m devastated, I’m angry, I\\'m shook, I can’t breathe. You are everything. Please pray,\" Mackenzie wrote in the caption of a collage of photos showing her close relationship with her mom on Instagram. On Jan. 2, she revealed that her mom\\'s sickness was worse than they originally thought. \"All prayer warriors. Please pray for my mom. What we thought was bronchitis turned out to be three masses on her brain, one large one in her lung, and multiple blood clots. We are in shock and devastated. She has brain surgery tomorrow. I’m sick. I’m so sick and want to wake up,\" she wrote.  This is my mom threatening the doctors that she will call #TheGoodDoctor 💗💕 pic.twitter.com/1U6vc3qdoQ — Mackenzie McKee (@DouthitKenzie) January 3, 2018  The news was extra shocking considering how fit and active Angie is. In November, they actually competed in a diabetes awareness run together, and her mom blew her out of the water! \"Thanks, Mom, for always setting a good example of health and fitness in my life,\" Mackenzie gushed at the time.  Mackenzie mentioned how well her mom treats her body in an interview with Us Weekly. \"She is the healthiest person I know,\" she said. \"Eats healthier than me. Always organic. Doesn’t smoke, doesn’t drink, she is a school teacher so [she] has no money. She runs marathons and works out two to three times a day. This does not run in our family,\" she revealed.

       " 'There\\'s no other show that knows how to deliver drama quite like Grey\\'s Anatomy, and that\\'s just when the cameras are rolling. Even as the Shondaland series heads into its fourteenth season, Grey\\'s Anatomy has just as much drama off screen as it does on.  There are only two cast members from the original line-ups of interns still on Grey\\'s Anatomy: the eponymous Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Given the insanely high death rate at Seattle Grace, are you really surprised that there\\'s some wild stuff going on behind the scenes?  Why did T.R. Knight really leave the show? What scene did ABC force Shonda Rhimes to change in season 1? Which actor was the entire cast rumored to be resentful of? And did Shonda Rhimes actually kill off Derek because she didn\\'t like him?  Here are 15 Dark Behind-The-Scenes Secrets From Grey\\'s Anatomy You Had No Idea About. Let us know which ones surprised you the most!  15 Patrick Dempsey was terrified of Shonda Rhimes  When Patrick Dempsey first met Shonda Rhimes to discuss being a part of the show, he couldn\\'t help but notice the blank stare she gave him as everyone else in the room talked. He was completely terrified of her, and after that meeting, he said he was convinced she hated him. He was certain that it wasn\\'t going to work, and that he wouldn\\'t be a part of what was, at the time, an untitled drama about surgeons.  Luckily for him, the blank stare and lack of warmth wasn\\'t because Shonda Rhimes hated him. She was just trying to imagine how she could possibly write dialogue for such a \"dreamy\" actor. And thus, Derek Shepherd, aka McDreamy, was created. (That affection, according to rumors, couldn\\'t last forever. RIP, McDreamy.)  14 The network forced Shonda Rhimes to change an early scene  In the early days of Grey\\'s Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes received a lot of criticism from ABC. Reportedly, she was told to make several changes to her writing in the first season, including a scene with Alex Karev and Cristina Yang that was originally written for episode two, \"The First Cut is the Deepest\". The scene was supposed to show the two of them them racing around the hospital to see who could deliver the most bad news to patients in the shortest amount of time, only to be shamed by the last patient.  However, the network forced Rhimes to cut the scene from the episode because they felt it went too far. \"I think the term that was used to describe me to my face was, \\'If you think you\\'re funny, you\\'re sick,\\'\" Rhimes said. \"I was stunned.\" Instead, the new version of that scene shows Alex and Cristina racing to give out good news (and avoid getting too many hugs from patients).  13 Shonda Rhimes kept track of how often a network exec. cursed at her  Speaking of criticism, Shonda Rhimes has admitted to clashing with the network quite a bit in the first two seasons of Grey\\'s Anatomy. The Alex and Cristina scene was just one incident, and Rhimes struggled with how she could continue to revise her writing without changing the show entirely.  The head of ABC at the time, Steve McPherson, apparently said some pretty nasty things to Rhimes after about the fourth or fifth episode. \"He said really horrible things to me,\" she said. \"I literally started keeping a list of how many times he said a certain swear word to me. After that, I was like, \\'OK, we\\'re dead.\\'\"  Thankfully, the show wasn\\'t dead, and instead had a strong series premiere -- and is now heading into its fourteenth season.  12 Meredith was supposed to date Burke, but Ellen Pompeo refused  Seriously. Think about that one for a second. Can you imagine anything other than MerDer? Can you picture Meredith saying \"pick me, choose me, love me\" to anyone other than McDreamy himself? Well, things were almost very different.  Apparently, Shonda Rhimes wanted Meredith\\'s love interest to be Isaiah Washington\\'s Preston Burke rather than Patrick Dempsey\\'s Derek Shepherd. Ellen Pompeo, however, didn\\'t like that idea at all. Because she\\'s in an interracial relationship in real life, she didn\\'t want to also be in one on screen, because she felt it would \"hit too close to home.\"  Pompeo lobbied for MerDer to be the show\\'s big romance and instead, it was Cristina who fell for Burke, that is until he left her at the altar.  11 Isaiah Washington reportedly choked Patrick Dempsey on set  There seem to be several different versions of this story, but Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey definitely admitted to getting into a heated argument on set. They were in each other\\'s faces, yelling at each other, and one rumor has it that Washington had Dempsey by the throat. Either way, it was definitely a dramatic incident, and one that was apparently all about the work ethic on set.  The good news is that no one was hurt, and later, it\\'s said that the two were back to work with no problems. When Washington talked about the incident after that, he laughed that he had been so close to Dempsey that he could appreciate how blue his eyes were. Well, that\\'s nice!  10 Isaiah Washington used a homophobic slur and was fired  Speaking of the fight between Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey, Washington used a homophobic slur at some point in that exchange, and T.R. Knight, who played George O\\'Malley on the show, apparently felt that slur was directed at him. Now, since then, Knight has come out as a gay man, but at the time, that wasn\\'t case.  Washington apologized for using the word later, saying, “I can neither defend nor explain my behavior,” Washington said in a statement. “I can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues I obviously need to examine within my own soul, and I’ve asked for help.”  Still, he managed to use the word yet again and ultimately get himself fired from Grey\\'s Anatomy. So it\\'s no surprise that his guest appearance in season 10 was met with some controversy.  9 Katherine Heigl dissed the show\\'s writing  This one is pretty darn unbelievable. After having won the Emmy award for supporting actress on Grey\\'s Anatomy the year before, Katherine Heigl opted to remove her name from Emmy consideration in 2008. “I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination and in an effort to maintain the integrity of the academy organization, I withdrew my name from contention,” she said in a statement. “In addition, I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials.”  Surprising? Maybe not so much. Shonda Rhimes later opened up about the incident, saying, \"On some level it stung, and on some level I was not surprised,\" and \"When people show you who they are, believe them.\"  8 Why T.R. Knight left the show  Grey\\'s Anatomy has became known for killing off beloved characters and ripping our hearts out, and that trend started with the character of George O\\'Malley, who was tragically hit by a bus at the end of season 5. The real reason George was so tragically killed off? Because T.R. Knight decided he was ready to quit the show altogether.  The actor was reportedly unhappy that he wasn\\'t getting enough screen time. He also noted there was a \"breakdown of communication\" between himself and Shonda Rhimes, and he felt he no longer understood his character. Weirdly enough, George had enlisted in the military, which seemed like Rhimes\\' way of writing him off the show with an opening to return-- until he was brutally struck by a bus.  Knight actually made a recent return to Shondaland, though, appearing as Alice\\'s brother, Tommy, on The Catch.  7 The cast reportedly resented Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off.  Fans of Kate Walsh\\'s Addison Montgomery had to be thrilled about a spinoff revolving around the character, Private Practice. But the rest of the Grey\\'s Anatomy cast? Yeah, not so much.  The cast was rumored to be resentful of Kate Walsh for getting her own spin off, and they reportedly all gave her the cold shoulder once they heard the news. According to a source, “The rest of the cast seemed instantly resentful of (Walsh).\" The source also stated that, “They each thought they’d be the one chosen to get their own show, and now they’re giving Kate the cold shoulder.” And reportedly, Ellen Pompeo “seemed particularly peeved because she felt that, as the star, she should have been consulted.”  6 Why Erica Hahn was abruptly written off  Erica Hahn\\'s exit certainly didn\\'t offer any closure. She walked off to her car at the end of a shift, and that was that. We never saw her again. And in real life, the exit was nearly as abrupt.  Brooke Smith she got the news that she was being let go, she was told the upcoming episode was her last. That was that. Smith said she got the feeling that it wasn\\'t Rhimes\\' decision. It\\'s also rumored that the network was uncomfortable with the explicit nature of Erica and Callie\\'s relationship, though Rhimes later stated it wasn\\'t that at all: \"Brooke Smith was obviously not fired for playing a lesbian. Clearly it’s not an issue as we have a lesbian character on the show – Calliope Torres. Sara Ramirez is an incredible comedic and dramatic actress and we wanted to be able to play up her magic. Unfortunately, we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke’s character would sustain in the long run.\"  5 Shonda Rhimes: \"No Heigls\"  Shonda Rhimes isn\\'t someone you should mess around with. The showrunner has made it clear that after all the drama surrounding Grey\\'s Anatomy, including the Emmys disaster involving Katherine Heigl, she\\'s no longer going to tolerate anything of the sort.  When she was discussing her new show at the time, Scandal, starring Kerry Washington, Rhimes was very clear about her stance on on-set drama: “I don’t put up with bulls–t or nasty people. I don’t have time for it,\" she said. She also added, very specifically, \"There are no Heigls in this situation.\"  It\\'s also worth noting that Scandal main cast member Columbus Short (Harrison Wright) was let go from the show after drama in his personal life.  4 Fans started a petition to have Jesse Williams fired  After accepting BET\\'s Humanitarian Award in 2016, Jesse Williams gave an impassioned and inspiring speech about racism in our nation. That speech went viral, and it was also met with quite a bit of controversy. In fact, it was met with so much controversy that some fans started a petition to have Williams fired from Grey\\'s Anatomy.  The Change.org petition got 28,000 signatures, and stated that Williams\\' speech was \"a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people.\" It also called for fans to boycott ABC. The petition was never going to go anywhere, though, and Shonda Rhimes was quick to let people know it. She offered a simple Tweet that summed everything up, saying, \"Um, people? Boo don\\'t need a petition. #Shondalandrules\"  3 Surgery on set is gross  Surgery on Grey\\'s Anatomy is always difficult to watch, at least if you\\'re a relatively squeamish person. Well, here\\'s something to make it worse. Those surgeries are made to look realistic, and super gross, because of what\\'s actually being used.  A few examples? The show has been known to use cow organs and lamb brains, for starters. And for blood matter, they use a mixture of blood, chicken fat, and... Jello.  Sarah Drew, who plays April Kepner on the show, has even spoken out about how disgusting it is to work those things on set. In an interview, she stated, \"We work with Bovine organs, which is cow’s organs. The smell is repulsive and makes us all gag. And we use an actual soldering tool to solder the organs. It smells like burning flesh. There’s also a lot of silicone and blood matter – red jello mixed with blood and chicken fat. It’s pretty gross.\"  2 Katherine Heigl wants to return, but Shonda Rhimes shut it down  If you\\'re hoping for Izzy Stevens to return to Grey\\'s Anatomy at some point, you might have to keep waiting. In 2012, long after Katherine Heigl left the series, she admitted she had made mistakes and that she\\'d like to be able to return Grey\\'s Anatomy and wear her scrubs once again. However, Shonda Rhimes stated that wouldn\\'t be happening any time soon.  Rhimes said in an interview, \"I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. We are on a track we have been planning, and the idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.\"  However, anything could happen. There\\'s a reason Rhimes didn\\'t kill Izzie off, and in a different interview, Rhimes noted that she could be open to seeing Izzie again.  1 Why Derek Was Killed Off  Of all the characters to be killed off on Grey\\'s Anatomy, this one remains the most shocking and arguably the most heartbreaking. Who would have thought we\\'d see the day when Patrick Dempsey\\'s Derek Shepherd was no longer a part of the series?  There\\'s a lot of speculation as to why Dempsey left Grey\\'s Anatomy, and Shonda Rhimes admitted to killing off at least one character because she didn\\'t like the actor who played them. Now, she didn\\'t admit to who, but considering the timing of that admission, along with multiple rumors, it\\'s easy to assume she was referring to Patrick Dempsey in that statement.  Dempsey\\'s response? He said he believes Shonda Rhimes \"loves being provocative and that\\'s fine for who she is.\" Talk about passive aggressive!  ---  Which of these behind-the-secrets from Grey\\'s Anatomy surprises you the most?

       " \"Some stories are powerful enough to convince you that alternate universes really do exist. Take this one in The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that prior to becoming president of the United States, Donald Trump had signed on to play the president . . . in Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No. Somewhere out there, in a universe we’ll never know, Trump’s political aspirations peaked with a made-for-TV horror series, where he quickly got the POTUS bug out of his system after a few days on a film set where everyone called him “Mr. President.”  Alas, talks never materialized into a surefire contract, perhaps because Trump and his team handled the potential deal with their signature competence and finesse.  According to David Latt, the co-founder of Sharknado production company The Asylum, Trump said yes to playing the president almost immediately after The Asylum made the offer. “He was thrilled to be asked,” Latt tells T.H.R.  Funnily enough, Trump wasn’t even the first choice to play the lead politician. Producers initially had their hearts set on Sarah Palin, but negotiations fell apart. It was Ian Ziering, the Sharknado lead and former cast member on Celebrity Apprentice, who suggested Trump for the role.  Gerald Webb, the casting director, says talks got “pretty far.” The Sharknado team then sent a contract to Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen—whom you may be familiar with thanks to this viral interview, or headlines declaring him as yet another Trump-inner-circler who’s been pulled into the Russia investigations.  But all the serious talks soon went quiet, with Cohen later revealing to Latt that Trump was seriously considering running for president—and that now “might not be the best time” to pop up in a Sharknado film, despite Trump’s rich and varied history of schlocky cameos. Asylum eventually decided to give the role instead to billionaire Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban, who is also a noted Trump nemesis. The decision apparently infuriated Trump’s team.  “We immediately heard from Trump's lawyer,” Latt tells T.H.R. “He basically said, ‘How dare you? Donald wanted to do this. We’re going to sue you! We’re going to shut the entire show down!’” (For the record, Cohen tells T.H.R. he does not recall this particular exchange.) Despite the threat, Sharknado 3 premiered in July 2015 as planned—just over a month after Trump announced his candidacy.  Had Trump accepted the role, we would have been treated to such scenes as the current president of the United States shooting down flying sharks in the halls of the White House and shouting, “This is for America, baby!” Instead, another universe is enjoying another timeline—one in which Trump enjoyed his Sharknado presidency and moved on.

       " 'Gwen Stefani has always been a fashion risk taker. Whether it was dressing as a punky tomboy during her years as the frontwoman for No Doubt or embracing her love for Japanese fashion with Harajuku, Stefani has always found a way to stand out.  Recently, the rocker has been embracing her feminity, wearing things that recall old-school Hollywood glam, and that’s much to do with her relationship with country crooner Blake Shelton. During a conversation with supermodel Heidi Klum for InStyle, Stefani was asked to describe her current style.  “More feminine than ever before,” Stefani shared. “It’s probably because I’m super in love and have a really manly man [Shelton]. I enjoy letting that part of me come out now because when I was in No Doubt, I never thought of myself as sexy. Even in my 30s, I was a tomboy. I hardly ever carried a purse.”  Her affection for the “I Lived It” singer carried over to her answer to the question of “What’s your favorite thing that you’ve ever worn?”  “The red Yanina Couture dress I had on when Blake and I stepped out [together] for the first time,” Stefani explained. “That was a magical night, and I loved the flowers.”  Shelton’s inspiration influenced Stefani’s Las Vegas residency show, Gwen Stefani — Just a Girl, when she sported a cowgirl-inspired ensemble for “Make Me Like You.”  “That part of the show is my super love note, my, ‘I am so grateful, this is how much you influenced me and gave me life,’” she told Extra’s Mark Wright.  The couple continues to support one another through their separate endeavors, as Shelton flies back and forth to Vegas for Stefani’s show while filming season 14 of NBC’s The Voice.',\n",

He is currently in Las Vegas for his “Time of Our Lives” show at the AXIS at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino and talked about the ladies in his life, who is favourites are and gave a sneak peak at his pre-show ritual.  His response to why women are so powerful and why he is surrounded by so many beautiful and powerful women was, “Well, let me tell you, a woman made me a man. I was raised by women. Therefore I understand women, I love to be around women, and I understand the power of women. I think women are the most powerful thing on earth. They know how to deal with things that in no way, shape or form could men deal with. I mean, let’s just start with giving birth, let’s just say.” One of his favourite, powerful and beautiful women? “Someone that I love to be around, and she’s so fun and funny, great personality, drop-dead gorgeous, and she’s a hard worker, it’s Sofia Vergara. I’m very proud of her.” And he talked about another women that he has worked with a bunch and continues to, Jennifer Lopez. “Not only is Jennifer someone that I admire and look up to, but she’s also helped me tremendously in my career. The reason you guys don’t see us on stage like that is that she’s incredibly busy. Thank God she’s on one side running and gunning, and I’m on the other side, running and gunning. You know all I do is that I watch, I learn, I apply, and I keep it moving. But hopefully soon we’ll be on stage together, and every time we get on stage, some how, some kind of magic happens.”  Photo credit: Twitter via Pitbull',\n",
       " \"Don’t cross Drew Barrymore!  The 43-year-old Santa Clarita Diet star opened up on Thursday’s Jimmy Kimmel Live about getting revenge on an ex-boyfriend in her teens.  “I spray painted an ex-boyfriend’s car,” she revealed. “It was really fun. We blasted Cypress Hill. It was mid-‘90s, late-‘90s. We felt so baller.”  In order to maintain her innocence, Barrymore spray painted things her ex wouldn’t have expected onto his car.  “A lot of really horrible things that would not seem like me. It wasn’t like, ‘You screwed me over, you d**k.’ It was like, ‘Anarchy’ and ‘Black Flag,’” she noted. “And then he called me crying like a little b**ch, and he said, ‘You wouldn’t have done this, would you have?’ And I was like, ‘Noooo.’”  Barrymore added that she never admitted her act of rebellion to her ex, saying, “It was really gratifying and now he knows it’s me…I went with my girlfriend Justine, and we were young and we felt so cool driving up the Canyon in my Ford Bronco, blasting Cypress Hill. It was such a moment. It was worth the phone call I might get sometime soon.”  Barrymore also reflected on her one-of-a-kind childhood, and talked about meeting the late Princess Diana as a kid around the time E.T. came out.  “I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the most exciting moment for me to meet a real-life princess, the real life princess, the People’s Princess,” she recalled. “Diana was and is and will always be the epitome of a woman that all little girls look up to. She was so kind and so nice and I have to say growing up with her as a princess was just such a good example.”  In the photo of the encounter, director Steven Spielberg is carefully watching Barrymore as she meets with royalty.  “You can see Steven [Spielberg]’s really looking, wanting to make sure I didn’t mess this up,” Barrymore said of her godfather. “He was very paternal to me, and he was like, ‘Well, your mom took you to Studio 54 last night so I want to make sure you don’t mess up’… -- and thank you, Mom, because it was so fun – ‘I want to make sure you don’t screw up this very royal, regal moment.’”  Barrymore hopes to instill a similar sense of responsibility in her own children – daughters Frankie, 4, and Olive, 5.  “I really do want them to summer intern when they start asking for money and doing their own laundry and learning how to be self-preserving,” she said. “I don’t want them to have a hard knock life the way, you know, I certainly grew up in an unorthodox way, but there were also so many cool things to it too. It was a balance that took a real art to navigate, and they’re not going to have any kind of life like that. So I’m always trying to figure out what will be their harsh realities that will really motivate them to be empathic and know that it’s important to take care of yourself and ours.”  Kimmel then brought up that Barrymore had Madonna at her 12th birthday party, and the actress added that Billy Idol, Grace Jones, and Stephen Pearcy from the band Ratt were also there.  “It was so cool,” she admitted. “My kids are going to miss out on fun things like that.”  For more from Barrymore, watch the clip below:\\xad\\xad\\xad  RELATED CONTENT:  Sarah Paulson Talks Drew Barrymore Confronting Her About Her Impression  Karamo Brown Says Chrissy Teigen & Drew Barrymore Being 'Queer Eye' Fans Makes Him 'Weep' With Joy (Exclusive)  Drew Barrymore Talks Possibility of 'E.T.'

       " 'It has been 20 years since NSYNC formed in Orlando, Florida, bringing together Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and JC Chasez to form one of the biggest boy bands in the world. The group was launched first in Europe and essentially became an overnight success with their singles “I Want You Back” and “Tearin’ Up My Heart” before they were signed to RCA, transferring their success to North America. While their first album did well, their second album, No Strings Attached, did even better, becoming both the best-selling album of the decade and the top-selling album of 2000. It all came to a halt after a whirlwind of domination in the music industry when the group went on hiatus in 2002 and never re-formed. Everyone is well aware of the success and celebrity Justin Timberlake has enjoyed in his solo career, but in case you ever wondered how everyone in the group fared since their money-making heyday, check out NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?  5. Chris Kirkpatrick  Estimated Net Worth: $13 Million. Chris Kirkpatrick may unfortunately be one of the most easily forgotten NSYNC members, but he is still doing well for himself with a net worth of $13 million. Following his days with the band, Kirkpatrick worked as a voice over actor, most notably on The Fairly OddParents. He then surprised fans when he appeared on the show Gone Country 2, and although he didn’t win, he impressed many with country song writing and singing skills. Since then he has kept a low profile and in 2015 appeared in the cult classic Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!  ADVERTISEMENT  2  4. Joey Fatone  Estimated Net Worth: $14 Million. Joey Fatone did not release any solo music after his career with NSYNC ended and instead turned to acting briefly, appearing in My Big Fat Greek Wedding and The Cooler, as well as other small roles. He enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after appearing on Season 4 of Dancing With the Stars where he ended up placing second. He has now turned to reality TV hosting, including Family Feud, The Singing Bee, and ReWrapped. He still manages to keep his bank account solid with an estimated net worth of $14 million.  3  3. JC Chasez  Estimated Net Worth: $16 Million. Along with Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez was recognized as a lead singer of NSYNC and following the group’s split he went on to pursue a solo career. While his albums didn’t generate too much buzz, he did have success writing and producing tracks for other artists. He also went on to be a judge on America’s Best Dance Crew which made him a respectable paycheque. He has also dabbled in acting, appearing in shows like the Ghost Whisperer and Las Vegas, and while he is by no means considered an A-lister anymore, he is still doing well with a net worth of $16 million.  4  2. Lance Bass  Estimated Net Worth: $22 Million. Lance Bass also turned away from a career in music after leaving NSYNC, and instead turned to acting where he has done voice acting and starred in his own film along with Joey Fatone, On the Line. He also done some work in dancing and writing, and has stayed in the public eye as an advocator for LGBT rights after coming out as gay in 2006. After his December 2014 wedding was broadcasted by E! as the first same-sex wedding broadcast on a major TV network, the former singer is now the host of the reality TV show, Finding Prince Charming. He’s done quite well for himself. He’s currently worth a respectable $22!  5  1. Justin Timberlake  Estimated Net Worth: $230 Million. There is really no need to compare Justin Timberlake’s success to that of his other bandmates, as he still reigns as one of the most recognizable and loved celebrities in Hollywood. Not only has he had an incredible solo music career with four best-selling albums and nine Grammys, but he has also done well in acting, appearing in films like The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends With Benefits and Trouble With the Curve. Along with collaborations with other big artists, major appearances and smart investing, Timberlake now has a net worth of an incredible $230 million.',\n",
       " 'Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores  Photography by\\u200b Philip Cosores  Well, they did it: Radiohead performed “Creep” at Coachella. It wasn’t the first time it’s been heard on this field – the band introduced it deep in their 2004 Coachella debut and Prince incorporated it in his storied 2008 set in terrific extended-shred style. But tonight’s rendition – the main set closer of a 22-song set, which marked the band’s fourth Indio appearance following stellar dual weekends in 2012 – was epic. When Jonny Greenwood hit the palm mute before the distortion kicked in on the first chorus, it was louder than the sound of a shotgun cocking.  Good damn thing it sounded so tremendous – unleashing the rare live gem was the necessary cherry on top of a spectacular rally after undergoing unprecedented sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history.  The set began as magically as one might imagine, with bright white pistons of light swirling around the group during airy A Moon Shaped Pool kickoffs “Daydreaming” and the acoustic-led “Desert Island Disk”. But the revelry was halted when, about halfway through third song “Ful Stop”, there was an abrupt buzz and pop – like the sound of a guitar cable coming loose but much louder – followed by a brief outage. That was forgivable. These things happen, and the band took it in stride (“Fucking aliens again,” joked Thom Yorke). But two songs later, well into In Rainbows staple “15 Step”, the sound dropped out once again … and didn’t come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.  After a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly with the otherworldly prog-jazz of “The National Anthem”, and for a moment, as they launched into “Let Down”, it seemed like everything was gonna be OK. But for the first time ever (I can’t believe I’m typing this) that classic OK Computer fave fully lived up to its name – the sound kicked the bucket mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans I’ve ever heard at a festival rose up as the band again played through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.  “I’m having audio anxiety,” exclaimed one exasperated fan. “I have an actual fear of the music stopping again.”  For a moment, it appeared that what should’ve been one of the most landmark sets of the weekend might end up a complete disaster. True, anyone who was on the fence about seeing Radiohead probably bailed at this point – the audience visibly thinned out by the thousands during the downtime. But over the course of the next hour or so, with all sound issues resolved, Radiohead more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by “Creep”, which was followed by a standout encore of “You and Whose Army?” – replete with a larger-than-life close-up of Yorke’s eye, simultaneously the most wonderfully intimate and terribly uncomfortable sight – alongside the rollicking “Bodysnatchers” and galvanic sing-along “Karma Police”.  Sound problems like these are cringe-worthy for any fest headliner, but in this case, it worked to the performers’ advantage. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead – they’re not as invincible as some people make them out to be, but they still proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: fucking great rock music.  Setlist:  Daydreaming  Desert Island Disk  Ful Stop  Airbag  15 Step  The National Anthem  Let Down  Street Spirit (Fade Out)  Bloom  Identikit  Everything in Its Right Place  There There  Weird Fishes/Arpeggi  Burn the Witch  Idioteque  Nude  Creep  Encore:  You and Whose Army?

       " 'Vanessa Grimaldi is moving past her heartbreak.  Six months ago, fans of ABC’s The Bachelor watched Nick Viall and the Canada native fall in love and get engaged on last season’s finale. Five months later, the duo announced their split, saying in a statement, “We gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Now, the 29-year-old is opening up about why things didn’t work out and how she plans on moving forward.  “My relationship with Nick and experience on The Bachelor has given me so many amazing and memorable moments in my life, and I am forever grateful,” Grimaldi exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Nick and I were always transparent about the challenges in a relationship. We certainly had ours. I fell for him hard, and when you fall in love that hard, your heart breaks even harder.”  David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images  “In the end, as much as we loved each other and tried to make it work, we just realized we were different people fighting to keep a relationship when ultimately we just weren’t’ the best fit for each other,” she adds. “It wasn’t the distance that was ever an issue. Both Nick and I decided together, with our families’ support, that I would put my teaching career on hold and uproot my life to Los Angeles to support him on Dancing with the Stars and build a life together.”  MARLON KUHNREICH  Of the emotional Instagram she posted last week, Grimaldi tells PEOPLE, “I wanted to share that message with the world. Whatever hardships people are going through, don’t be embarrassed of feeling no feelings – if it’s anger, hurt, sadness – just remember at the end of the day to remain optimistic, because you will come out of it, and you’ll come out it a stronger person. It always will be okay in the end.”  Viall appeared on two previous seasons of The Bachelorette and season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise before taking his turn as the lead suitor.  Even before getting engaged, L.A.-based Viall and Canadian Grimaldi struggled to decide where they would continue their relationship.  Viall is handling the split “okay,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “It wasn’t an overnight decision, and they’re amicable.”  “There’s no one set way to get over heartbreak,” Grimaldi says now. “When going through any hardship, it’s okay to take the time to grieve the loss of what could have been. It’s okay to cry and curl up under your covers for as long as you need. I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve done all of those things, but with my family’s and close friend’s support – it’s all really helped the process for me.”  MARLON KUHNREICH  “I’m trying to look forward now and remain positive,” she adds. “It’s hard sometimes, breakups aren’t easy, letting go of the idea of what could’ve been isn’t easy, either, but I’m trying to stay optimistic about the future and that one day the person that I’m meant to be with and start a family with — when the timing is right — we will find our way to each other.”  In the end, Grimaldi came out of this a stronger person and wants nothing but the best for Viall.  “When you fall in love with someone with all that you have, it’s hard to let go. Every part of you gets shattered,” she says. “I’m trying to pick up the pieces. … I hope he finds his person and his happily ever after that we unfortunately couldn’t find together.”',\n",
       " \"From left: Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner. (Brian Bowen Smith/E!)  Love ’em or hate ’em, the Kardashians are a cultural force that built an empire out of an E! reality TV series. And as the family marked its 10th anniversary on TV, in perhaps a maddening publicity savvy move, gossip sites began running stories that the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner brood was pregnant.  Even as the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” special aired, a chyron scrolled by on the bottom of the screen reading: “KYLIE JENNER IS PREGNANT: REPORTS.”  That story line alone would have been enough to heighten the world’s attention on the family: Pregnancy is a hot commodity for celebrity news coverage; Kylie is just 20; and she’s only been linked to her current boyfriend for about six months. But the scrutiny amped up considerably as other pregnancy-related stories hit the tabloids.  [Why you still can’t stop watching ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ 10 years later]  None of the famous sisters has actually confirmed, on the record, that they are expecting. Still, the stories are breaking and it can be hard to get a handle on them all. Here’s a rundown:  Kim Kardashian surrogacy rumors (summer 2017)  This was the first peg in the pregnancy saga. TMZ ran a story in June that Kim and husband Kanye West had hired a surrogate to carry their third child, including some juicy details as to how much they were paying.  Then in July, Us Weekly ran a story that the surrogate was three months pregnant and expecting in November.  But, in an August Hollywood Reporter cover story, the outlet wrote that “on the possibility of a third child, reportedly via a surrogate,” Kim said: “I hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We’re definitely trying. We are hoping so.”  On Thursday, Kim tweeted the trailer for the upcoming season of her family’s reality show — in which she confirms that she’s having another baby. “What happens every time I say, ‘Guess what?’ ” Kim says to Khloé over FaceTime. “You’re pregnant — or the person’s pregnant,” her sister responds.  “We’re having a baby!” Kim says.  Season 14 is gonna be wild. Tune in this Sunday!!! #KUWTK pic.twitter.com/rnpIdGiNyK — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 28, 2017  That Kim may have hired a surrogate at all wasn’t surprising to begin with; she’s been public about her prior difficult pregnancies with North and Saint, and the life-threatening conditions she endured while carrying them.    Kim Kardashian and Kanye West arrive at the 2015 CFDA Fashion Awards. (Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)  Kylie Jenner, allegedly pregnant (starting Sept. 22)  TMZ dropped the bombshell Friday: The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner brood is pregnant, and the father is Travis Scott. The two have been romantically linked since April.  But Kylie herself has not confirmed the reports. Neither have her family members — sort of.  Hollywood Life cited an individual close to Caitlyn Jenner as saying she was “shocked and disappointed” to hear her 20-year-old daughter was pregnant. Then, in a non-denial denial, the British tabloid the Sun wrote: “Speaking about claims Caitlyn wasn’t personally told her youngest daughter is pregnant, the Olympian’s rep confirmed she was told and said: ‘All I can tell you is that it was some time ago.’”  What about Kris Jenner? During “Live With Kelly and Ryan,” Ryan Seacrest read a text from the momager herself. “Kris says Kylie’s not confirming anything,” Seacrest said on air. “That’s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.”  Kris also talked to the Cut at the Bottega Veneta fashion show, and the matriarch offered frustratingly few details:  Did you know the news was going to break about Kylie? I just woke up this morning. She’s not confirmed anything. I think it’s kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that’s just happening. So, you didn’t know that rumor was going to happen? Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment.  Even Kylie herself posted throwback, flat-tummy photos on social media — along with a more recent one offering an inconclusive peek at her stomach.  Then came the gossip about how the rest of the family was taking it.  “Kim Kardashian’s first reaction to Kylie’s pregnancy news was reportedly not great,” read a Harpers Bazaar headline. Kim tweeted it adding:  This sounds like a very fake story... https://t.co/ZIxCltgK6d — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 26, 2017  People cited an individual saying it was the family’s “nightmare” that Kylie would get pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Tyga. (And in case you need a catch-up: Tyga, who dated Kylie Jenner for years, shares a child with Blac Chyna, who then went on to have a daughter with Rob Kardashian. The Blac Chyna-Rob Kardashian romance was short-lived, filmed on a sad reality TV show; it led to a public meltdown and a restraining order.)  [Rob Kardashian, the most tragic figure of America’s most fame-seeking family]  Khloe Kardashian, also apparently expecting! (Sept. 26)  On Tuesday, TMZ, E! and BuzzFeed all cited anonymous individuals in reporting that the 33-year-old younger sister of Kourtney and Kim is pregnant, and her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson, is the father.  According to TMZ, Khloe is three months along. Let the clue hunting begin.  Khloe said she was drinking champagne during the family’s 10th anniversary special, which was pretaped. She also talked about Thompson: “Yeah, it’s a serious relationship.”  She also said she’s always in Cleveland whenever he is. Days before the anonymously cited reports about her pregnancy broke, she posted this bare-belly photo, prompting a lot of curious fans to wonder if she was actually three months along. (Yes, we’ve approached Zapruder film-level analysis here.)  The June season finale of KUWTK included a story line in which Khloe explored whether to serve as a surrogate for Kim. A fertility specialist delivered not-great news to Khloe, and suggested she stop taking birth control pills.  Khloe did just that, and when she received an update that her chances of conceiving had improved, she called Thompson.  “I am so relieved to know that I am able to get pregnant,” Khloe said on air. “Now I have so many other things to think about. Do I wanna have my own baby now? I don’t know. I’m at a crossroads.”  She continued: “Tristan and I definitely talk about starting a family. He wants to have about five or six kids with me and that’s lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I’m not on birth control is scary. It’s like a really big step.”  The conspiracy theories (from the beginning until forever)  The convergence of these three story lines has led to this:  “All the Evidence That Khloe Kardashian Is Kim’s Surrogate,” reads a Marie Claire headline.  “Is Pregnant Kylie Jenner Secretly Kim Kardashian’s Surrogate? An Investigation,” proclaims the Daily Beast.  What if the twist in the alleged Kylie Jenner pregnancy is that she's Kim and Kanye's surrogate for baby no. 3? pic.twitter.com/RI8CG18Qvz — David Onda (@David_Onda) September 22, 2017  Regardless of whether there’s any truth to these avalanche of rumors, one thing’s certain: People will keep watching the family on TV, keep scouring social media for clues and will keep keeping up.

       " 'Jennifer Aniston is ready for society to accept every body type — not just a “size 4.”  The actress, 49, talked about how excited she is for the Miss America pageant to eliminate the swimsuit competition this year, and the implications for body acceptance.  “I love that the Miss America pageant is going to get rid of the swimsuit competition altogether,” Aniston said in the September issue of InStyle. “You know, a swimsuit body is a body in a swimsuit, no matter what that body is.”  Aniston — who plays an ex-pageant queen in her upcoming movie, Dumplin’ — said that shaming people for their size is outdated.  “It’s time to just stop thinking beauty is in the shape of a size 4 and the right butt size and the right waist size and the right measurements,” she said. “It’s just old. We’ve done it. We’ve been there. Let’s move on.”  Jennifer Aniston More  And while Aniston is likely around a size 4 herself, she is still frequently body shamed — she had to explain in 2016 that she wasn’t pregnant, she just ate a burger, after photos of her in a bikini led to internet speculation. Aniston told InStyle that she dealt with body insecurities as a kid, too.  “I was one of the kids who the others would decide to make fun of. It was an odd period of time during fifth, sixth, seventh grades. I was a little on the chubby side, so I was just that kid,” she said. “Childhood is such a vulnerable time, and I’m sure a part of me believed all that they teased me about.”  RELATED VIDEO: Behind the Cover: Jennifer Aniston  Now, when her frustrations build up — whether it’s about body image or assumptions about her post-break up mental state — Aniston turns to boxing.  “Boxing is a great way to get aggression out. You get a mental release of all this crap you’re taking into your ears and eyes every day and have little fantasy moments imagining who you’re actually punching,” she said. “I’m just grateful it’s not actually the person, even though there’s one person. You know what I mean. It’s all good.”  Jennifer Aniston More  Aniston said that she discovered her “love” of boxing last year.  “It’s the longest workout I’ve actually stayed with consistently other than yoga,” she said. “There’s something about the mental aspect of boxing — the drills, your brain has to work, you’re not just sitting on a bike. It’s amazing.”',\n",

       " 'Fans of the original Roswell series have been waiting months to find out how The CW\\'s reboot, titled Roswell, New Mexico, compares to the teen-centered sci-fi series they first fell in love with nearly 20 years ago. On Saturday, the cast joined executive producer Carina MacKenzie (The Originals), at New York Comic Con to screen the series premiere months before the show debuts on The CW at midseason.  When the show begins, Jeanine Mason\\'s Liz Ortecho is a biomedical researcher who has returned to her hometown of Roswell, New Mexico, after 10 years away. She left following the death of her older sister Rosa, but returns home after the funding was cut for her research project. Upon her return, Liz comes face to face with her old friend Max Evans (Nathan Dean Parsons), now a police officer, who still has feelings for her and is not-so-obviously also an alien. We\\'re here to give you our (spoiler free!) first impressions.  Everything You Need to Know About The CW\\'s Roswell Reboot  Setting up pilots, especially pilots you want to establish as different from a beloved previous iteration, is difficult. Roswell, New Mexico is a little heavy-handed in its political commentary on immigration during its opening scene in which Liz delivers an impassioned lecture after being stopped at check point by Max before the pair recognize each other.  Once Liz and Max realize who one another are, the chemistry is instant. We\\'d go as far to say that the series doesn\\'t need as many flashbacks to their high school days to establish they have history. The palpable tension between Mason and Parsons is enough for anyone with a pulse to get the point, and there\\'s no hoodie big enough or baseball cap ratty enough to make Parsons pass for a teenager, so we\\'re hoping the series ditches the flashbacks as the show moves forward.  All in all, MacKenzie was able to balance nostalgic throwbacks to the original series and the book series Roswell, New Mexico is inspired by — the introduction Maria and Alex in particular drew big reactions from the crowd — while also making the series feel very 2018. The characters have been aged up so we won\\'t get distracted with things like cheerleading try-outs or SATs in the middle of big story arcs. The series also won\\'t have to juggle awkward college years come Season 3, something MacKenzie probably learned from her mentor and fellow executive producer Julie Plec.  Watch the Trailer for The CW\\'s Roswell, New Mexico  There are two major twists in the first episode that both bring surprising intrigue to the reboot. The first received raucous applause from the NYCC crowd and even had us going, \"I\\'ll take more of that, please.\" The second presents an interesting obstacle between our star-crossed (literally) lovers as we find out there\\'s more to Liz\\'s sister\\'s death than we know. That mystery will unfold throughout the season and by weaving our alien trio into it, MacKenzie has found a way to add a new element to the reboot that should also help establish a central mythology.  Roswell, New Mexico has a couple of pilot problems that befall the majority of new shows, but they are not unforgivable and can easily be corrected as the show finds its footing. Our advice is that the show trust what it\\'s established in the forefront and don\\'t rely on the past unless it reveals crucial plot information. The exception to this is, of course, the music (Edwin McCain\\'s \"I\\'ll Be\" is the first song heard playing at the Crashdown and is a delightful throwback for those of us that grew up the WB romances of the late \\'90s.)  Many people had justified reservations when Roswell, New Mexico was announced, but this show isn\\'t a mere knockoff of the WB series. And if it learns to trust itself, it could say something valuable in 2018. At the very least, there are very hot aliens making out with very hot humans and that\\'s very enjoyable to watch.

Me and Casey just tried to focus on what is happening with that character and what he’s trying to do and what is getting in his way. It sounds kind of simple cause you do that with every character.

Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she’s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.

Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.

Instead, somebody else will be providing the voiceover.  We will see \"other perspectives on Hannah\\'s story\", too. This is particularly interesting, because there were a couple of moments in the first season where certain characters questioned Hannah\\'s \"truth\".  Of note, remember the letter that Hannah gave to Zach? The one which she claimed he had thrown away, thus rejecting her plea for help?  The reality is that Zach actually kept the note. Did Hannah lie, or was she just mistaken? Maybe that will be explained.  Netflix  \"Hannah told her version of events, but there are at least 12 kids who have another version of those events that we actually haven\\'t really heard from yet,\" Yorkey said.  Time-wise, the second season will pick up \"a number of months\" after season one (according to Yorkey), and will in part cover the trial and the Bakers\\' lawsuit against the school.  Kate Walsh (Hannah\\'s mother Olivia Baker) teased: \"We\\'ll see more and more of the mystery getting revealed, and I think you see Mrs Baker still questing for the answers of what happened to her daughter.\"  You should also expect a number of other loose ends to be addressed when the show returns. Most of the characters were in a dark place by the end of last season (star Miles Heizer confirmed that the show will not shy away from \"taboo topics\" it tackled in the first season), but could some of them find happiness?  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  \"[The individual cliffhangers are] all related, so I would very much like to explore where they all go and to see if there is, as I think there will be, some light for these kids,\" Yorkey said.  Jessica is still trying to recover from her rape, while Bryce – who raped Jessica and Hannah – will hopefully be receiving some form of comeuppance, whatever that may be.  Netflix  \"I want to do Jessica\\'s story the deserved justice of following her as she goes back to school, as she tries to begin to recover from what happened to her, because it\\'s something that millions of young women go through,\" Yorkey said.  \"And also [I want to] see somebody punch Bryce in the face.\"  The cast seem to be in agreement as well, with stars such as Alisha Boe and Brandon Flynn saying that they hope to see \"justice for Hannah and Jessica\".  Timothy Granaderos similarly wants the people who wronged Hannah to be \"held accountable\".  Other cliffhangers from the season one finale include what happens with school counsellor Kevin Porter (will he be fired?), Alex\\'s suicide attempt, Zach desperately trying to reach Alex only to receive a call from somebody else, and Tyler\\'s stash of guns.  Netflix  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Selena Gomez, pop singer and one of the producers on the show, said that she has been in the writers\\' room and that there were story moments she learned which left her \"almost freaking out\".  She later said that the new season will be \"really encouraging and empowering\".  Any fears that 13 Reasons Why would have to censor itself in light of the controversy the show drew for season one (over its depiction of suicide) can rest easy: Dylan Minnette and executive producer Tom McCarthy have both said season two will not be censored.  \"I\\'m sure it\\'s going to be just as important and dark as last season,\" Minnette said.  The actor added that the second season\\'s theme will be \"recovery\", adding: \"It\\'s naturally going to progressively get to a more emotional place, due to the nature of the story we\\'re telling. I\\'m sure we\\'re all heading in some dark directions again.\"  And new cast member Anne Winters said that the new episodes will be less \"black and white\" compared to season one.  \"This season will explore a little of those grey areas... so that when people raise the question of, \\'Well, wasn\\'t it her fault that she did this or that?\\' this season shows a different take on it,\" she shared.  13 Reasons Why season 2 theories: Did Tyler shoot Alex?  With the way the season one finale ended, it\\'s not surprising that people have been coming up with fan theories about season two – many of which are truly clever and imaginative.  Perhaps the most popular one out there is tied to Alex\\'s cliffhanger. In the finale, Alex was fighting for his life after it was revealed that he shot himself.  We never saw this happen on screen, and fans have suggested that Tyler actually shot him instead. The theory points out that Tyler had a stash of guns hidden in his room, and that he ominously took down Alex\\'s photo that he had previously hung up in his studio.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Netflix  However, Miles Heizer (who plays Alex) has appeared to dismiss that theory.  \"That\\'s another subject that\\'s very rarely shown on screen and is probably a lot more common than people think it is: people attempting to take their lives and it not happening. I\\'m sure that will bring a crazy set of issues. It would be interesting to go into that,\" he said.  That\\'s not all. Alex was seen in an ambulance – but if you ask some fans, they think that scene is actually a flashforward and it\\'s not Alex there at all. Maybe it\\'s Bryce. Maybe it\\'s Justin.  As for Tyler\\'s stash of guns, one common theory is that he is planning a school shooting.  Netflix  Tyler had photos of numerous other students (including Clay) in his studio – people who have wronged and bullied him. Maybe these students are the targets, and maybe he actually took down Alex\\'s picture because he had decided to spare him (the opposite of the \\'Tyler shoots Alex\\' theory).  Lastly, a lot of fans seem to think that Tony is either a ghost or a figment of Clay\\'s imagination.  This one is a little more difficult to swallow (and indeed, Christian Navarro himself has shot that down), mainly because we have seen Tony interacting with plenty of other characters besides Clay, but it\\'s interesting nonetheless...

       " \"Kim Kardashian may have tried to save her family's relationship with Caitlyn Jenner before but she is now taking a step back, according to 'Hollywood Life.'  Kim Kardashian has always been the one from the Kardashians siblings who still tried to be a part of the life of their ex-stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner. However, it appears that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now taking a step back, especially when it comes to Khloe Kardashian’s feud with the former Olympian.  Khloe Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner used to have a really close relationship, especially when the former’s dad passed away and the latter took over as the reality star’s father figure. Unfortunately, their bond was ruined when the 68-year-old retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete transformed into a woman and started to talk badly about the Kardashian clan.  Since the 33-year-old TV personality will be welcoming her first child with Tristan Thompson soon, many wondered, including Ross King of the ITV show Lorraine, if this will mend her broken relationship with Caitlyn Jenner. When asked if the arrival of her baby will “affect things” with her former stepdad, Khloe Kardashian replied that things will remain as they were.  Although Khloe Kardashian didn’t exactly say that she will keep the child away from Caitlyn Jenner, a Hollywood Life source claimed that Kim Kardashian supported her sister’s decision to not make the I Am Cait star a part of her child’s life.  “Kim is standing behind her sister and she will always have her back,” the insider revealed. “Their family still feels slighted by Caitlyn about what she said about Kris in her book and they’ve really rallied around Kris.”  However, Gossip Cop noted that Kim Kardashian’s loyalty to her family is old news. Mrs. West has always fully supported Kris Jenner after Caitlyn Jenner said a lot of hurtful things about her mom in her books and interviews, and it has been like that for years. The site quickly slammed the new scoop and confirmed that there is absolutely no truth to the claim.  Gossip Cop reiterated that no one from the Kardashian/Jenner clan or anyone close to the family has talked to Hollywood Life regarding Khloe Kardashian’s decision to not reconcile with Caitlyn Jenner during her pregnancy.\",\n",
       " 'Oprah Winfrey Getty Images  President Donald Trump has long admired Oprah Winfrey, the much-beloved media mogul and self-made billionaire. But that may change now that Winfrey is reportedly considering a 2020 presidential bid herself.  Trump has spoken glowingly of Winfrey over the last few decades, even telling TV host Larry King in 1999 that Winfrey would be his top pick for a vice presidential running mate, should he run.  \"I love Oprah. Oprah would always be my first choice,\" Trump told King. \"She\\'s a terrific woman, she\\'s somebody that\\'s very special. If she\\'d do it, she\\'d be fantastic. She\\'s popular, she\\'s brilliant, she\\'s a wonderful woman.\"  And in 2015, Trump again suggested he might pick Winfrey as his presidential running mate, telling ABC News\\'s George Stephanopoulos that the two would \"win easily\" if they teamed up.  \"I like Oprah, what can I tell you?\" Trump said in the interview. \"She\\'s great, she\\'s talented, she\\'s a friend of mine, she\\'s a good person. I\\'ve been on her show. … I like Oprah, is that supposed to be a bad thing? I\\'d love to have Oprah, I think we\\'d win easily, actually.\"  Trump has also publicly praised her on Twitter, tweeting in 2012 that he \"adore[s]\" Winfrey and calling her \"terrific\" in a 2013 tweet.  The president has appeared on Winfrey\\'s long-running daytime talk show multiple times and 30 years ago, in 1988, discussed his possible presidential ambitions.  \"I know people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run — would you ever?\" Winfrey asked Trump.  Trump demurred, responding that he had no immediate plans to run for office, but went on to say that he would have \"a hell of a chance of winning\" because he, like many Americans, he argued, is frustrated by trade deals and foreign policy that he said disadvantaged the US.  \"I probably wouldn\\'t, but I do get tired with seeing what\\'s happening with this country and if it got so bad I\\'d never want to rule it out totally,\" he said.  Trump went on to say that if he were elected president, \"this country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for 25 years have taken advantage.\"  \"It wouldn\\'t be the way it\\'s been, believe me,\" he said.  Donald Trump and Winfrey. Screenshot/YouTube  Oprah 2020?  Speculation about Winfrey\\'s own political ambitions are mounting after she delivered a powerful speech at the Golden Globe awards on Sunday night, weaving stories of racial and gender injustice into a hopeful narrative that many argued read like a political stump speech.  \"I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,\" she said to a standing ovation.  While Winfrey recently shot down the idea of a possible presidential bid, telling Gayle King on \"CBS This Morning\" in October that there would be \"no running for office of any kind for me,\" she said on Sunday that she would consider a run. Two of Winfrey\\'s close friends told CNN that she is \"actively considering\" a 2020 bid. And Winfrey\\'s longtime partner, Stedman Graham, told The Los Angeles Times on Sunday that Winfrey would \"absolutely\" run if \"the people\" want her to.  In fact, Winfrey told Bloomberg last March that Trump\\'s election inspired her to consider the possibility.  \"I thought, \\'Oh gee, I don\\'t have the experience, I don\\'t know enough.\\' And now I\\'m thinking, \\'Oh. Oh!\\'\" she said.  Winfrey was a strong supporter of former President Barack Obama\\'s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and she endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. But her political positions are largely unknown.  During a 2008 stump speech for Obama in Iowa, Winfrey said she\\'s voted for candidates on both sides of the aisle.  \"Over the years, I\\'ve voted for as many Republicans as I have Democrats, so this isn\\'t about partisanship for me, this is very, very personal,\" she said. \"I\\'m here because of my personal conviction about Barack Obama and what I know he can do for America.\"  The White House responded to the 2020 speculation on Monday.  \"We welcome the challenge, whether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on Monday, adding that Trump will definitely run for reelection.

       " 'AMC\\'s zombie drama returned last Sunday with the season 9 premiere---an episode which marked an uptick in overall quality for The Walking Dead, but still made some old, avoidable foibles that almost look like bad habits at this point.  New showrunner Angela Kang has been a writer on the show since Season 2, and it appears that even with improved dialogue and cinematography, she\\'s been unable to shed some of the show\\'s most annoying proclivities. Old habits die hard, it seems. But, like Gregory and a few other characters, they really do need to die.  Let\\'s take a look at three big mistakes the show made in its Season 9 premiere, and how each could have been easily avoided with a little more quality control and a little bit more courage. With some very small changes, this could have been a much better episode.  Spoilers through Season 9 of \\'The Walking Dead\\' follow.  1. The museum scene.  Things got off to something of a bad start when our heroes went to D.C. I\\'m going to list this as a two-part problem. My first problem with this sequence is a creative disagreement with the show\\'s producers and writers. My second is pretty much just the objective truth.  First: An excursion to Washington D.C. to find seeds and other tools should have been a much more interesting, extended story. I think you could easily fit in an episode or two with a small group of scavengers going to D.C. and getting into various pickles there. That it was just one not very good scene at a museum really diminished something I was looking forward to, stripping of it of almost all its potential as an interesting little adventure (which the show has so few of these days.)  Second: The museum scene was just bad. There was very little explanation as to why they needed all these heavy objects---surely there were more modern versions of things like carts and ploughs which they could find on farms or in hardware stores.  Worse, the entire sequence with the glass floor was embarrassingly bad. The floor itself would not have cracked so easily. That kind of glass is made to withstand a great deal more impact. But even if they\\'d had it broken to begin with, making it more precarious from the get-go, there was no reason they couldn\\'t have found another way around it. Passing items over the railing would have worked. Ezekiel could have avoided walking the entire length of the breaking glass by simply turning to one side or the other once exiting the stairs.  This is a classic example of The Walking Dead\\'s writers treating its viewers with contempt. We aren\\'t that stupid. And neither are these characters. These hardened survivors of the apocalypse should know better---and would know better if they weren\\'t continually written into these same corners over and over and over again. This entire sequence was insulting to our intelligence and had no business being in a premiere cable TV show.  2. The death scene.  The second big problem of the night came shortly after the first. Our group, comprised largely of characters we know and then also one other guy named Ken, is bringing the museum loot back to Alexandria and Hilltop when a small mob of zombies shuffles up behind them.  This leads to much fear and commotion, despite this being a much smaller zombie mob than we\\'ve seen the same survivors deal with easily in the past.  One thing leads to another and they decide to all run away and, bafflingly, abandon the horses. In an apocalypse where cars are no longer an option, horses must be one of the most prized---and hard to come by---resources out there. But a few zombies can scare Rick and his band of hardened survivors away regardless.  Utterly unconvincing. So when Ken (I think that was his name) runs back to save the horses we know right away he\\'s going to die. For reasons the show cannot provide, a zombie manages to sneak up on him and nobody can get to him in time to save him. Maybe that looked okay on paper, but it didn\\'t work on TV and left us with that bad, unconvincing taste in our mouths.  The Fix:  Now, you can fix #1 and #2 in one fell swoop pretty easily (but it won\\'t fix #3.)  Simply have the glass in the museum already breaking when they get there. Have them do everything in their power to avoid standing on it (like actual people with a self-preservation motive would do) but have something go wrong. Maybe there\\'s one last item (like the cart) that they can\\'t get around the glass and they lose control and instead of Ezekiel falling through the glass, Ken falls through the glass and is torn apart by zombies in the most gruesome manner possible.  Now we can avoid the bad parts of the museum scene and cut the other scene entirely and we get a more shocking, gory death. Everybody wins!  There\\'s just one problem . . . .  3. Using a character we don\\'t know as a catalyst for an important event. Don\\'t do that.  Every single significant death in a show needs to have a reason or serve some higher purpose, even if it just to shock audiences.  Ken\\'s death in the Season 9 premiere served a purpose, but it didn\\'t connect with us emotionally. It was a catalyst for Gregory\\'s final, fatal betrayal of Maggie. It led him to make a very stupid power play, the straw that broke the Maggie\\'s back, as it were, when he got the blacksmith drunk and convinced him to kill Maggie.  The problem? There\\'s no payoff. No emotional weight. Because Ken was not an established character at all. He was introduced just to die. His parents were introduced just so that the father could become Gregory\\'s tool in his latest horrible scheme.  This is something we saw happen from time to time in Lost. Characters were suddenly introduced on the island (how did they get there?) only to be killed off later that episode. We, as viewers, never gave a damn because we had no connection to these strangers.  This is hardly the first time The Walking Dead has done this, of course. That scene where Simon stops Maggie\\'s caravan and kills that one guy---Dave was it?---who we only just met moments earlier. Another scene I think all the way back in Season 5 where a brand new character and love interest of Beth\\'s falls into a zombie-infested cellar. I\\'m pretty sure that happened but I don\\'t remember it well or care at all because we never care about brand new characters.  Okay, that\\'s not always true. A skilled filmmaker can make us care deeply about characters we just met. Think of the opening moments of A Quiet Place, or the puppy scene in John Wick. But that takes a bit of work. You have to establish an emotional connection in a very short period of time to a character (or dog) we just met. It can be done, but it takes more than a twenty second conversation on the road followed by a swift death and a bunch of melodramatic \"blame Maggie\" scenes. (Seriously you miserable pricks, I get that your son just died and that sucks and you should feel sad, but blaming Maggie for this is absurd. It\\'s the zombie apocalypse. People are dying all the time. Grow up.)  The Fix:  So how could you fix this problem and #1 and #2? Given that the blacksmith\\'s family was not introduced in prior seasons, the only way I can figure it out is to make the D.C. trip longer. Three or four episodes at least. Have Ken play a much larger role and get us to really like him. Introduce his parents early on, too. Let us get to know them at least a little before he is ripped to tiny giblets by the walking dead.  Establishing Ken as an important, likable character before offing him would definitely help, especially if it was a surprise. I add \"likable\" to the mix because, as we saw in season 4 of Fear The Walking Dead, introducing a character everyone hates and then making him the final \"big death\" of the season is also terrible writing.  So those are my big three problems with the Season 9 premiere. Without them, I think it would have been a really strong episode. With them, because they\\'re so easily avoidable and so in keeping with all The Walking Dead\\'s worst habits over the years, the episode was just okay. It had some very good moments, but those were sullied by these inexplicably bad ones.  So this is my message---my plea---my best advice to Angela Kang: Every episode needs to be checked over and checked again for this kind of mistake. Quality Control\\'s job needs to be finding every instance of a Walking Dead character making an out-of-character decision or acting stupid for no reason (other than to further the plot) and ensure that it\\'s rewritten to make sense. Sure, some people who watch this show are not particularly discerning, who think just because the premise is outlandish nothing needs to be plausible, but a great deal of the audience (the dwindling audience, I might add) wants this show to be a realistic take on the apocalypse. Make these actions add up. Earn your outcomes.  Fortunately, I think the next two episodes are less impacted by this all-too-familiar Walking Dead nonsense, though I can\\'t speak to the rest of the season. Let me know what you think of all this on Twitter or Facebook. Cheers!  Bonus: When Rick walks into the Sanctuary a bunch of people kind of turn in awe and one of the Saviors says \"That\\'s Rick Grimes. He ended the war!\" and it\\'s just such a classic Walking Dead moment where anyone with half a brain watching just slaps their forehead and shakes their head in pure wonder and amazement that anyone would write a line so on-the-nose and that, once filmed, it would ever manage to make the final cut.  Not only does nobody actually talk like that, it\\'s just totally superfluous. We know Rick ended the war. He also started it. We don\\'t need some weird recap from some random side character.

       " 'American serial child sexual abuser and physician  Lawrence Gerard Nassar (born August 16, 1963) is an American convicted serial child molester who was the USA Gymnastics national team doctor and an osteopathic physician at Michigan State University.  Nassar\\'s cumulative criminal acts of sexual assault were the basis of the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, in which he was accused of molesting at least 250 girls and young women and 1 young man including a number of well-known Olympic gymnasts, dating as far back as 1992.[1] He has admitted to ten of the accusations.  In July 2017, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges. On January 24, 2018, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in a Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to seven counts of sexual assault of minors.[2][3] On February 5, 2018, he was sentenced to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison after pleading guilty to an additional three counts of sexual assault.[4] His federal and state sentences are to run consecutively.[5][3]  Personal life  Nassar was born on August 16, 1963, in Farmington Hills, Michigan, to Fred Nassar (1925–2000)[6] and Mary Nassar.[7] In 1978, he began working as a student athletic trainer with the women\\'s gymnastics team at North Farmington High School. He had received the assignment on the recommendation of his older brother, Mike, who was an athletic trainer at the school. Nassar graduated from North Farmington High School in 1981.[8][9]  He went on to study kinesiology at the University of Michigan, where he earned his undergraduate degree in 1985.[9] During this time, he worked with the university\\'s football and track and field teams.[10]  He married Stephanie Lynn Anderson on October 19, 1996, at St. John\\'s Catholic Church in East Lansing.[8] The couple has two daughters and a son.[8] Stephanie Nassar was granted a divorce from her estranged husband in July 2017 and gained full custody of the three children.[11][12] At the time of his arrest by federal agents in December 2016, Nassar lived in Holt, Michigan.[8]  Despite the charges of sex crimes that had been made public against him, Nassar still decided to run for Holt School Board in 2016; he received 21% of the votes.[10]  Medical career  In 1986, Nassar began working as an athletic trainer for the USA Gymnastics national team.[10] In 1993, he graduated from the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. He went on to complete his residency training in family practice at St. Lawrence Hospital. In 1997, Nassar completed a fellowship in sports medicine[10] and began working as an assistant professor at MSU\\'s Department of Family and Community Medicine in the College of Medicine, earning $100,000 annually.[8] Nassar is listed as a co-author on at least six research papers on the treatment of injuries in gymnasts.[13]  Nassar began working as a team doctor at Holt High School in 1996.[10]  Gymnastics career  In 1988, Nassar began working with John Geddert at Twistars.[10]  From 1996 to 2014, Nassar was the national medical coordinator for USA Gymnastics.[10]  Sexual assault accusations and convictions  In 2015, USA Gymnastics cut ties with Nassar \"after learning of athlete concerns.\" In September 2016, The Indianapolis Star revealed that Rachael Denhollander and another former gymnast had accused Nassar of sex abuse.[14] Michigan State fired him on September 20; he had been reassigned from clinical and teaching duties a month earlier.[15]  In February 2017, three former gymnasts—Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard and Jamie Dantzscher—gave an interview with 60 Minutes in which they said that Nassar had sexually abused them. The gymnasts also alleged that the \"emotionally abusive environment\" at the national team training camps run by Béla and Márta Károlyi at the Karolyi Ranch near Huntsville, Texas gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse.[16] Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar,[17] said in court in May 2017 that Nassar sexually abused her on five doctor\\'s visits in 2000, when she was 15 years old.[18]  Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney, using the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, stated that Nassar repeatedly molested her, starting when she was 13 years old and until she retired from the sport in 2016.[19] Maroney subsequently filed a lawsuit against Nassar, Michigan State University, the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.[20]  The lawsuit accused USA Gymnastics of covering up the sexual abuse by paying Maroney $1.25 million to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Maroney\\'s attorney, John Manly, referred to Nassar as a \"pedophile doctor\".[21]  During a 60 Minutes interview, Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman also said that Nassar had sexually abused her.[22]  Raisman stated that Nassar molested her when she was 15 years old.[23] Gabby Douglas was criticized by fellow Olympic teammate Simone Biles and others for sending a tweet that they interpreted as criticizing Raisman and of \"victim-shaming\",[23] stating that \"dressing in a provocative/sexual way incites the wrong crowd.\"[24] Douglas later apologized for the tweet,[25] and said she was also a victim of Nassar\\'s abuse.[26]  Former national team member Maggie Nichols accused Nassar of abusing her. She documented the ways he \"groomed\" her by connecting with her on Facebook and complimenting her appearance on numerous occasions.[27] According to court filings and interviews, it was Nichols and her coach, Sarah Jantzi, who reported Nassar to USA Gymnastics officials on June 17, 2015, after the coach overheard Maggie and another gymnast talking about Nassar\\'s behavior.[28] Simone Biles came forward shortly after with accounts that she too had been sexually abused by Nassar,[29] and Jordyn Wieber made a statement at Nassar\\'s court sentencing in which she also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her during her time at USA Gymnastics.[30][31]  In November 2016, Nassar was indicted on state charges of sexual assault of a child from 1998 to 2005; the crimes allegedly began when the victim was six years old.[32] Ultimately, he was charged with 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors: fifteen in Ingham County and seven in neighboring Eaton County.  The allegations asserted that Nassar had molested seven girls under the guise that he was providing legitimate medical treatment at his home and at a clinic on the MSU campus.[33]  Nassar was arrested by the FBI in December 2016 after agents found more than 37,000 images of child pornography and a video of Nassar molesting underage girls.[34] On April 6, 2017, his medical license was revoked for three years.[35]  On July 11, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty to receiving child pornography in 2004, possession of pornographic images of children dating from 2004 to 2016, and tampering with evidence by destroying and concealing the images. On December 7, 2017, U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff sentenced Nassar to 60 years in federal prison.[5] If he survives that sentence, he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life.[5]  On November 22, 2017, Nassar pleaded guilty in Ingham County Circuit Court to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors under the age of sixteen. He admitted molesting seven girls, three of whom were under the age of thirteen. On November 29, he pleaded guilty to an additional three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County.[36] As of January 18, 2018, 135 women had accused Nassar of sexual assault while he worked for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University.[37] During the following week, the number rose to 150.[38] In a lawsuit that was filed in April 2017, a woman claimed that Nassar had sexually assaulted her while he was still in medical school in 1992.[1]  On January 24, Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina sentenced Nassar to 40 to 175 years in prison for the sexual assault of minors.[2] Aquillina allowed Nassar\\'s accusers to present extended victim impact statements and dismissed objections raised to this move by Nassar.[37] In sentencing, the judge informed Nassar that he had missed numerous chances to receive treatment for his sexual urges; Nassar had been aware of these urges from a young age. She added that there were likely dozens of additional victims who had not come forward. She made it clear that she did not intend for Nassar to ever be free again.[3]  Nassar was practicing without a Texas medical license while he worked at the Karolyi Ranch in Huntsville. According to gymnast McKayla Maroney, this is the place where Nassar molested young women for over 15 years. The practice of medicine without a license in Texas is a third-degree felony, although it is rarely prosecuted.[39]  On January 31, a Michigan judge stated that thus far 265 girls had accused him of sexual misconduct.[40]  On February 5, Eaton County Circuit Judge Janice Cunningham sentenced Nassar to 40 to 125 years in prison for the three counts of criminal sexual assault to which he had pleaded in November.[41] Nassar apologized for his years of abuse, saying that the impact his victims\\' statements had on him \"pales in comparison\" to the suffering he inflicted on them. Cunningham was unmoved, saying that she believed Nassar was still in \"denial\" about the \"devastating impact\" of his crimes.[4]  The Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the Ingham County sentence. In turn, Nassar\\'s state sentences will begin upon completion of his federal child pornography sentence; Neff had ordered that any sentences imposed at state level run consecutively with the federal sentence.[5][3][41] As a result, Nassar will serve a minimum of 100 years in prison; each individual sentence would have been enough by itself to all but assure that he will die in prison.[4]  Nassar, Federal Bureau of Prisons Register #21504-040, was transferred to United States Penitentiary in Tucson, Arizona in February 2018.[42] Earlier, he had been transferred from a Michigan county jail to the federal detention center at FCI Milan near Milan, Michigan.  In August 2018, The Detroit News reported Nassar had been transferred to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma pending assignment to a new prison. According to his lawyers, Nassar was assaulted almost as soon as he was placed in general population at USP Tucson. An investigation subsequently determined that Nassar could not be safely held at Tucson, and needed to be transferred to a facility where it was safe for him to be housed in the general population.[43] In August 2018, he was moved to the United States Penitentiary, Coleman.[44] His earliest possible release from federal custody will be March 23, 2069, by which time he would be 105 years old; if he is still alive at that point, he will then begin his state sentences.  Aftermath  Following Nassar\\'s conviction, more than 150 federal and state lawsuits have been filed against him, Michigan State University, the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, and the Twistars Gymnastics Club.[45] The entire 18-member board of USA Gymnastics (including Steve Penny) have tendered their resignations. MSU President Lou Anna Simon has resigned along with MSU Director of Athletics Mark Hollis. Additional people are also under scrutiny.[46] Nassar\\'s crimes at Michigan State and USA Gymnastics have drawn comparisons to Jerry Sandusky\\'s pedophilic activity at Penn State University.[47] In each case, mistakes were made when authorities \"turned the other way\" or tried to hide the activities of a child molester instead of immediately contacting law enforcement.[48][49]  Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette promised a full investigation into how Nassar was able to abuse young women for decades while working at the state\\'s university.[50]  Michigan State University has agreed to pay $500 million to 332 alleged victims of Nassar, settling lawsuits filed by the victims. It\\'s the largest amount of money in history settled by a university for a sexual abuse case.[51]  On July 18, 2018, more than 140 survivors of Nassar\\'s abuse appeared on stage together at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, California to receive the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage at the 2018 ESPY Awards ceremony. Gymnasts Sara Klein and Aly Raisman and softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez accepted on the survivors’ behalf and spoke. Klein identified herself as Nassar\\'s first victim 30 years prior.[52][53] Lead detective Andrea Munford of the Michigan State Police, former assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of the 30th circuit court in Ingham County, Michigan were identified. Aquilina was present at the ceremony. Singer MILCK performed her song \"Quiet”.[54] She was herself a victim of sexual abuse.[55]  In late July 2018, it was announced that Nassar would seek a new sentencing hearing due to concerns of perceived bias by Judge Aquilina.[56] His request was later denied by Judge Janice Cunningham.[57]',\n",

       " \"President Donald Trump has broken his silence on the James Comey hearing, declaring that the nearly three hours of Senate testimony from the former FBI director on Thursday amounted to “total and complete vindication” of his actions after winning the election in November.  Trump sent a tweet at 6:10 a.m. ET that also criticized Comey for his admission that he leaked information to the media via an intermediary in an effort to force the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion during the 2016 election cycle between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials. Comey’s gambit worked as another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, was named last month as a special counsel to the Justice Department to lead an independent probe.  There had been speculation that President Trump would offer his commentary on Comey’s testimony in real time on Twitter, but he waited until early Friday morning to weigh in.  “Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker!” the President wrote.  Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication…and WOW, Comey is a leaker! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017  Thursday’s hearing transfixed much of the nation as Comey answered questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee about his dealings with Trump and his assertion that Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russian officials. The Senate is investigating the broader question of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Trump and his associates have strongly denied there was any such collusion.  Related Parkland Survivors on Gun Control Google Pushes Back on Trump's Claim of Bias in Promotion of State of the Union  Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, repeatedly stated that Trump has lied in his accounts of their interactions. He blasted the President and members of his administration for what he described as a campaign to “defame” him and the FBI. Comey also asserted there was no doubt that the Russian government directed a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 election through hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s email system as well as through other cyber-malfeasance.  “There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever, the Russians interfered in our election,” Comey said.  The Comey has hearing generated a tidal wave of media coverage and analysis that will undoubtedly continue for many days. About 45 minutes after his tweet about the hearing, Trump sent another message praising Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” morning show, which is known to be among his favorite news programs.\",\n",
       " 'Back in 2002, the phrase “reality TV” meant programs like “Survivor” or MTV’s “The Real World” to the average viewer. Yet it was in that year that “American Idol” made its debut, transforming the face of American TV by achieving top ratings over the course of a decade and ushering in a new era of competition-based reality programs.  When “American Idol” first aired, few TV viewers in the U.S. had ever heard of Ryan Seacrest, Randy Jackson, or Simon Cowell, and it had been at least a decade since judge Paula Abdul was considered a hot pop star. But thanks to the unparalleled success of the show, they all became familiar faces to the American public, as did singers like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, who were destined for superstardom thanks to their performances live on TV.  All good things must come to an end, though, and starting this week on Tuesday, “American Idol” kicks off a three-day finale that not only concludes the 2016 season but brings the whole series to an end. Here’s a look back at some of characters who became famous—and famously cashed in—because of “American Idol.”',\n",
       " 'She has famously been engaged 19 times before. And on Wednesday’s The Real Housewives of New Jersey “Reunion Secrets Revealed” special, Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub made it to 20!  The 55-year-old reality star, who starred on the hit Bravo show’s first two seasons before returning this year, dropped the news that she and boyfriend Matt Caffrey are engaged to be married — news of which PEOPLE first reported in May.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  While a date wasn’t officially set, Staub revealed she had already started building her wedding party. “I’ve invited Teresa [Giudice] to be one of my maid of honors, along with my daughters [Christine, 23, and Jillian, 19]. And Margaret [Josephs], and Melissa [Gorga], and about 12 other people who are in my wedding party.”  Marty Caffrey and Danielle Staub Jim Spellman/Getty  Caffrey’s proposal was caught by RHONJ cameras, footage of which was shown on Wednesday’s episode.  “The engagement was simply beautiful. He is such a gentleman,” Staub said.  She wasn’t kidding. Caffrey had arranged for Staub (with the help of Giudice and Josephs) to tour the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where they stumbled upon an outdoor fountain. There, a violinist played Pachelbel’s “Canon in D” as a handful of couples danced around them.  Just then, Caffrey emerged from the crowd, taking Staub by surprise. “Oh my god,” Staub said upon seeing him. “Is this really happening?”  “Baby, when I first met you, I was struck with how beautiful you are. As I got to know you, I fell in love with you. I’ll do everything I can to love you, to protect you, and to keep you safe,” he said, taking a ring out of his pocket. “Danielle Staub, will you marry me?”  Staub’s response? “Absolutely. One hundred percent,” she said, kissing Caffrey and throwing her arms around him.  The ring was a sight to see too. Caffrey picked out a round cut diamond with four prongs and an eternity band — a perfect representation of their love.  “She deserves it. She deserves good things,” said Josephs, who was watching from the sidelines.  “She does,” Giudice added. “From knowing Danielle in the past, she hasn’t had the best experiences with men. It took awhile to find Marty, but sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. And I’m really, really happy for Danielle.”  Staub and Caffrey have been dating since April 2016. She celebrated their one-year anniversary on Instagram, sharing a selfie of the two and writing, “Here’s to my #first year #anniversary with this cutie … you are a wonderful man and I’m blessed to have you in my life … #happyoneyear.”  The couple haven’t shied away from sharing their relationship on social media, often posting photos together of their romantic date nights.  RELATED VIDEO: RHONJ‘s Danielle Staub Has Forgiven Teresa Guidice for Calling Her a ‘Prostitution Whore’ 8 Years Ago  This will be the third marriage for Staub. She and her last husband, businessman Thomas N. Staub, split after 14 years together before RHONJ began filming. They share Christine and Jillian together.  Staub’s past relationships were a huge subject of gossip among her fellow New Jersey Housewives on RHONJ — specifically her first marriage to former FBI informant Kevin Maher, who spoke openly about their past in his biography Cop Without a Badge.  That book (and the gossip surrounding it) was the catalyst for the show’s most iconic moment when Giudice flipped a table while arguing with Staub during the season 1 finale. The two have made up since and even bonded over a shared love of yoga as they rekindled their friendship.',\n",
       " 'No charges will be filed against Audrina Patridge\\'s estranged husband, Corey Bohan, after the former Hills star filed a domestic abuse case against him, ET has learned.  Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been harassing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s office which, after review, rejected the case.  “The prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney’s office told ET on Monday.  Patridge\\'s rep tells ET in a statement, \"Audrina is putting on a brave face, but these exchanges between Audrina and Corey are court ordered to take place at a police station for her protection. There is still a family law domestic violence case open.\"  Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge\\'s Restraining Order as She Requests He Be Forced Out of Their Home  Patridge and Bohan tied the knot last November after dating on and off since 2008, and share 1-year-old daughter, Kirra. Patridge filed for divorce on Wednesday, citing irreconcilable differences, and listed her and Bohan\\'s date of separation as Sept. 6. According to court documents obtained by ET, two days prior to filing for divorce, Patridge requested a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider for an alleged domestic violence incident. A judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge\\'s request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of Kirra, and their next hearing is set for Oct. 6.  \"Audrina’s No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time,\" Patridge\\'s rep told ET at the time.  On Saturday, the 32-year-old reality star broke her silence about the divorce drama, posting a video of Kirra on Instagram.  \"Light of my life. This little beauty lights up the room wherever she is!\" she wrote. \"I appreciate all your thoughts & messages, this is a difficult time but we are doing ok xoxo.\"  Audrina Patridge \\'Leaning on Support of Her Family\\' Following Divorce Filing  Watch the video below for more on Patridge and Bohan\\'s split.',\n",

The \\'Keeping Up With The Kardashians star hosted a bash at 1OAK nightclub at the Mirage hotel, after partying at Liquid Pool Lounge at the Aria resort, and he ensured he had a great night by getting close to some of the women who came to see him.  A source told E! News: \"Scott had at least 15 women crowded around at his booth. While smiling and laughing, he placed a hand on the shoulders of two of them, pulled them towards him and made out with both of them at the same time.\"  Meanwhile, it was recently reported that 34-year-old Scott\\'s former partner Kourtney Kardashian hopes their children Mason, seven, Penelope, four, and Reign, two, can help him to curb his partying lifestyle.  An insider said: \"She wants her kids to have a relationship with him.  \"She hopes that by allowing him to see the kids, it will motivate him.  \"The kids are the best possible influence on Scott. When he is on dad duty and takes them to the movies or out to lunch, he is at his best.\"  The 38-year-old reality star believes allowing the children to spend time with their father is the \"right thing to do\".  The source said: \"[Kourtney feels it is] the right thing to do is to help foster their relationship with him and not stand in the way. Regardless of how she feels about him and the decisions he has made, she does want her kids to have a healthy relationship with their dad.\"  It was recently claimed Kourtney isn\\'t the only person who is worried about Scott and his excessive partying.',\n",
       " 'Camila Cabello and her new man had a fantastic time on a beach in Mexico, and the two packed a lot of PDA as well! Things are actually going really great between the two, and one of the main reasons must be the fact that Camila’s boyfriend, Matthew Hussey is a dating coach!  Today, the couple was spotted hugging and kissing while in Mexico.  One eyewitness assured us that there was ‘Lots of PDA and smiles,’ while the two walked along the beach and enjoyed the sunset for more than 40 minutes!  So romantic! The dating coach must be excellent at his job!  Camila looked great in a black and white beach cover-up with yellow details.  She also accessorized with a straw hat that not only looked fashionable but also protected her face from the harsh sun.  As she and Matthew walked along the beach hand in hand, the star’s black bikini that she wore underneath her cover-up could be seen.  Meanwhile, Matthew rocked a tight T-shirt that showed off the man’s muscular build.  And his swim shorts were just as fitted!  In a picture, the two are shown standing on the rocks along the beach and kissing while in another Camila is seen leaning into her boyfriend, sweetly.  They are so adorable together, and Matthew really seems to be making the singer happy.  But are we even surprised he is so perfect for her (or for anyone for that matter)?  After all, he did write the bestselling book Get The Guy: Learn Secrets of the Male Mind to Find the Man You Want and the Love You Deserve.

       " 'Not all of Caitlyn Jenner‘s kids are dealing with her transition gracefully.  While the world has been on an inspiration high since Jenner’s AMAZING speech at the July 15 ESPYS, Kylie Jenner is reportedly not as thrilled. According to a source, Kylie has felt more “alone” than ever following Cait’s change.  [ Related: Surprise! Almost All Of The Kardashian & Jenner Kids Came Out To Support Caitlyn At The ESPYS! ]  A source explained:  “Kylie has not been taking this whole thing well at all and cannot come to terms with the fact that her father is now Caitlyn.”  Hmm. Considering the youngest Jenner didn’t show up to a recent Father’s Day event, we’re not surprised to learn she’s feeling this way.  The insider added:  “Caitlyn has been getting more attention than anyone in the family and perhaps that is part of what bothers Kylie. But also she feels incredibly alone lately and is barely coping. She used to be daddy’s girl but ever since her dad transitioned, Caitlyn does not seem to have the same time for Kylie that Bruce once did. It bothers her a lot and last night while everyone in the family was crying tears of joy, her tears were of sorrow.”  We can understand why the 17-year-old is feeling left out — the 65-year-old is more in demand than ever! Long gone are the days that the Olympian was chauffeuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner around Calabasas!  We just hope Kyles will eventually come around to Caitlyn…we know there’s a lot of love there. Hang in there, you guys!  [Image via E!.]',\n",

       " 'Bethany Minelle, News Reporter  Prince Harry - the world\\'s most eligible bachelor - and Hollywood starlet Meghan Markle are getting married.  Hundreds will attend. Millions will watch on television - including coverage on Sky News and Sky 1. The event will go down in history.  Sky News will broadcast live in Windsor the week before the wedding with all the build-up to the big day, with exclusive live coverage of the wedding in UHD in a special programme \\u202afrom 9am to 3pm\\u202c on Sky News and Sky One \\u202aon Saturday 19 May.  Image: Prince Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to the public in November  The couple say they want it to be \"a big shared event\" that is \"modern, inclusive but still adhering to tradition\", and they want \"everyone\" to be part of their big day.  So what can we expect from the Royal wedding?  When?  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get married on Saturday 19 May, at noon.  Guests will arrive between 9.30am and 11am, with members of the Royal family to turn up from 11.20am.  They will enter St George\\'s Chapel via the Galilee Porch, some on foot and others by car, while Ms Markle and her mother will begin their journey from the bride\\'s overnight location.  Image: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple  Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - who baptised Meghan in March - will officiate the service, which will take around an hour.  It will be televised from start to finish and will be followed by a carriage procession starting at 1pm and lasting for about half an hour.  1:32 Video: When Harry met Meghan  The main part of the parade will pass along The Long Walk - a two-and-a-half mile (4km) path that links Windsor Castle with Snow Hill in Windsor Great Park.  The inspiration for the procession is believed to have come from the wedding of Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex who got married at St George\\'s chapel in 1999.  Where?  The couple will tie the knot on the High Altar of St George\\'s Chapel, a 15th Century church on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Image: The pair sought the Queen\\'s permission to wed in George\\'s Chapel  One of the first things they will hear as a married couple will be a fanfare from 20 silver-plated trumpets.  After the service, Prince Harry and Meghan will leave the chapel through the west entrance and embark on a carriage parade through the town.  Image: They make their vows on the on the High Altar of St George’s Chapel  The steps of the chapel will be lined by members of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, and members of the Queen\\'s Guard Windsor Castle will line the streets within Windsor Castle.  Bank holiday  Members of the Royal Family normally get married in the week, but as Prince Harry and Meghan are getting married on a Saturday, there won\\'t be a bank holiday.  Image: The Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 was a bank holiday  Despite not getting a day off work, there is some good news for well-wishers - pubs will be open late over the wedding weekend.  The wedding falls on the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but with the cup final not expected to kick off until around 5.30pm, it is unlikely to clash with the royal big day.  Pubs, bars and other licensed premises will be allowed to keep serving until 1am, instead of the usual 11pm, on the nights of Friday 18 May and the following night, after the wedding.  Security  The wedding operation will be \"amongst the largest in Thames Valley Police\\'s history\", with up to 100,000 people expected on the streets.  Image: There was a heavy police presence for the wedding of Prince William and Kate  Measures will include barriers to prevent vehicle attacks, armed police patrols and airport-style security searches.  Police dogs, mounted police and the National Police Air Service will all be used in the run up to the wedding, and on the day itself visitors may be stopped and checked and British Transport Police will be patrolling train stations and carriages.  Thames Valley, British Transport Police, the Metropolitan Police and Surrey Police will all be involved in policing the event.  Wedding invites  The gilded invites, printed by Bernard and Westwood, were made using American ink on English card and feature the three-feathered badge of Prince Charles in gold ink.  Image: The invitations follow many years of Royal tradition and have been made by @BarnardWestwood. They feature the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink. Pic: Kensington Palace  Guests  Unlike the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, which was held in Westminster Cathedral with 3,000 guests, this will be a much more intimate event.  Approximately 600 guests have been invited to the ceremony.  Additionally, 2,640 people have been invited to celebrate inside the castle walls. They won\\'t be part of the congregation, but will all receive a sausage roll and a cup of tea.  Image: Palace aides have said the wedding will be a moment of \\'fun and joy\\'  The guest list will include 1,200 young people and others who have served their communities and shown strong leadership, 200 people from charities and organisations that the couple have a close association with, and 100 pupils from two local schools.  The couple have asked that people be chosen from a broad range of backgrounds and ages.  Windsor Castle community members and members of the Royal households and Crown Estate have also been invited.  One couple told Sky what it was like to receive the \"Hogwarts-style\" invite.  Who\\'s in?  This is a closely guarded secret, and Kensington Palace has issued no formal guestlist to the press or public.  Image: Queen Elizabeth II has given her formal approval to Harry and Meghan  As Prince Harry\\'s grandmother and head of state, the Queen will certainly be there.  All close members of the Royal Family will also be in attendance, along with close friends of the happy couple.  Some foreign royals, senior figures from UK establishments, the church and select politicians - both British and foreign - could also attend.  With Hollywood starlet Meghan Markle as the bride, a host of sparkling celebrities are also expected to attend (see Celebrities).  Who\\'s out?  :: The President of the United States  There has been much speculation over whether Donald Trump will attend the ceremony.  Image: US President Donald Trump said he hadn\\'t heard about an invite  A past critic of the American President, Meghan Markle formerly called him \"divisive\" and a \"misogynist\".  When asked at the beginning of the year by Piers Morgan whether he had received an invite Mr Trump said, \"not that I know of\".  In an uncharacteristically gracious tone Mr Trump went on: \"I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple.\"  :: Estranged members of Meghan\\'s family  An only child, Meghan has two half-siblings on her father Thomas Markle\\'s side.  2:06 Video: Royal wedding: Meet the Markles  Her extended family also includes a host of members from whom she appears to be estranged.  While her mother - Doria Ragland - and father are both expected to be at the ceremony, it is not known how many other members of Meghan\\'s extended family will be present (see Meghan\\'s family).  Image: Meghan\\'s half-sister Samantha Markle  Meghan\\'s half-sister, Samantha Markle, who is penning a tell-all book on the family entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\\'s sister, looks like she may have written herself out of an invite.  It remains to be seen how many of Meghan\\'s family make it to the ceremony, but one thing is for certain - Prince Harry\\'s family is set to outnumber the Markle clan to a massive degree.  :: The ex-husband  Meghan\\'s ex-husband, Hollywood film producer Trevor Engelson, is also unlikely to be there.  Image: Trevor Engelson was married to Meghan for two years  The couple divorced in 2013 after two years of marriage citing \"irreconcilable differences\".  New Royal baby  Prince William and Kate had their third child on 23 April 2018, just less than a month before the wedding.  Image: Kate will give birth to the Royal baby in April - the month before the wedding  The newborn prince has knocked his uncle - Prince Harry - off his spot as fifth in line to the throne, pushing him down the pecking order to number six.  Kensington Palace have said that Prince Louis, who will be just weeks old, will not be attending the wedding.  Celebrities  The fact that Meghan is an actress means there will be plenty of showbiz faces to spot during the day.  Image: Sarah Rafferty is one of Meghan\\'s closest friends on the set of Suits  For starters, a fair few of the Suits cast could be there including Meghan\\'s co-stars Patrick J Adams, Gabriel Macht and Sarah Rafferty.  Tennis star Serena Williams, singer-songwriter Elton John and former footballer David Beckham are all likely to be present.  Image: The Spice Girls are rumoured to have received an invite  Rumour has it that the Spice Girls - Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner, Emma Bunton, Mel B and Melanie Chisholm - may all have received invites to the wedding.  Additionally, Millie Mackintosh, of Made In Chelsea fame, may well be there, with the pair previously having spent time together at an Oxfordshire spa and Millie rumoured to have been invited to Meghan\\'s top secret hen do.  Meghan\\'s family  Meghan\\'s parents, who divorced when she was six, are expected to be at the wedding.  Meghan\\'s mum, Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga teacher and social worker who lives in California.  Image: Meghan with her mother Doria Ragland  Meghan\\'s dad, Thomas Markle, 73, a retired TV lighting director now lives in a seaside town in Mexico.  It is possible that Meghan\\'s half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr, could also be part of the congregation.  It is less likely that her half-sister Samantha Markle will be there (see Who\\'s out).  Image: Meghan with her father Thomas Markle  However, Ashleigh - Samantha\\'s daughter - who is estranged from her mother and said to be on good terms with Meghan, could be on the guest list.  Meghan\\'s uncle on her mother\\'s side, graphic designer Joffrey Ragland, 34, may well be in attendance.  It is unlikely that Meghan\\'s pet beagle Guy, who moved from Toronto to London with her, will be coming along to help the couple celebrate, although he could rock up at the evening reception.  1:55 Video: Meghan: Campaigner and Trump critic  The flowers  The Royal wedding flowers will be designed by self-taught luxury floral designer Philippa Craddock.  Image: Florist Philippa Craddock will create the floral displays for the wedding  Arrangements will feature white garden roses - one of Princess Diana\\'s favourite flowers - and peonies - believed to be a favourite of Meghan\\'s.  Branches of beech, birch and hornbeam will also feature in the floral displays, which will reflect \"wild and natural landscapes\".  After the wedding the blooms will be given to different charities.  Dress code  The dress code for guests attending the ceremony is uniform, morning coat or lounge suit, or a day dress with a hat.  Best man  Officially there is no such thing as a best man at a Royal wedding, which instead uses the term \"supporters\".  Image: Will Prince William \\'support\\' his little brother?  However, William was asked to be best man, as Harry was his for his big brother\\'s wedding in 2011.  However, Harry did not exactly rush to ask his big brother to help him out on his big day...  2:02 Video: Prince Harry has not asked William to be his best man... yet  When asked about the possibility of being best man or supporter in January, William responded: \"He hasn\\'t asked me yet… So, it could be a sensitive issue.\"  The Bridesmaids  Some of Meghan Markle\\'s celebrity best friends are being touted as possible bridesmaids - among them tennis ace Serena Williams, actress and UNICEF ambassador Priyanka Chopra and British reality TV star Millie Mackintosh.  Image: Maid of honour Pippa Middleton leads the flower girls and page boys down the aisle  But while one of her pals may be chosen as maid of honour, none of them are likely to make the cut as Meghan\\'s bridesmaid.  This is because unless Prince Harry and Meghan break with tradition, the precedent is to have children as attendants.  The flower girls are likely to be chosen from the children of the Royal Family - Princess Charlotte, who will be three by the time of the wedding, the children of Prince Harry\\'s cousins Mia Tindall, three, Isla Phillips, five, and Savanna Phillips, seven, are among the most likely to be picked.  Image: William and Kate with their bridesmaids and pageboys on the day of their wedding  Children of some of Meghan\\'s closest pals - including the daughter of stylist Jessica Mulroney Ivy Mulroney, four, and brand curator Benita Litt\\'s two little daughters who Meghan has called her \"fairy god-daughters\" - may also be contenders.  In the offing to be page boys are third in line to the throne Prince George, four, and Jessica Mulroney\\'s twin boys Brian and John, both seven.  Image: Flower girl Grace van Cutsem is not a fan of Royal weddings  While it is likely that Grace van Cutsem - the frowning flower girl at Prince William and Kate\\'s wedding - will be at the wedding, she is unlikely to be a flower girl this time, despite her scene-stealing performance on the Buckingham Palace balcony during Will and Kate\\'s first kiss.  Something borrowed  There are rumours that Meghan may wear the same tiara Princess Diana wore on her wedding day to Prince Charles.  Image: Princess Diana wearing the Spencer tiara in Australia in 1983  Known as the Spencer Tiara, it has not been worn in public since Diana\\'s death.  Meghan\\'s engagement ring is also made out of diamonds made from a bracelet which belonged to Princess Diana (see The Ring).  The dress  This is top secret, with much speculation over whether Meghan will go traditional, or step out in something with a more modern twist.  Image: Meghan in white at Westminster Abbey in March  Her stylist bestie Jessica Mulroney is said to have assisted her in picking a designer.  Designers in the frame include Erdem, Ralph & Russo, Roland Mouret, Inbal Dror and Jenny Packham.  Alexander McQueen - who designed Kate Middleton\\'s lace wedding dress - is also a frontrunner.  Another stylist friend, Misha Nonoo, is also rumoured to be creating something bespoke for Meghan to wear at the evening reception.  1:34 Video: The Pledge: Can Meghan survive \\'The Firm\\'?  Talking about her character in Suits, ahead of her engagement to Prince Harry, Meghan told Glamour magazine: \"I personally prefer wedding dresses that are whimsical or subtly romantic.\"  Meghan also said that she loved a \"low, ballerina inspired neckline\".  Her first wedding dress - for her marriage to Trevor Engelson in 2011 - was a white, floor-length strapless gown with a sparkling embellished belt to add a touch of colour.  As a former soldier, Prince Harry - who is now Captain General of Royal Marines - may be in uniform for the ceremony.  Down the aisle  Meghan\\'s father, Thomas Markle, was due to walk his daughter down the aisle.  There was much initial speculation over whether the 73-year-old - who is said to value his privacy and keeps out of the limelight - would carry out the duty on the big day.  Image: Will Thomas Markle walk his daughter down the aisle?  Although Kensington Palace confirmed his attendance, his poor health has meant he has had to drop out, so he can recover from heart surgery.  Instead, Ms Markle will walk through the Nave of the chapel with her pageboys and bridesmaids and then be joined by Prince Charles at the Quire.  Meghan\\'s mother, Doria Ragland, 61, will also be at the wedding, and will travel with her daughter by car to Windsor Castle.  Diana tribute  Prince Harry is keen to involve Princess Diana\\'s family in the wedding.  Image: Princess Diana will be remembered during the ceremony  All three of his mother\\'s siblings - Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer - will be attending.  Lady Fellowes will give a reading during the ceremony in celebration of her life.  The music  The couple have chosen musicians including a Christian gospel choir, a teenage cellist and a Welsh soprano to sing at the ceremony.  Image: Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir will be performing at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle  Kensington Palace said: \"Both Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken a great interest and care in choosing the music for their service, which will include a number of well-known hymns and choral works.\"  Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the BBC Young Musician of 2016, said he was \"bowled over\" when Meghan called him personally to ask him to play in the chapel during the wedding.  The rings  Meghan\\'s wedding ring will most likely be Welsh gold - a tradition the Royal Family have held since 1923.  Image: Meghan Markle shows off her engagement ring  It is not known whether Harry will choose to wear a ring or not - his brother Prince William shunned a ring, while his father Prince Charles wears a gold band.  Meghan\\'s all-diamond, yellow gold engagement ring was designed by Prince Harry.  The large central diamond was sourced from Botswana - a country the couple have twice visited together - and the two smaller side stones have been taken from a £100,000 ($140,000) diamond bracelet that belonged to Princess Diana.  0:34 Video: Diana would be \\'over the moon, so excited\\'  Prince Harry said the inclusion of his mother\\'s stones was \"to make sure that she\\'s with us on this crazy journey together\".  The engagement ring is estimated to be worth upwards of £35,000 ($50,000).  Royal kiss  The eagerly awaited first public kiss from the married couple will take place after the ceremony but before the carriage parade.  Image: Charles and Diana kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace  One of the defining moments of the wedding, it is likely to take place on the west steps of St George\\'s Chapel.  Prince William and Kate had their first kiss, following their wedding in Westminster Abbey, on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, mirroring the kiss of Prince Charles and Diana after their wedding in St Paul\\'s Cathedral.  The Photographer  The official Royal photographer on Prince Harry and Meghan\\'s big day will be Alexi Lubomirski - the same man who took their engagement photos.  Image: Alexi Lubomirski will be capturing the official Royal wedding images for Prince Harry and Meghan  No stranger to royalty -\"His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski\" to use his full title - is himself of royal lineage, having descended from an influential Polish family who received their hereditary title in the 17th century.  Lubomirski, 42, who has snapped the likes of Beyonce, Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Kidman, has said he is thrilled to be witnessing \"the next chapter in this wonderful love story\".  The reception  The wedding will be followed by not one, but two receptions.  Image: The interior of St George\\'s Hall where the first reception will be held  The first, which is being hosted by the Queen, will be a lunch for the 600 people who attended the wedding ceremony and will be held at St George\\'s Great Hall.  Later that evening, the second reception, hosted by Prince Charles, will be held in the grounds of Frogmore House.

It will be made by American pastry chef Claire Ptak, who runs Violet Cakes in Hackney - an organic hipster bakery in east London.  The price of the cake is unknown, with the bakery website stating that \"wedding cakes are priced on request\".  The gifts  Prince Harry and Meghan have asked guests and well-wishers not to get them wedding gifts, but instead to donate money to charity.  Image: Wedding gifts are being eschewed in place of donations to charity  The seven charities they have chosen reflect their joint passions including sport for social change, women\\'s empowerment, conservation, the environment, homelessness, HIV and the Armed Forces.  The organisations selected are CHIVA (Children\\'s HIV Association), Crisis, the Myna Mahila Foundation, Scotty\\'s Little Soldiers - a charity for bereaved Armed Forces children, StreetGames, Surfers Against Sewage, and The Wilderness Foundation UK.  Information on how to make donations is on the Royal Family website, with links to each of the charity\\'s websites to make it as easy as possible to give money.  The honeymoon  No location has been confirmed, but if tradition is anything to go by, these three locations are in with a good chance:  :: Botswana, Africa  Just a few weeks into their relationship Prince Harry and Meghan \"camped out with each other under the stars\" here.  Image: Prince Harry and Prince William visit Botswana in 2015  The couple returned for Meghan\\'s 36th birthday later that year.  Prince Harry, who visited Botswana with Prince William and Prince Charles shortly after Diana\\'s death, has called the South African country his \"second home\".  :: Seychelles  Image: Prince William and Kate honeymooned in the Seychelles  Prince William and Kate spent their honeymoon here, enjoying 10 days of sun, sand and local wildlife.  Kate and Wills rented the secluded private North Island to avoid the frenzied media speculation around their vacation.  :: Broadlands, Hampshire  Image: Broadlands, Hampshire, is a Royal honeymoon favourite  This 18th century English country house is a favourite honeymoon destination for the royals, enjoyed by the Queen and Prince Philip after their wedding in 1947, and Prince Charles in 1981 after his wedding to Diana.  Prince Charles returned in 2005 with his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.  The couple will not go immediately go on their honeymoon, which Meghan is said to be paying for as a gift to Harry.  Royal titles  Despite marrying Prince Harry, Meghan will not become Princess Meghan. For that title she would have had to be born into the Royal family.  If Prince Harry retains his current rank as His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, Meghan will become HRH Princess Henry of Wales.  21:07 Video: Harry and Meghan\\'s relationship - in their words  However, if Prince Harry is promoted to the vacant role of Duke of Sussex - as it is widely expected he will be - Meghan will become HRH Duchess of Sussex.  Other available titles are the Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Buckingham.  Royal coin  The Royal Mint have designed a commemorative coin to celebrate Prince Harry and Meghan\\'s marriage.  Image: Various versions of the coin are available  The coin shows the couple \"looking lovingly into each other\\'s eyes\" in a \"relaxed and informal\" setting.  An uncirculated version of the coin is priced at £13, a silver proof coin is on sale for £82.50, and the gold proof version will set you back £1,980.  Memorabilia  The Royal Collection Trust has released an official Prince Harry and Meghan china collection which will be sold at the Queen\\'s Gallery shop at Buckingham Palace.  Image: The choice of Royal wedding memorabilia is mind boggling  The blue and white china Royal wedding commemorative range which includes tea cups, coffee mugs, tankards, pillboxes and plates all decorated with the couple\\'s initials painted in 22 carat gold.  Ceramics designer Emma Bridgwater has also created two bone china half-pint mugs at her Stoke-on-Trent factory to celebrate the wedding, one with the Royal crest and the other with the words \"Game changers, Free Spirits, Big hearts and Well Suited\".  Unofficial commemorative merchandise - of varying degrees of quality - are being sold across the world include tea-towels, dress-the-paper doll book and car bumper stickers.  What next?  Prince Harry previously told Sky News he was keen to settle down and start a family but said \"there\\'s a process that one has to go through\".  0:28 Video: Prince Harry talks about settling down in 2015  Now that \"process\" has begun, bookies have begun taking bets on when Meghan and Harry will become proud parents, with the odds of a 2019 or 2020 Royal baby looking good.  When visiting Northern Ireland together in March, the pair met a husband and wife team who make baby products such as hypoallergenic Moses baskets and non-slip baths. Meghan joked \"I\\'m sure at some point we\\'ll need the whole lot.\"  Image: Prince Harry and his fiancée Meghan Markle meeting well-wishers as they leave Brixton  Watch this space…',\n",

       " 'There is a snowman’s chance in hell that Disney will give Elsa a girlfriend in Frozen 2.  And yet, thanks to a vague new comment from Frozen 2 co-director Jennifer Lee, LGBT Disney fans are probably going to get their hopes up once again, only to watch them melt.  “I love everything that people are saying [and] people are thinking about with our film—that it’s creating dialogue, that Elsa is this wonderful character that speaks to so many people,” Lee told HuffPost in a recent interview, when asked about the prospect of Elsa getting a girlfriend. “It means the world to us that we’re part of these conversations.”  Lee followed up that response with a lengthy comment that barely amounts to a “maybe” when read carefully: “Where we’re going with it, we have tons of conversations about it, and we’re really conscientious about these things. For me…Elsa’s every day telling me where she needs to go, and she’ll continue to tell us. I always write from character-out, and where Elsa is and what Elsa’s doing in her life, she’s telling me every day. We’ll see where we go.”  HuffPost correctly labeled that noncommittal response a “glimmer of hope” for the #GiveElsaAGirlfriend campaign, which sprouted up on social media in 2016. Others have been more generous in their assessment: “Ring The Alarm!” BuzzFeed declared. “Elsa Might Have A Girlfriend In The ‘Frozen’ Sequel.” But it’s safe to say that we can un-ring that bell. If you think there’s a serious chance Elsa will find same-sex love in Arendelle, it’s probably best to let that hope go. Disney has been down this road before.  “ For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. ”  Remember when eagle-eyed fans spotted a lesbian-looking couple in the Finding Dory trailer, creating mounting speculation that we’d see definitively LGBT representation in a Pixar movie, only for the film’s co-director to give the cop-out answer, “They can be whatever you want them to be?”  Or when the director of the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake promised an “exclusively gay moment,” angering social conservatives, only for Gaston’s sidekick LeFou to be briefly spotted dancing with another man in the film’s finale? (As my Daily Beast colleague Kevin Fallon wrote, “Truth be told, the most exclusively gay moment in this new Beauty and the Beast is my dramatic eye roll after seeing the actual thing.”)  Disney’s biggest PG-13 property has disappointed LGBT fans as well.  In 2016, director J.J. Abrams told The Daily Beast that he “would love it” if there were a gay character in Star Wars and that “it seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn’t be a homosexual character in that world.” Yet there are still no confirmed gay people to be found in the new films—despite some fans’ rigorous shipping of Finn and Poe. (And now that yet another Star Wars trilogy has been announced, there will be three more opportunities to depict a galaxy far, far away where, apparently, gay people either do not exist or live in hiding.)  For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. There’s no reason to expect them to stop toeing that line until it’s safe for the film giant to throw their full weight behind the LGBT community.  As the LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD noted in 2017, Walt Disney Studios “has the weakest historical record when it comes to LGBTQ-inclusive films” out of all the big studios. Disney’s got a family-friendly reputation to protect, and at a time when many Americans still think that children need to be protected from LGBT “corruption”—37 percent of respondents to one recent GLAAD survey, for example, said they would be uncomfortable with their child learning about LGBT history in school—a lesbian or bisexual Snow Queen is probably perceived as an unnecessary financial risk.  According to Fast Company writer Joe Berkowitz, the “most family-friendly studio on the planet would be inviting a boycott” if they gave Elsa a girlfriend—so why sell fewer tickets to a guaranteed smash hit when you can sell more?  And when Disney already caused an uproar among anti-LGBT evangelicals five years ago with Elsa’s nonspecific, feel-good song lyrics about “let[ting] it go” and “break[ing] through,” why would they double down this time around when they are sure to be under scrutiny?  The parallel isn’t perfect, of course, but I always think about the interracial couple in The Princess and the Frog whenever LGBT fans seem to think the moment for a queer Disney character has finally arrived. According to Gallup polling data, a majority of Americans have approved of marriage between black people and white people since 1997, and over 75 percent have approved since 2004, but Disney still waited until 2009, when support was over 80 percent, to tell the story of Tiana and her prince. That’s the definition of playing it safe.  So, if we speculate that Disney would wait to include an LGBT main character in an animated film until they only risked angering fewer than 20 percent of American viewers, then we’ve still got a ways to go yet. As of 2017, according to Gallup, only 64 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 42 percent in 2004. If approval continues to climb at that exact same rate, it will hit the 80 percent mark in…17 years—probably about the same time that Frozen 7: Olaf’s Revenge comes out.  It would be nice if Disney, like Elsa, could proclaim, “Let the storm rage on” and march forward. But if history is any indication, Frozen 2 will almost certainly give hopeful LGBT fans the cold shoulder.',\n",
       " \"It’s rare to find me without my curls smoothed, twisted by a curling iron into beach waves , and misted with texture spray. I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I’ve perfected my own blowout skills.  It may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business.  1. You don’t have a great blow-dryer.  Let’s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you’re blow-drying your hair often.  “If you have thick hair, you’re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,” Kérastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. “The technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,” she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be.  Yepez’s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you’ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon—and they’ll last you years.  2. You’re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel.  “After getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,” says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad’s creative director. “A cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,” he explains.  If you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo.  The best thing for your hair’s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. “Hair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,” explains Vaccaro.  Make sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That’s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it’s still a little damp.  If you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it’s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying.  3. You start in with the brush too soon.  On the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It’s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. “If hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,” he says. “This can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.” Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush.  4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head.  Using the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you’re applying it correctly.  “When some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,” says Yepez. “Sometimes you just forget the back of your hair.”  She advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she’s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers.  5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment.  You know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don’t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling.  “A nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!” Vaccaro adds. “The nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.”  Even if you’re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle—no matter how lazy you feel. “If you're just a ‘rough dry and go’ girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,” Lopez says. “It helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.” That means fewer haircuts, ladies.  Not all nozzles are created equal. “Look for thinner nozzles—that way, it’s more direct,” says Yepez. The thinner nozzle will help blast hot air directly to the roots and get more volume in your styles.  6. You’re using the wrong brush.  When it comes to choosing a brush, the type you use should depend on the results you’re looking for and your hair type. Typically a round brush is the stylist favorite for a voluminous, bouncy look. But you have choices when it comes to the material of the bristles. “For women with straight hair who want movement, ceramics are fantastic,” says Vaccaro. “For women who want smoothness but have coarse, frizzy hair, boar bristle is key to provide the right amount of tension needed to achieve that smoothness.”  Yepez adds that she favors brushes with ceramic-coated barrels (such as this T3 one ) since it heats up to dry hair faster. “If you have curly hair or need extra shine, it will get your hair to blow-dry quicker,” she says. For volume and lift in the roots, she recommends the YS Park G Series Curl Shine Styler Round Brush ($80). “This brush is the perfect size for any hair type,” she says. “The bristles are specially made to help with faster drying and less heat damage .”  7. You start drying from the back of the head.  According to both Lopez and Vaccaro, many women make the mistake of starting their blowout from the back of the hair. It’s better to start at the temples, hairline, and crown then move backwards to the nape. That way you tackle the most visible parts first.  “Usually you start in the back, and by the time you get to the top and hairline, your hair has dried making it harder to get smooth,”says Lopez.  And if you have bangs, we’re definitely talking to you. “The front of hair tends to be the most challenging to smooth—think cowlicks and short wisps—and is also the most visible part of your style,” notes Vaccaro. “By starting from the back, your hairline is bound to get frizzy, so get the tough part done first.”  8. You want volume, but don’t give your roots extra attention.  Lifting from the roots is key if you want more volume. “If you don’t have a lot of time or you’re not a professional and you want volume, a great tip is to flip the hair upside down and brush it so that your roots are going the opposite direction,” says Yepez. Do this while adding a final blast of heat with the blow-dryer. You can also use a wide-tooth comb or your hands.  If you want extra volume at the crown, you can set the top of the head with larger rollers. Put in the rollers while the hair is still warm from the blow-dryer. “Pin it up with a bobby pin, and let it cool,” she explains. “So you get the most full volume and a nice wave.”\",\n",
       " \"Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as “Hill Street Blues” and “NYPD Blue” helped define the modern TV drama, has died. He was 74.  Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.  Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV’s most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.  The recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.  On “NYPD Blue,” he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger — who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. — drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.  Related 'NYPD Blue' Follow-Up Series Lands Pilot Production Commitment at ABC 'NYPD Blue' at 25: Dennis Franz, Amy Brenneman, Gordon Clapp Reflect on Legacy  Bochco launched such series as “Hill Street Blues” — a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show — and “L.A. Law” for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (“NYPD Blue,” “Doogie Howser, M.D.”) and notable failures, including the musical police drama “Cop Rock” and the serialized courtroom drama “Murder One,” which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title “Murder in the First,” for TNT, where it ran for three years.  Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like “Cop Rock” given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, “With my deal, how could I not?”  Bochco wasn’t above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of “NYPD Blue” led to the actor’s exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former “L.A. Law” co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.  Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of “Hill Street” was born more out of necessity than design.  “We had so many characters that we realized we couldn’t service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,” he told the New York Times.  The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When “Cop Rock” came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.  Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against “NYPD Blue” – which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered – ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.  Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company’s onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.  He started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included “Columbo,” with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.  Bochco wrote such features as “The Movie Maker” and “Silent Running” before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including “Delvecchio,” a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came “Bay City Blues,” about a baseball team, which didn’t last.  With “Hill Street Blues,” Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like “Hill Street” and “Cheers” was rewarded after “The Cosby Show” premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.  Beyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on “Hill Street” and enlisting David E. Kelley — then a Boston lawyer — to work on “L.A. Law.”  When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as “the standard all television producers strive for.”  For all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire “Capitol Critters” to “Public Morals,” an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.  Although major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of “Commander in Chief” — an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president — and co-creating “Over There,” an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.  Bochco also produced the legal drama “Raising the Bar” for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.  The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing “Death by Hollywood,” a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, “Truth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,” which he self-published in 2016.  Bochco was loyal to his friends — certain actors appeared in his shows time and again — but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.  Bochco’s association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in “Hill Street Blues,” and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on “L.A. Law” as the wife of firm partner Douglas Brackman, played by her real-life husband (and thus Bochco’s brother-in-law), Alan Rachins. The producer later married Dayna Kalins, a TV executive. His son, Jesse, became a prominent director, working on many of his father’s shows.  Bochco was thrice married, the first time to Gabrielle Levin, the second to Bosson.  He is survived by his third wife Dayna Kalins, whom he married in 2000, as well children Melissa Bochco, Jesse Bochco and Sean Flanagan, and two grandchildren.\",\n",

She then posted, “My mom isn’t even friends with me on social media .. why does social media determine someone’s life?” which comes days after Radar reported that Evans unfollowed Eason on Instagram and that the couple aren’t Facebook friends.  Jenelle Evans/Instagram  Jenelle Evans/Instagram  Hours after dispelling the breakup rumors, Evans posted a video of two of her children and Eason, whom she wed in September 2017, at a Christmas tree lot.  “In the pines, trying to find a #ChristmasTree,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself and Eason embracing while looking for trees.  Evans’ posts come nearly two months after she placed a 911 call about Eason, alleging that he assaulted her.  PEOPLE confirmed that Evans was hospitalized. The chief of 911 operations for Columbus County, North Carolina, said that two police officers responded to a 911 call placed from the home of Evans and Eason on Oct. 13.  The call was placed by a female just before 10 p.m. and was “called in as an assault,” the chief said. An ambulance was also requested but later canceled, the chief said: “The female was transported to the hospital via private vehicle instead.”  A spokesperson for the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office told PEOPLE that no incident report was taken.  TMZ later posted audio of Evans’ 911 call, when she claimed that Eason injured her collarbone.

I can’t move my arm.”  RELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: ‘He Almost Knocked My Son Out’  A rep for Evans previously told PEOPLE that the MTV star “had friends over Saturday night and they had a bonfire on her property” and “Jenelle ended up tripping and falling by the fire.”  In a statement to E!

       " \"When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.  “I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they’re not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII’s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. “In the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,” Larcombe says, “and the person who is departing the royal family, they’re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they’re done behind closed doors.”\",\n",
       " \"Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to comedy legend Don Rickles on Thursday night’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC.  “This is not going to be our usual show tonight,” Kimmel said at the top of his monologue. “And I’ll tell you right up front that I’m going to cry — probably a lot, which is embarrassing. But I’m not good with this sort of thing and I’m sorry — especially to those of you who came here to see the show in person, because that’s probably not what you came for. But we lost someone that we and I love very much today.”  Rickles died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 90.  “I was fortunate enough to — not only have Don on this show as my guest — but also to become close to him and his wife Barbara, which was a lot of fun for me,” Kimmel said.  Kimmel described Rickles as a towering presence in Las Vegas, where Kimmel grew up, and where Rickles found his greatest success as a stand-up comic. He also described the first time Rickles — who rose to fame as a frequent guest on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show” — appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2006.  “It was so exciting,” Kimmel said. “I felt like I was in some kind of talk show host fantasy camp. Sitting behind a desk while Don Rickles made fun of me. It was like being a real talk show host for a minute. For twenty minutes, it was like being Johnny Carson.”  Rickles appeared on Kimmel’s show 17 times more in the years that followed.  Kimmel also talked about taking Rickles, famous for his insult comedy, out to Mario Batali’s Los Angeles restaurant Mozza. “We rented the private room in back,” Kimmel said. “We had food, I invited his friends — it was beautiful. It was very expensive. At the end of the meal, he said, ‘I can’t believe you took me to a pizza place.'”  Kimmel closed his monologue with a video tribute to Rickles, showing the best moments from the comedian’s appearance on the ABC show.

       " 'Earlier this year, Baywatch co-stars Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron were spotted shopping for pet toys together which sparked intense speculation that the two were dating.  The pair has denied it—insisting they’re just “very good friends.” But when it came to the very important decision of adopting a dog, Efron turned to none other than his friend Daddario.  \"He was in the market for [a dog], and it’s a big life decision,\" Daddario tells ELLE.com. \"He just wanted to make it as easy as possible.\"  Daddario and Efron found Maca, an adorable brown and black pit bull, at the LA-based rescue shelter called Bark n’ Bitches. The dog, who was named Tilly before Efron adopted her, was about to be euthanized before the shelter took her in.  W Blanco/Backgrid  \"Maca was being led to the kill room when we stepped in and said we would take her. She was turned around and brought to us!,\" Bark n\\' Bitches wrote on Instagram in April. \"This guy named Zac Efron came in (we hear he is an actor, but we think he actually waits tables) came in and fell in love.\"  Daddario has her own rescue pup: a sweet terrier mix named Levon.  \"I have an adopted dog and he\\'s my best friend. I found out what rescue shelter he was at, and it was love at first sight,” says Daddario, who first spotted Levon on Adopt-a-Pet.com. Now, the actress is partnering with Dogtrader.com—Autotrader’s new dog adoption website created with Adopt-a-Pet.com—to encourage more people to adopt rescues. “He had been neglected and it was such a great feeling to bring him into my home, and to see him get happier and happier, and to feel safer and safer, and see his personality come out more.”  It was Efron’s offer for a doggie date with Levon (and Daddario) that sparked romance rumors from fans. When Efron adopted MACA, he introduced her to the world with a sweet Instagram photo — and in the comments he tagged Daddario and said “doggie date?”  But the actress says she hasn’t taken him up on the offer.  \"I’ve been working a lot, so not recently,\" says Daddario, who starred in When We First Met earlier this year. \"Our lives get so crazy, and sometimes it’s hard to keep in touch with people. But you have to take the dog out on a hike every now and then, so sometimes with friends we’ll meet up.\"  \"When your friends’ dogs start to get to know each other and they either like each other or they don\\'t, it’s really cute to see,\" she adds. \"It’s like the precursor of children.\"  If Efron wants to take things out of the friendzone, we hope for his sake that Levon likes him.  \"I have this long-running joke that my dog has to like the guy I’m dating or else I can’t date him,\" Daddario says with a laugh. \"It’s only happened once that my dog really hated the guy I brought home. It was someone I dated for a while, and he just didn’t like him.\"',\n",
       " 'The pop star got engaged to her significant other Daryl Sabara at the end of last year, and she is keen to tie the knot in a ‘chilled’ ceremony in her own backyard.  LONDON - Meghan Trainor is planning to have a winter wedding.  The 24-year-old pop star got engaged to her significant other Daryl Sabara at the end of last year, and she is keen to tie the knot in a “chilled” ceremony in her own backyard around 12 months after he got down on one knee.  She said: “I was thinking, my backyard’s real pretty. Like, real beautiful. And I just want it be chill and with my family in the backyard so I think I’m going to do that around Christmas time because it’s my favourite.  “My mom is like, ‘Stop telling them.’ It’ll be fine mom. No one knows where I live. Maybe.”  The No Excuses hitmaker admits she and Sabara have adopted a more positive outlook since she shot to fame, and the couple were so pleased to be heading to New York to film the morning news programme.  Speaking on the Today Show on NBC, which co-hosting the programme alongside Hoda Kotb, she added: “I’m so happy.  “We’re saying that a lot more now. Like, ‘Wow, what are we doing here?’ “  Trainor recently said she wants her wedding to be a “casual” affair, and she is keen to put on a barbecue for all her guests.  She said: “I think I’m just gonna be casual. I think I’m just gonna do it in my backyard. I’ve got a great yard and my manager, like, legally can marry people.  “Yeah, I just might have my best friend do it and we might just chill and have like a barbecue. I don’t know!”  The star recently admitted she wanted to “lock” Sabara down into picking a date for their nuptials.  She told BANG Showbiz: “It’s that cheesy line of ‘You know when you know’ and that’s so real because I’ve never had anything like this with any other human, I’ve never not got sick of someone. I’ve been with him literally every day and I’m not sick of him, and I miss him when he’s not in my visual sight, it’s gross.”',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Lawrence is peak Jennifer Lawrence during interviews. Ever since her Hunger Games days she\\'s been known to deliver an A-plus soundbite (or seven) during them. And her recent chat with Ellen DeGeneres was no exception. The Red Sparrow actress stopped by The Ellen Show on Friday (March 2) and wound up telling everyone about her drunk alter-ego named Gail.  \"I can\\'t go on a vacation right now, because I just can\\'t deal with \\'Gail\\' at the moment,\" she said. \"I need to rest before \\'Gail.\\'\"  So who is \"Gail,\" exactly? Well, according to Lawrence , she comes out only during \"a very specific drunk\" period. \"It\\'s not just every time I\\'m drunk, I turn into this \\'Gail,\\'\" she said. \"I think she\\'s some sort of like tortoise gambler, or something. I don\\'t always turn into this masculine alter-ego that jumps into shark-ridden waters just to make my friends laugh.\" That\\'s a true story, by the way: Lawrence—or shall we say Gail?—actually did jump into shark-infested waters while on vacation. \"My friends were like, \\'That\\'s too far, Jen, like no. Not funny.\\'\"  Lawrence suggested it\\'s rum that really makes Gail come out, so of course DeGeneres gave her some to drink during their chat. \"I\\'m normally, like, pretty cautious,\" Lawrence said. \"And then I get some rum in me and I\\'m like, \\'Let\\'s arm wrestle!\\'\"  DeGeneres then pulled up a picture of Gail, who was smiling at the camera in a very particular way Lawrence couldn\\'t re-create sober. Incredible. \"I was trying to look cute,\" she said. \"I was, like, getting photographed with all my girlfriends on the beach. I wanted to look cute!… My whole face is just crooked…. The hair, too, just so presidential.\"  Watch Lawrence explain all this yourself, below.  I now want to kick back with both Jennifer Lawrence and Gail at the same time. How can I make that happen?',\n",
       " 'On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley’s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.  “I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,” she wrote on Wednesday. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”  She continued to call the discussions “sexist,” saying they were “creating silly distractions from real issues.”  “Get a grip people,” she finished. “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”  Lawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timothée Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both “hot” and “talented.”  “Timothée, I’m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?” she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. “[I’m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I’m going to swing right in there as soon as he’s, like, 30.”',\n",
       " \"Scheana Marie, the waitress whom Eddie cheated on Brandi with, now claims that he tried to reignite their relationship after he began seeing LeAnn! Do you believe it?  Eddie Cibrian is no saint, that’s for sure, but could he possibly have been foolish enough to try and cheat on now-wife LeAnn Rimes with the same waitress he cheated on ex-wife Brandi Glanville? If the waitress in question, Scheana Marie, is to be believed, the answer is a resounding yes!  In a new interview with RadarOnline.com, Scheana, 27, claims that Eddie, 39, contacted her after he split with Brandi, 40, in 2009. According to the waitress, who now stars on Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules, Eddie was already dating LeAnn, 30.  “As months go by, Eddie gets separated. He then contacts me to go out for drinks,” Scheana says. “I believed he was separated, so I was happy to go out with him again. But shortly into trying to hang out with him I find out about LeAnn, and I felt like such an idiot!”  Scheana Marie Recalls Meeting Eddie Cibrian  Scheana spoke with the website about when she first met Eddie and revealed the surprising source who informed her about Eddie’s lies. “Originally, I met him seven years ago. When a really good-looking guy with big dimples wants to take you out for drinks your first question isn’t ‘Are you married because you don’t have a ring on your finger?'” she says.  “We hung out, it was quite casual and about six months in, my mom saw an article and was like, ‘That Eddie guy you are dating, is his last name Cibrian and is he on Third Watch?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, what do you hear?’ And she told me that he and his wife are expecting their second child!”  Scheana Confronts Eddie About His Lies  Scheana says that she confronted the philandering actor to find out the truth, and he admitted to his lies via text message! “He was like, ‘I’m so sorry I lied to you.’ He then switched the conversation and said, ‘By the way, are you still doing the acting thing? I have a project I’m funding, and there’s a role for you that would be great.'”  The waitress-turned-reality star says that, since their last run-in, she and Eddie haven’t spoken. “I have no interest in talking to him again,” she says.

       " 'CLOSE It\\'s now \\'Live with Kelly and Ryan.\\' USA TODAY  \\'Live With Kelly and Ryan\\' began with new permanent co-host Ryan Seacrest on Monday. (Photo: Disney/ABC)  He\\'s been a fixture on the red carpet during big Hollywood awards ceremonies. Now get ready for Ryan Seacrest to be a fixture on the morning-show circuit as Kelly Ripa\\'s new partner.  Nearly a year after Michael Strahan left his seat next to Ripa on her weekday talk show, she announced that former American Idol host Seacrest is her new co-host. And so Live With Kelly has become Live With Kelly and Ryan.  The popular morning show with Ripa is distributed by Disney | ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. It is produced by WABC-TV in New York and competes in many markets against the third hour of NBC\\'s Today. Seacrest, whose industry credits includes both television and radio gigs as well as producing reality TV series, is not new to ABC as he is host of the network\\'s annual broadcast of Dick Clark\\'s Rockin Eve on New Year\\'s Eve.  CNN reported the Seacrest news ahead of Monday\\'s show. It was confirmed early during Live\\'s broadcast. The two appeared together and he told her, \"So happy. So excited.\"  But she\\'s suffered without a permanent co-host: Ratings for Live! are down 18%, to an average of 3.2 million viewers, a steeper decline than any other syndicated talk show.  Ripa posted a video to Twitter on Sunday afternoon in which she took a sip from a Live with Kelly mug that also included a question mark. She said in the video, \"Tune in tomorrow. Trust me.\"  Kelly Ripa arrives at the Oscars at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles Feb. 26, 2017. (Photo: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)  The show said it was \"growing to two\" on Twitter. Another post had \"announce co-host\" on Ripa\\'s \"to do\" list.  News of Strahan\\'s exit for Good Morning America last May led Ripa to skip the show for two days in protest of the way the situation was handled.  Numerous celebrities have filled in as co-hosts with Ripa over the past year, including Jerry O\\'Connell, Fred Savage and Andy Cohen.

       " 'Prodigy‘s cause of death was revealed as accidental choking, the Clark County coroner’s office confirmed to TMZ on Thursday, August 3.  According to the outlet, the Mobb Deep rapper choked while eating an egg. He died at the age of 42 on June 20 at a Las Vegas hospital, where he was being treated for complications from sickle cell anemia.  “It is with extreme sadness and disbelief that we confirm the death of our dear friend Albert Johnson, better known to millions of fans as Prodigy of legendary NY rap duo Mobb Deep,” a publicist for the hip-hop group confirmed in a statement to Rolling Stone at the time. “Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth. The exact causes of death have yet to be determined. We would like to thank everyone for respecting the family’s privacy at this time.”  A public memorial service was held for Prodigy at New York City’s Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on June 29. The stars in attendance included fellow Mobb Deep rapper Havoc, The Roots drummer Questlove, Fat Joe, 50 Cent and Remy Ma.  The “Quiet Storm” rapper performed his final concert at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center on June 17, just three days before his death.  Prodigy is survived by wife Ikesha Dudley, son T’Shaka, daughter Fahtasia, brother Greg, stepdaughter Kiejzonna and step-granddaughter Brooklyn Harris.

       " 'Home for the spring holidays! The night before Easter, admirably friendly exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon reunited to celebrate with their 5-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan. The “Emotions” singer took to Instagram to post a sweet snap of the family decorating Easter eggs . In the adorable photo, the family of four sits around a kitchen table dying eggs in all sorts of pastel colors for Easter. “Easter with #demkids,” she shared with her followers. “#moments #rocandroe #easter #family @nickcannon.”  Looks like the pop-megastar is trying to change the nickname of her growing twins to #demkids, who have been referred to by fans as #dembabies since their birth in 2012. The duo were married in April of 2008 but the “Honey” singer filed for divorce December of 2014.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SZfWl8gS/  Carey and Cannon’s Easter celebration just a week after the “Glitter” actress announced she had split from backup dancer, Bryan Tanka after a year of dating. According to TMZ, Tanaka felt “disrespected” when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SjBrF1Et/  The “Butterfly” singer also suffered heartbreak in October of 2016 after confirming her breakup with Australian billionaire, James Packer. The former couple had been together ever since being introduced to each other by their mutual friend, producer Brett Ratner, at the premiere of 2014’s Hercules.  Cannon has also had some big life changes this year after becoming a father for the third time over announcing the birth of his son Golden “Sagon” Cannon on his Instagram Page on Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Wild ’N’ Out star captioned the photo. “Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose! #TrueHappiness, welcome to Earth Son!” added Cannon, 36.

       " \"The loved-up pair put on a major display of affection as they bid each other an emotional farewell after spending a few days together in the capital.  Bradley, 40, is currently in the UK ahead of his stint in The Elephant Man at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, which kicks off next week.

       " \"In the months since President Donald Trump took office, his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has become one of his father’s most vocal supporters — and Twitter defenders.  The president returned the favor on Tuesday and Wednesday, coming to his son’s defense after his namesake seemingly embroiled himself more deeply in the ongoing Russian collusion investigation by releasing emails detailing how he eagerly set up a meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who allegedly promised damaging information on his father’s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton.  “My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,” the president said in a statement delivered by his principal deputy press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, at an off-camera press briefing Tuesday afternoon.  Trump followed up on Twitter early Wednesday, praising his son’s interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity overnight. Trump Jr. admitted during the show that “in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.”  “My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!” Trump tweeted.  Trump Jr., 39, first emerged as one of father’s fiercest defenders during the presidential campaign — and before that worked side-by-side with his dad while running the family business — but the pair haven’t always been as close are they are today.  Ron Galella, Ltd./WireImage  As a preteen, Trump Jr.’s relationship with his father was fraught following Trump’s separation from his first wife, Ivana Trump, the mother of eldest children Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric.  Trump Jr. was 12 at the time and didn’t speak to his father for a year after the highly publicized split, New York magazine reported in a 2004 article about the Trump children.  Trump Jr. told the magazine that at the time he blamed the divorce on his father, who had been having an affair with model Marla Maples. But he added that in retrospect he may have been “manipulated” into that belief by his mother.  “Listen, it’s tough to be a 12-year-old. You’re not quite a man, but you think you are. You think you know everything. Being driven into school every day and you see the front page and it’s divorce! THE BEST SEX I EVER HAD! And you don’t even know what that means,” he said, referencing the heavy gossip-column coverage of his parents’ split, some of which was encouraged by his father.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Ron Galella/WireImage  After his parents’ divorce, Trump Jr. and his brother Eric were shipped off to boarding school, the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, to remove them from the New York society scene, according to Vanity Fair.  At school, Trump Jr. practiced skeet shooting, and — unlike his father — seemed to enjoy life outside the spotlight.  “When I went to boarding school, it all kind of went away — all those inconveniences that I found intrusive,” he told New York in 2004.  Andrew Savulich/NY Daily News Archive/Getty  Trump Jr. also told The New York Times in March that he decided early on not to measure himself against his father.  ”I think people are often surprised, but I never defined myself as, ‘I’m the business guy who has to supersede what my father has done,’ ” he said. ”He’s a totally unique individual. Somehow having to top his accomplishments is never the way I perceived things.”  As a child, Trump Jr. found a role model not in his father but in his maternal grandfather, Milos Zelnicek, an electrician and avid outdoorsman. In the summers, Trump Jr. stayed at his grandparents’ home outside Prague for six to eight weeks at a time, where his grandfather taught him how to camp, fish, hunt and speak Czech, the Times reported.  ”He needed a father figure,” Ivana told the newspaper in a telephone interview. ”Donald was not around that much. They would have to go to his office to say hello to him before going to school.” (Ivana also once hinted at her ex-husband’s alleged barely-there parenting by saying: “When [my children] turned 21, I handed them over to him and said, ‘Here’s the finished product.’ “)  RELATED VIDEO: Donald Trump Jr. Changes Account of Russian Lawyer Meeting  Trump Jr. went on to attend father’s alma mater, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was by all accounts (including his own) a big partier who “had a reputation” for getting into “drunken, ‘do-you-have-any-idea-who-I-am?’ fights,” according to New York.  Vanity Fair reported that Scott Melker, a Penn classmate, wrote on Facebook, “Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around on campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking. He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him.”  Melker also described an alleged incident in which Trump showed up to his son’s dorm room to take him to a Yankees game. Trump Jr. was dressed in a Yankees jersey and when he opened the door to his father, “without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said, ‘Put on a suit and meet me outside,’ and closed the door.” A spokesperson for the Trump family told Vanity Fair this story is “completely false.”  After graduating, Trump Jr. initially declined to join the family business, instead moving to Aspen, Colorado, where he hunted, fished, camped, lived out of the back of a truck, and bartended, according to Vanity Fair — which also reported that Trump Jr. stopped talking to his father during this time.  RELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: Natasha Stoynoff Speaks Out: ‘I Don’t Want Women to Feel Afraid’  Several months later, on Feb. 25, 2001, Trump Jr. was arrested for public drunkenness during a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. He spent 11 hours in jail.  Like his teetotaler father, Trump Jr. no longer drinks. But he attributes this not to inspiration from his father but rather to the discipline of the sporting life. ”I know that the benefits I got from being in the woods, from being in a duck blind, from being in a tree stand at 5 o’clock in the morning, kept me out of so much other trouble I would have gotten into in my life,” Trump Jr. said in a speech at a 2016 fundraiser.  After returning from Aspen in 2001, Trump Jr. went to work at the Trump Organization, where he climbed the ranks to executive vice president. During his first big project, the Trump Park Avenue, he clashed with his father on the decor (the elder Trump insisted on gold doorknobs), The Washington Post reported. After the project was completed, Trump Jr. jokingly asked his father to put “Trump Junior” on the facade, but his father refused.  In 2003, Trump introduced his son to his future wife, former model Vanessa Haydon, at a fashion show. Trump proposed with a ring from the Bailey, Banks & Biddle jewelry store in Short Hills, New Jersey, in exchange for publicity, and was later mocked in the New York Post, which ran the story with the headline: ”Trump Jr. Is the Cheapest Gazillionaire: Heirhead Proposes With Free 100G Ring.” (The couple went on to have five children, now between the ages of 10 and 3.)  According to Vanity Fair, Trump also publicly criticized his son at the time, saying on CNN’s Larry King Live: ”You have a name that is hot as a pistol, you have to be very careful with things like this.”  Ethan Miller/Getty  Despite their sometimes-rocky relationship, Trump Jr. has been nothing but supportive since his father launched his presidential bid, joining him on the campaign trail and using Twitter to lash out at his father’s many critics.  Trump Jr.’s interest in hunting and close friendships with gun enthusiasts and people who enjoy the outdoors — so foreign from the New York elite world his father long operated in — have endeared him to some conservatives and to his father’s Middle America supporters while also riling animal rights activists who criticized his big game hunting trips in Africa.

Here's Donald Trump Jr. holding the tail of an elephant (party symbol) that he killed. #TrumpSacrifices pic.twitter.com/FIGkcH2F0t — xoxo, Jane (@PoodleMama1966) July 31, 2016  After delivering a rousing speech at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, he was embraced as a rising Republican political star and applauded for his poise and focus — qualities not usually attributed to his father.  Though it may not seem like it based on his politics-focused Twitter activity, Trump Jr. maintains that his focus these days is on running the Trump Organization. He has claimed several times that he has barely spoken to his father since he took office in January.  In March, amid criticism that his father had not sufficiently removed himself from his businesses, Trump Jr. said at a GOP fundraiser that he’d had virtually ”zero contact” with the president since the election. He insisted to The New York Times later that month, ”I haven’t spoken to him. Maybe just to say hello. It feels trite. I feel ridiculous bothering him.”  Critics were quick to point out that Trump Jr. had recently joined his father for his announcement of Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil M. Gorsuch in late January.  “Where is the break point?” Trump Jr. said when asked about this by the Times. ”If I see him once a month, is that too much? Once a year? My point is, it’s a no-win scenario. But, in the end, we both fully recognize that what he is doing now is far more important than absolutely anything going on in the business. And we will conduct ourselves accordingly.”  Now, Trump Jr. has a much bigger issue to worry about as he faces widespread criticism, allegations of treason and potential legal troubles over his June 2016 meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. There’s a growing call for Trump Jr. to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about his email exchange on the meeting, which he said he’d be “happy” to do.  Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know. https://t.co/tL47NOoteM — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017  The fallout from the revelation that Trump Jr. met with the Russian lawyer (who has since denied any alleged ties to the Russian government) has prompted critics to say that the businessman has never seemed more like his father’s son.  .@DonaldJTrumpJr is a great example of the maxim that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. https://t.co/IFjNh5wMY9 — Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) July 10, 2017  Like father, like son (and son-in-law) https://t.co/8qhVOFUjjO — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) July 11, 2017  Where there's smoke there's fire.

       " 'The feud continues between these frenemies.  Days after Kim Zolciak-Biermann was accused by fellow Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes of being a “racist,” the mother of six has obtained legal counsel, PEOPLE confirms. (A rep for Leakes had no comment.)  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She put #KKK on the Instagram post. I’ve hired legal counsel at this point. It’s just that bad,” she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.  “It’s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,” said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn’t seen Leakes since the feud ignited. “I’m on a show with all African-American women and I’m the only one that’s ever been on the show that’s Caucasian, so it’s the card that sometimes they play and it’s gross. And I won’t allow it.”  “I probably won’t shoot with her again,” she shared.  “I don’t take this lightly. It’s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,” Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!’s Daily Pop on Tuesday. “This is far beyond just having an opinion.”  The reality star’s decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.  On Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of “prejudice” after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes’ home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.  In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.  “@briellebiermann We don’t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f—ing with me and mine!” Leakes wrote in the comments section.  “Go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn’t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,” she concluded.  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter’s Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar ‘Racist’  Also on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a “black roach.”  “I’m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f—. doesn’t matter if you’re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don’t f—ing clean ur s—!!! #callorkinpls,” the eldest Biermann child wrote.  Then, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo “racists.”  “Kim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,” Leakes wrote, adding, “children are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.”  Zolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.  “First off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM’s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!” Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.  “Brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,” Zolciak-Biermann concluded.  In a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.  “It’s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that’s her last resort. (It’s convenient that I’m not racist when we are getting along.),” she said.  “In a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it’s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she’s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!”  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ for Season 10!  Later, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann’s post with another statement of her own.  “Kim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim’s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree’s plus 1. She is a huge lier,” Leakes wrote.  “All this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go!

       " 'If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: “There’s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what’s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,” and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, “It’s all in God’s hands always,” along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, “That was aimed directly at Alex.”  Hollywood’s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he’s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months — including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, “someone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that’s what made Jennifer lose it,” the insider tells In Touch. “Of course, he said it wasn’t physical, and maybe it wasn’t, but in Jennifer’s book, that’s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex’s actions have jeopardized everything.”  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who’s endured three failed marriages, “was heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,” says the insider. “Even though they didn’t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex’s antics.”  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. “A week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,” she claimed. “He never even mentioned her.” Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer “would be an idiot to believe he’d be faithful,” she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” she dished. “In bed... he\\'s probably picturing me.\"  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she’s not sure what to believe. “Jennifer’s still on the fence,” says the insider. “She can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she’ll fight for it.”  More from In Touch  Alex Rodriguez Encourages New Girlfriend Jennifer Lopez to “Sex up” Her Wardrobe (EXCLUSIVE)  Jennifer Lopez Hints That She Has Made a Sex Tape — Watch the Scandalous Clip!

       " \"When you get the chance to make a Star Wars film and have been a fan of the saga your whole life, it's hard to pass up an opportunity to appear on screen . The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson might not have appeared in his film in an immediately recognizable capacity, but confirmed on the film's commentary track that he grasps Han Solo's golden dice from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in a close-up shot.  After clashing with Rey on Ahch-To, Luke Skywalker boards the Falcon in an emotional scene, reflecting on his former ally Han Solo having been killed by Kylo Ren. Upon discovering the dice, Luke takes them from where they hung on the ship and pockets them, ultimately handing them over to his sister Leia in the film's final act.  Actor Mark Hamill filmed a majority of this scene, yet Johnson couldn't help but take advantage of the opportunity to lend his own talents to the film by sporting a glove to clutch the dice in the quick shot.  This is Johnson's second appearance in the Star Wars saga, as he was also a Death Star gunner in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The filmmaker returned the favor to Rogue One director Gareth Edwards, who made an appearance as a Resistance trooper during the battle of Crait .  Johnson managed to sneak in quite a few cameos in The Last Jedi, with some being more obvious than others. Actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Noah Segan, who have appeared in all of Johnson's films, both made brief appearances, with Gordon-Levitt lending just his voice to an alien character while Segan played a Resistance pilot.  Tom Hardy, Take That singer Gary Barlow, and Princes Harry and William all shared a scene together where they played Stormtroopers, yet the scene was reportedly absent from the final cut.  Star Wars fans may have recognized saga staple Warwick Davis' voice during the Canto Bight scene, as the actor voiced one of the aliens in the casino. Even Mark Hamill earned an additional role, providing the vocalizations for the alien who attempts to put coins in BB-8.  You can get The Last Jedi on Digital HD now and on Blu-ray March 27th.

       " 'Wednesday afternoon, Olympic gold medalist and gymnastics phenom Simone Biles tweeted this:  there is a gavin meme for everything — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 10, 2016  Ah, yes, Gavin. The guy we all know and love. Gavin!  Still confused? Biles’s teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.  when you win a gold medal at the Olympics: pic.twitter.com/tyhs9gD0ya — Laurie Hernandez (@LaurieHernandez) August 10, 2016  There he is! Gavin.  At a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.  Well, “some kid” is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine’s earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral “Suck a Dick” vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.  “Not the most family-friendly thing we’ve ever made,” Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, “but most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time — he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn’t really take notice of him a whole lot.”  In the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn’t expecting much of a response, but it blew up.  “People started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,” he recalls. “And I was like, Let’s find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it’s just something he seems to be good at without even trying.”  Gavin kept appearing on Nick’s Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. “It wasn’t up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.” Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin’s spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.  With dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.  In addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.  The attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles’s are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. “Those types of things are just fun,” Mastodon says, “because they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that’s really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.”  “I think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,” he said. “There was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there’s Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.”  When you send a risky text and 5 mins later you open up messages and see the three little dots pic.twitter.com/5tgXnVDlIu — Gavin Reactions (@GavinReacts) August 1, 2016  Exactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. “The only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,” Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin’s college fund. “I think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what’s happening or how it happens. I’m hoping that he thinks it’s cool. I’m hoping that it’s not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.”  For the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence. All hail #KingGavin.',\n",

While appearing on Bravo\\'s \"Watch What Happens Live\" on Thursday, Lawrence answered questions from fans who called in, and one viewer from Pennsylvania asked if the reports of her dating Pitt were true. Lawrence denied them, and explained that they only met once a few years ago.  Even though the speculation was false, she admitted that she didn\\'t mind being paired with Pitt.  \"No,\" she said. \"I\\'ve met him once in like, 2013, so it was very random, but I also wasn\\'t like, in a hurry to debunk it.\"  Speculation of Lawrence and Pitt dating surfaced in December 2017, with reports stating that Pitt \"had his eye on Jennifer for years\" and they were \"enjoying lots of late nights together.\"  Lawrence has been single since she split with Darren Aronofsky, who directed \"Mother!,\" in 2017 and Pitt has been single since he split with Angelina Jolie in 2016.  Lawrence also isn\\'t the first actor to be linked to Pitt. In November 2017, Kate Hudson appeared on \"Watch What Happens Live\" and addressed the reports that she was dating Pitt. Like Lawrence, she didn\\'t seem to mind the report and called it \"kind of awesome.\"  \"I kind of liked it,\" Hudson said. \"I was like, \\'OK, fine.

On the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of TBS’ new sketch show, Drop the Mic, which pins two celebs up against each other in an epic rap battle, both Berry and Corden got in some personal digs.  It all began with Berry’s career choices. “Let’s not pretend that Catwoman didn’t suck. Halle, that was a Batman movie, how’d you mess that up?” Corden began. However, she was ready!  “I’m glad Swordfish was to your satisfaction. It’s probably the only time your d-ck has seen some action,” she rapped. “Yes, everybody knows Catwoman tanked, but I took Kingsman to the mother f-ckin’ bank… James has a Tony, that’s cool and all. But I have an Oscar, so suck my monster balls.”  From there, he got personal.  “Halle is a classic. This whole thing’s tragic. You’re just Viola Davis but not as charismatic,” he rapped. “Sure you won an Oscar but I question the voters. I use my Gothica DVD as a drink coaster… 2008 you were Sexiest Woman Alive. Was that a moment when Beyoncé briefly died?”  The late night host ended with the divorce jokes, while she ended with a sex dig.  “When it comes to getting married, three divorces is enough. Forget signing autographs. Sign a prenup,” he said. “You’ve done so many X-Men movies, maybe a dozen. I heard X-Men and I thought it was about your husbands.”  “Now, why are you so angry and pushy? Of course, you hated Catwoman you never get p–sy,” Berry said.  In the end, she was named the clear winner.  Drop the Mic airs on TBS on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET.

       " 'Thursday, September 14, 2017 at 8:45PM  our ongoing adventures at TIFF. An abdriged version of this review was originally published in Nathaniel\\'s column at Towleroad.  Film festivals nearly always provide curious dialogues between films that you weren\\'t expecting. On the same day on the exact same screen at TIFF I managed to see two films about female writers and the male writers in their lives who take up all the oxygen (and praise) in the room. Who would have thought that a film about the origins of Frankenstein (just discussed) and a star vehicle for Glenn Close in Stockholm would have so much in common?  THE WIFE (Björn Runge)  Joan Castleman (Glenn Close) is a longsuffering wife who would bristle at that very description. She\\'s married to a famous novelist Joe Castleman (Jonathan Pryce) and their homophonic names are no coincidence. The silver-haired couple have been together for nearly half a century and are inseparable if not quite interchangeable...  As The Wife begins we learn that Joe has just been named the Nobel prize winner in literature and the couple are to travel to Stockholm together for the ceremony. They\\'re so happy they actually jump on their bed together in a singularly charming scene. This slow burn story may start out playful but it deepens as it goes thanks to Close\\'s brilliant work.  the younger and the older CastlemansAll the principle characters in Joe\\'s orbit also happen to be writers and resent him, if not quite his enormous success, for different reasons: his son David (Max Irons) never gets the encouragement he needs, his wife Joan was a promising writer who set her own career aside when she married him, and then there\\'s Nathaniel (Christian Slater) who\\'s been trailing the family for years trying to get permission to write Joe\\'s biography.  The cracks in the happy marriage facade begin to show as the Nobel ceremony nears and flashbacks pile up. Annie Starke, Close\\'s own daughter, plays her as a young college student and Elizabeth McGoven gives great cameo as an aggressive lady author who warns her away from the sexist literary world which just won\\'t let women succeed. Björn Runge, a Swedish director making his first English language film, doesn\\'t find many ways to visualize all of the drama - it\\'s mostly two or more characters arguing in rooms, planes, or hotels, but he\\'s great with the actors who all deliver in this adaptation of Meg Wolitzer\\'s bestseller.  The interpersonal dynamics and face-offs are the savory meat of the film. To my personal astonishment Glenn Close restricts herself to chewing on it rather than the scenery! Put simply it\\'s the best work she\\'s done in over 20 years.  Close\\'s opacity as an actress, the unknowability of that glacial face, has often been disguised by her sheer volume and ferocity in so many gorgon roles. Here in Joan\\'s quieter less sinister register, she\\'s spectacular. You constantly attempt to figure Joan out but Joan will not have it. She prefers to remain a mystery, hiding her true feelings from everyone, including possibly herself. Her mercurial moods will shift within scenes; just when you expect her to double down on anger she\\'ll throw compassion at you, and vice versa, keeping you off balance. At one point in a brilliantly acted private \\'date\\' with that would-be biographer, she says \"I\\'m shy\" with something like mock flirtation. It sounds like a lie, but it\\'s actually the truth of this mesmerizing character.  The film isn\\'t quite as coy as Close, eventually revealing its hand. Joan Castleman and her poker face would not approve. But that, in a nutshell, is the satisfying friction of the film, a star vehicle wherein the star keeps threatening to jump from her own limo.  On set filming The Wife with the stunning and talented Glenn Close and her dog Pip. A post shared by Christian Slater (@realchristianslater) on Nov 16, 2016 at 11:11am PST    Grades: Glenn Close A; Film B  Oscar Potential: A probable Best Actress nomination for Close if the film finds distribution in time.',\n",

Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers. Orlando Bloom (Photo: WireImage)  Movies  'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007). ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe.

       " 'Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse.…They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that \"when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice.\" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  \"She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,\" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because \"Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears.\" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. \"She’s more humiliated than ever,\" says the source. \"Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.\"  She’s put up with so much already. \"Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,\" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f--- Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: \"They’re taking this very seriously.\" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. \"This is most definitely a family crisis,\" says the insider. \"Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up.\" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  \"Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,\" says the source, \"but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems.\" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. \"It’s way less stressful,\" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. \"She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.\"  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have \"a third failed marriage under her belt,\" says the insider, \"there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown. It’s time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.\"  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!

He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don’t mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‘liked’ numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‘Trump Resistance Movement’, ‘Things Trump Supporters Say’, ‘US Democratic Socialists’, ‘Progressive Politics’, and ‘Jeremy Corbyn’.Some of Jameson’s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‘Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‘Islam – Religion of Peace’ and ‘Stunning Hijabs’, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.Jameson’s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‘European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists’ details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.FBI field report: Antifa has improvised explosives stored on college campuses.

Franco was criticized on Twitter for wearing a Time\\'s Up pin at the awards show in support of the movement to fight sexual harassment by a handful of women who claimed he\\'d behaved inappropriately in the past.  \"Things that I heard were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\\'t have a voice for so long,\\'\\' Franco told Colbert on Tuesday. \"I don\\'t want to shut them down in any way. I think it\\'s a good thing and I support it.\"  Colbert asked Franco if it\\'s possible for there to be reconciliation between his thoughts about what happened and the accusations leveled against him.  \"If there\\'s restitution to be made, I will make it,\\'\\' Franco said after a long pause. \"If I\\'ve done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.\"  On a night when he won a best actor award for his role in \"The Disaster Artist,\" the 39-year-old was called out on Twitter by actresses Violet Paley and Sarah Tither-Kaplan for what they described as sexually inappropriate and exploitative behavior.

       " \"Teresa Giudice isn’t looking to have another day in court. Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.  As previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, “Dinner with a great friend getting great advice” before quickly changing it to “Dinner with a great friend lots of laughs” with the hashtag “#webothlovefood.”  During Teresa’s Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. “I was helping her. Just in case – If anybody’s getting divorced, she’s a great divorce attorney to call,” she explained. “Get it? I was helping her.”  Gorga, 38, chimed in, “Oh, you’re saying you were publicizing her,” to which Teresa said, “Yes! Capisce? Capisce.”  “What’s the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,” Teresa continued. “Talking about growing up?”  Gorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. “I was like, ‘Who are you?’ and she was like, ‘I’m so and so’ and Teresa’s like, ‘She’s a divorce attorney,’ and I’m like, ‘Huh?’”  During the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn’t visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. “My mom got sick, so I didn’t see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,” she said. “I remember the one day I was going to see him, that’s when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.”  “Then there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren’t allowed to go see him,” she continued. “Oh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!”  However, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn’t exactly eager to return to jail – even to visit Joe. “You know, I don’t really enjoy going there,” she said. “Even when I was [in prison], I was like, ‘Don’t come!'”  The couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality’s attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. “I don’t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain’t happening. Period,” Leonard told Us Weekly exclusively. “Why can’t people accept the fact that these two people simply want to stay married to one another and let them live their lives?”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\",\n",

An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an “equity rider” in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood’s profound gender imbalance.  In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, “It’s great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.”  Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves’ The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution.',\n",

During the welcome ceremony leading up to the dinner, Melania Trump stole headlines, wearing a crisp white Michael Kors Collection suit with a matching white hat, custom-made by her personal couturier.

       " 'Hoda Kotb is a longtime news contributor and personality for NBC. In January 2018, she was named co-host of the opening hours of the network\\'s flagship morning program, \\'Today.\\'  Who Is Hoda Kotb?  Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today\\'s 10 a.m. time slot. Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show\\'s opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, making this the first time two females have hosted together in Today\\'s history.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  \\'Today\\' Co-Host  On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC’s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie.  Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today’s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  \\'Dateline\\' to Kathie Lee Cohort  Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008.  Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010.  Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing  Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who \"wanted us to be red, white and blue.\" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt.  After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech University. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986.  Early Career  Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents\\' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998.  Breast Cancer Survivor  Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram.  Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word \"forward\" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.  After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Awards and Other Endeavors  In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys.  Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016) .  The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015.

       " 'Brad Pitt can’t catch a break this year. It was recently revealed that the divorced actor is currently mourning the shocking loss of both Soundgarden rocker Chris Cornell and Paramount’s Brad Grey.  As Radar readers know, Cornell, 52, was found dead on the bathroom floor of his hotel room after an apparent suicide. Meanwhile, last weekend, Grey, the former Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO, died of cancer. He was just 59.  “He is devastated and in shock,” a source told E!

Skinny Brad Pitt Barely Fits Into His Suit On NYC Outing  “With Brad Grey, Brad Pitt was one of the few people who knew he was sick. Grey was told he had a few weeks to live, but he didn’t even get that long. He was gone way too soon,” the insider added.  Of course, Pitt has had his own issues to deal with in recent months.  Following his shocking split from Angelina Jolie, the 53-year-old kicked healthy living into high gear. Sources say the actor will do whatever it takes to win back the love of his ex-wife and six kids – even if that means giving up booze forever.

       " 'Share Us.A 78-year old retired officer of the CIA, Normand Hodges, has made a series of astonishing confessions. He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.Hodges says he has no regrets.He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.Hodges had worked for the CIA.Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.“We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage? Let us know your thoughts!',\n",

The 23-time Grand Slam winner said on Snapchat she is “super close” to returning to her championship form five months after she gave birth to her first child.  Her post read in part:  “My coach and team always said ‘only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way’. I can compete – but I don’t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time. With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I’ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.    “The memory of last year’s Open is one that I will carry with me, and Olympia and I look forward to coming back again. I appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the Australian Open.”  The Australian Open begins Jan. 15. Williams’s victory last year was her seventh in Melbourne and her last Grand Slam victory before the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.  The Australian Open tweeted best wishes shortly after her announcement, saying in part: \"Good luck for the rest of 2018, Serena!

In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Tiger Beer in efforts to spread awareness of the decreasing population of the tigers in the wild, she is urging her fans to participate in the #3890TIGERS campaign.  VanCamp recently talked to E! News about the campaign, sharing that the number of tigers left in the wild has lowered down to less than 4,000.  \"To put that in perspective, there are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild—that\\'s not only shocking, it\\'s heartbreaking. These are incredible creatures at the top of the food chain, yet as powerful as they are, they still our need protection,\" the actress told the news outlet.  As to what the goal of this campaign is, VanCamp stated that the organization aims to double the wild tiger population within five years.  She added, \"With Global Tiger Day this Saturday, we really want to raise awareness for our goal to double the wild tiger population by the next year of Zodiac Tiger in 2022. I also happen to have been born in 1986, another year of the Tiger, so to be able to lend my voice to the wild tigers who have none, means a lot to me and brings it all full circle.\"  The fans had noticed that the Canadian actress stayed off social media for a while, even removing her profile picture. Recently, on Instagram, she posted an art with a portrait image of her and a tiger. She explained that the purpose of her disappearance was to raise awareness for the disappearance of these majestic animals.  In the caption, she also urged her followers to participate in the campaign by deleting their profile pictures, creating tiger-related art, or making a donation to the rangers that are responsible for keeping the tiger safe in the wild.

Beyoncé took a strong stance on Kaepernick’s actions to protest police brutality at the 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Awards Show in New York. Kaepernick’s decision to remain seated while the national anthem played back in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to incite controversy in the present.  “Thank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction,” the “Lemonade” singer said in her presentation speech. “Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color.”  “We’re still waiting for the world to catch up. It’s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let’s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let’s not get that mistaken.”  Related Two Beyonce Albums Leak Onto Streaming Services — Then Disappear Beyonce Buys Out Ivy Park Co-Owner After Chairman Accused of Sexual and Racial Harassment  In his acceptance speech, Kaepernick said that his “platform is the people.”  “I say this as a person who receives credit for using my platform to protest systemic oppression, racialized injustice and the dire consequences of anti-blackness in America,” he said. “I accept this award not for myself, but on behalf of the people. Because if it were not for my love of the people, I would not have protested. And if it was not for the support from the people, I would not be on this stage today. With or without the NFL’s platform, I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people.”  Kaepernick has been unable to find a new NFL position since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season, and sued the NFL and its owners in October for collusion against hiring him.

       " 'How to perform a Satanic Destruction Ritual  Photo by Levan TK (LA Weekly).  I’ve come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society. It’s something everyone does (whether they like to admit it or not), we’re told to be ashamed of their practice, but they both make us feel good. Rituals are a very personal thing, and seldom understood writ large. If you’re out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day, odds are you’ll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning.  What are rituals?  The truth is, that all of human life is made of rituals.  Mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements, animal sacrifice, and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the American imagination. However, rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure. It’s time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is, and recognize the potential (dare I say) benefits of doing such things — specifically here the Destruction Ritual.  Rituals have a strange role in my life. Coming from an academic background in anthropology, the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind. The formal definition in that field is:  “Rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose, such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, and may reinforce broader community social bonds, as in a wedding. They are used to reinforce social bonds and structure.”  Traditional Oriya Wedding Ceremony in India is a right-of-passage ritual practiced by those of the Hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people.  Communion is a Christian ritual in which bread and wine are consumed to symbolically represent the body and blood of Christ being consummated and taken into his worshippers.  New Year’s Eve ritual practiced by Americans in New York every year on January 31st at Midnight in which a giant ball is “dropped” from the top of Time Square and confetti is released to celebrate the arrival of another year.  I’m also a chapter head for The Satanic Temple, so writing and performing rituals has become a foundational and therapeutic practice for me. For the last few years, I’ve found myself straddling a line between scientific objectivism and emotional catharsis with the subject.  Rituals are repeated human actions to fulfill, reinforce and maintain a part of the human function and experience. Brushing our teeth is a ritual created to tend to our dental health. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are daily rituals to tend to our caloric intake. Prayer before bed, meals or at church every Sunday is a ritual to tend to piety and relationship with God. Going to the gym is a ritual to tend to maintenance of our muscular and cardiovascular systems. But why don’t gym bags, toothbrushes and Eggo waffles send people running for the hills?  The media-driven Manson case heavily polluted the concept of rituals in America.  The media has heavily slandered the practice of rituals. The taboo has gone so far in the U.S. as to compelling hundreds of police departments nationally to create specific manuals for identifying Satanic rituals and effectively “busting” anyone caught doing them. This has had devastating side effects on our society (see The Satanic Panic of the 1980s & 1990s). Countless people who simply didn’t fit the mold of their community have been falsely accused of and imprisoned for horrible crimes ranging from rape to murder.  What is The Satanic Temple?  The Satanic Temple is a religious and activist organization that was birthed from the idea that we are at a point in history where combating the status quo is an essential component of progression as individuals and as a society. In our view, Satan is a mascot for combating bigotry and detrimental authority. We see God and Satan as literary figures that have become so deeply engrained in our culture that much of our public policy and legislation is based upon their story.  In the infamous revolt of the angels, Satan (let’s refer to him as Lucifer the Angel, as he is called in the New Testament) was, of the angels created by God, said to be the most perfect, powerful, and intelligent. God essentially created these angels to be hit men — immediately sending them off on quests to murder people who challenged him. Lucifer identified this problem, rallied some of the other angels, and confronted God to challenge his authority. Most any Christian you talk to will see this as Lucifer being arrogant, but we see it as bravery. As a result of Lucifer’s revolt, he was cast out of heaven by God, where he then fell to Earth and bestowed the gift of knowledge to human kind (specifically to Eve in the Garden of Eden in Genesis). We see ourselves as aligning with a literary figure that is heavily misinterpreted, and undertaking the same mission. Since we don’t believe in the supernatural, the concept of a nontheistic but Satanic ritual seems like an oxymoron.  What is the Destruction Ritual?  I’ll preface by saying, it’s not for invoking Satan, but rather combating harmful power over us just as Lucifer the angel did in the Bible. The Destruction Ritual was born from a tradition I have done for many years with friends and loved ones on New Year’s Eve. We would gather around a fire with some scraps of paper, pens, and a few bottles of liquor. We would take turns writing things down on the pieces of paper, reading them aloud, throwing them into the fire and then taking a shot. It would start out with us drawing dicks or writing silly stuff, but as the night progressed and the bottles emptied, we found ourselves sobbing, hugging, and getting some really sticky shit off our chests.  Then one year, we started bringing physical objects to destroy. Things that bore some kind of sentimental value we hung onto, but in reality just sat in a box in a closet somewhere and caused us negative emotions when we remembered they were there. We felt by hanging onto these objects, we were holding onto the hope of a failed relationship or the improvement of someone’s character, or a good memory we would cling to like this object was a life raft, but all it did was hurt us. My friend had a box of these creepy ceramic dogs her abusive grandfather gave her every year for her birthday. Another friend had an engagement ring from his ex fiancée that cheated in him. I had an antique children’s tambourine my ex gave me that I couldn’t let go of for some reason, as well as a bunch of photos and letters. We took turns smashing our objects with hammers, knives, and throwing the pieces into the fire. Afterwards, I felt a sense of empowerment I had never felt before, and an epiphany. The relationship was done, but I had let it still continue to hurt me by giving power to this stupid little plastic tambourine and a box of paper. By hanging onto them, I allowed the toxicity to seep into my everyday and gave something inanimate delusional purpose. We all cried, hugged, and stood around the fire silently watching the shards of our bad memories burn in the fire.  The Destruction Ritual serves this very purpose — destroying objects that we have given the power to hurt us. It’s a form of self love, as you are trusting that by destroying these stupid things, you will be stronger and lighter, so to speak, after doing it. So much of our culture revolves around material possessions. Our social status is assigned by what we have, our self worth is measured by what we have. We go into debt to buy cars and clothes and technology that pollutes the environment and will probably break and need to be replaced within two years anyway. In a way, you could stretch it and say the Destruction Ritual is your own petty way of combating the detrimental effects of capitalism. Whatever floats your boat.  Destruction Ritual performed by The Satanic Temple in Los Angeles during the Satanic Mass of 2017.  We performed this ritual (which also involves an incantation) at our Satanic Mass in January of 2017. Wedding rings, old medication bottles, gifts from exes and a diary were among the things destroyed. As I was reciting it, I looked at the audience and saw a lot of crying faces. Our Arizona chapter also performed it over the summer and it yielded a similar effect. This thing sounds goofy, but trust me, it feels really, really good.  So gather some loved ones, or just grab a hammer and ride solo. Here is the how to for the Destruction Ritual.  How to perform the Destruction Ritual:  Step One — Gather your object(s):  Preference is given to something you’re holding onto that has a negative association to a person or memory or action. Maybe it’s something you hide so it’s not in sight everyday to cause you grief, but it’s there and you can’t let go of it. It could be a possession or gift from someone abusive or cruel, a piece of clothing from “the old you”, bank statements or receipts from a time you made a poor financial decision, a token of some kind of failure (relationship, friendship, or a personal failure). If something doesn’t immediately come to mind, you can improvise. Write angry things you want to get off your chest onto a piece of paper and put it in a glass bottle.  Step Two — Find a good place to do it:  Ideally somewhere outdoors, where it’s safe to get dirty and have sharp pieces of your freshly destroyed bad memories around. It’s best to place plastic or something underneath so cleanup is easy and damage to surrounding area is minimized. Objects can also be placed on a platter of some kind. Fireplace, bonfire or fire pit is a bonus.  Step Three — Choose your weapon:  Depending on the object(s) you are destroying, choose your weapon of destruction. Hammers, daggers, baseball bats, crowbars, mallets, and knives work well. It’s really up to you and the space available to you. Don’t forget safety — if you are destroying something shatterable like glass or ceramics, wear safety glasses and gloves.  Step Four — Set the mood:  Light some candles, pick some music (we recommend Author & Punisher as an official TST Destruction Ritual selection), and lay your object(s) and weapon(s) of choice out.  Step Five — Recite the incantation:  * The “Ave Satanas” are totally optional and up to you, the reciter. But they’re fun to yell.  These were things that I held in my hands  These were things that belonged to me  These were things that I held in my heart  These were things that have meaning to me  These things are not dead, because they never carried life  But I gave these things life, because they have carried me  I gave these things my memories  My fear  My secrets  My tears  My blood  My devotion  My hate  My forgiveness  My pain  My pleasure  My love  My disdain  I am the creator of life in these things  For without me, they would not be  And people would seek to profit off what I give  With no mutual heart given back to me  We emancipate ourselves from this material slavery  For without my heart, these things would not be  (Ave Satanas)  We liberate ourselves from this endless cycle  Of voids filled with unnecessary greed  I fill my voids with love and compassion  I fill my voids with clarity  I fill my void with the beauty that surrounds me  I fill my voids with only that which propels me  (Ave Satanas)  Together we raise our arms and unshackle ourselves from the control these things have over us  Together we raise our hammers and daggers, and with them pierce the heart of that control  A power driven by addiction, attachment, consumption, and by a relentless hunger for excess  (Ave Satanas)  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  I DO NOT BELONG TO THESE THINGS  THESE THINGS BELONG TO ME  Step Six — Destroy your object(s):  Self-explanatory. Discard the pieces afterwards, there’s no point in holding on. Have at it, and be well. Ave Satanas, Hail Satan.',\n",

       " \"A member of Bachelor Nation has passed away.  Michael Nance — who competed on Emily Maynard‘s season 8 of The Bachelorette — has died, PEOPLE has confirmed.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  A representative for the Austin Police Department tells PEOPLE the precinct received a 911 call shortly after 2 p.m. on Monday and arrived at the scene to find Nance, 31, unresponsive. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  No cause or manner of death has been determined yet, though Nance’s death does not appear to be a result of foul play. An autopsy is being performed Tuesday, with toxicology results expected to take weeks.  Nance appeared on the ABC reality series when he was 26 and revealed in his Bachelorette introduction package that he had previously struggled with prescription painkillers abuse.  “Right now, life is good, but I haven’t put as much focus on my love life because the way I was a couple years ago, no one would have wanted to be around me,” he said. “I was addicted to prescription pain medicine. It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time.”  “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living,” he continued. “But my life is really, really good today. … I’m happy and I’m content, but there are things missing in my life. I would like to fund my soulmate.”  Following his appearance on The Bachelorette, the musician and Austin native starred in a music video for his song “The Heezy.”  After learning about Nance’s passing, several members of Bachelor Nation took to Twitter to express their condolences, including Maynard.  “So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent. Sending prayers and love to his family and friends,” she tweeted.  So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent.

An HBO source confirmed that during filming the duo were 'inseparable on the set.'  'The two of them were always joking around and having fun together.'  However over time this friendship has eroded. Once the show went to air in February, the pair’s relationship started to become competitive.  A source told LIFE & STYLE that things turned from that point onwards.  'The success of Big Little Lies has gone to both of their heads and there’s now a power struggle between the two stars,' the source revealed.

       " 'Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.',\n",

       " \"The Crown season two explores the relationship between Prince Philip and his son Charles as he is sent away to school – but what's the history behind the drama?  Prince Charles is at the heart of the second season of The Crown on Netflix as the heir to the throne grows up. Find out more about the history of Prince Charles and his time at school, along with who plays him in the Netflix drama, below.  Advertisement  Who plays young Prince Charles in The Crown?  In The Crown’s second season, young Prince Charles and Princess Anne are actually played by two different sets of child actors. The roles are re-cast halfway through as the children age.  The first Prince Charles we meet in season two is played by Billy Jenkins. He also starred in season one and has also appeared in the TV series Humans.  The second Prince Charles is played by Julian Baring, who takes over the role to deliver an emotional performance in episode nine as we take a deep dive into Philip and Charles’ father-son relationship.  Find out more about the history behind that episode below – contains minor spoilers.  Did Prince Philip force Charles to go to Gordonstoun?  Yes, and it didn’t go very well.  Charles had an unusual – and unhappy – education. In his early years the prince thrived as he was educated at home by his governess Catherine Peebles (“Mipsy”), who later described him as dreamy and thoughtful. However, at the age of eight it was announced that the Prince would attend school: he was sent first to Hill House School in London and then transferred to Cheam School, the oldest private school in the country.  Cheam was not a big success, as he struggled to fit in and make friends. Reportedly a sensitive child, Charles was deeply homesick and attached to his teddy bear. However, his headmaster Peter Beck later told Radio Times: “Educationally he was a very hard-working and able boy, very lucid in spoken and written work. Some of his written work was very good indeed.”  As the prince came towards the end of his years at Cheam, the Queen and her husband had to decide where to send him next. Philip was keen for his son to follow in his footsteps and attend the school where he had spent his formative years: Gordonstoun, a remote school in north-east Scotland.  Not everyone was keen. Charles was very close to his maternal grandmother, the Queen Mother, who appreciated his sensitive nature and encouraged his interest in music, art and culture. The Queen Mother wrote to Elizabeth urging her to intervene and keep him closer to home.  Arguing that he would be “terribly cut off and lonely in the far north,” she wrote in a letter on 23rd May 1961: “I suppose he will be taking his entrance exam for Eton soon. I do hope he passes because it might be the ideal school for one of his character and temperament.”  But the Duke of Edinburgh won the debate, arguing that Eton was too close to Windsor and London and the boy would have more privacy from the press in Gordonstoun. He had taken responsibility for family decisions, while his wife concerned herself with affairs of state – and the Queen let him make the decision. So Philip, a qualified pilot, ceremoniously flew his son to an RAF base in Scotland and then drove the rest of the way.  Was Prince Charles miserable at Gordonstoun school?  Gordonstoun was completely wrong for Charles. Where the athletic and confident Philip had thrived, Charles was absolutely miserable. He later referred to his years at Gordonstoun as “a prison sentence”, calling the school “Colditz in kilts”.  Each day started with a run (whatever the weather) and then a cold shower. The kids slept in dormitories on hard bunks, with the windows open all year around, and older kids were free to enforce discipline on the younger students.  According to his fellow school friends, Charles was relentlessly bullied. His contemporary Ross Benson reported: “He was crushingly lonely for most of his time there. The wonder is that he survived with his sanity intact.”  With a Prince at the school, the rules became stricter (no drinking, no smoking, less freedom), and the boys took that out on poor Charles. Anyone who tried to be his friend or even talk to him was teased with slurping sounds for sucking up to him. On the rugby field he was a prime target.  Charles wrote in a letter home in 1963: “The people in my dormitory are foul. Goodness, they are horrid. I don’t know how anybody could be so foul.” In another, he told his mother: “I hardly get any sleep in the House because I snore and I get hit on the head all the time. It’s absolute hell.” In response, the Duke of Edinburgh sent his son stern letters urging him to be stronger and more resourceful.  As we see in The Crown, the young prince was guarded by the detective Donald Green, who did his best to be unobtrusive. Green became a friend and father figure, until he was sacked for letting 14-year-old Charles order a cherry brandy on a school trip – in the presence of a tabloid reporter. Charles was devastated to lose his one ally.  Still, Charles stayed on at Gordonstoun, eventually becoming Head Boy and earning two A-levels: History (grade B) and French (grade C).  The Queen and her husband also sent Prince Andrew and Prince Edward to Gordonstoun.  What was Prince Philip’s relationship like with his son Charles?  The penultimate episode of The Crown is enough to have even the most ardent republican weeping as we see the gulf of understanding between father and son. Prince Philip, failing to respect the ways his son is different from him and love him for the boy he is; and Prince Charles, unable to live up to his father’s expectations and constantly unable to please him.  Prince Charles later spoke openly about his difficult relationship with his father, most notably to Jonathan Dimbleby for an authorised biography in the early 1990s during the wreckage of his separation from Diana.  He spoke of a father who was a tough disciplinarian with a forceful personality, whose harsh words had forced him to retreat into himself. Friends who were authorised to speak to Dimbleby for the book described Prince Philip “belittling” and “bullying” his son.  In his younger years, Charles idolised his father and sought to please him, taking up his sports like polo and even (some observed) starting to walk like him, with one arm behind his back.  Later there was more anger, and as biographer Sally Bedell Smith notes, he has continued to complain about his years at Gordonstoun well into his sixties.

And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart – OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw — Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the “Twilight’s” Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for “Snow White and the Huntsman,” who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson’s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said “there’s trouble in paradise,” with regards to Stewart and Maxwell’s relationship.  In April, the Twilight stars were reported to have “gotten together a few times over the past several weeks,” according to OK!  “They’re trying to keep it low-key, but there’s still chemistry there,” a source told OK! “People in their circles are starting to wonder if they’re considering a reconciliation.”  Supposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is “serious” about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!

Gamenguide reported earlier that the Remember Me star is currently suffering from depression and that’s why he has canceled his wedding with Twigs. Now the publication has reported about their pregnancy.  According to Gamenguide, there are reports that Robert Pattinson and Tahliah Debrett Barnett are planning to have a baby so they could save their failing relationship. According to the reports, the couple is now very desperate to fix their relationship and that’s why they have decided to have a baby  If these speculations about Kristen’s ex-boyfriend were not enough, other sources previously claimed that the engaged couple might be headed for an end. Hollywood Life reported that Twigs and Pattinson were spotted fighting at Los Angeles Airport. The publication further noted that the couple seemed visibly upset with each other.  At the same time, iTechPost explained that the fall between the couple is because of Kristen Stewart. Patrick Wachsberger, a Lionsgate chairman, recently confirmed the possibility of a Twilight sequel, and recent rumors suggest that the actor is seriously considering to share the screen with his ex-girlfriend again.  So, there are chances that Pattinson’s decision to feature in Twilight’s reboot with Stewart has caused the rife between him and Twigs.  Meanwhile, Twigs was not sporting her engagement ring during their recent trip and many are believing that they have officially parted their ways. InTouch also reported that the couple’s friends think that things are not going too well between them as she is very dominating.  “[She] isn’t the girl for him.

A photo posted by FKA twigs (@fkatwigs) on Aug 14, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT  Robert was recently under media radar when there were rumors that the reason why he is not marrying Tahliah is because he is gay. A hoax website claimed that Little Ashes star has come out as gay. The website, which apparently later deleted the post, falsely claimed that he cannot accept the fact that Kristen is thinking to settle down with Alicia Cargile.  “I completely fell for this guy and at first I thought I was confused with my emotions and I did not want to let my female fans down. But after careful consideration, I felt it was best to come out to the public and confirm that I am gay,” the website claimed that the actor told to an imaginary news station.  Apart from this fabricated news, the publication went on to claim that Gay Times magazine has offered him “a multi-million dollar modeling contract.”  Personal Shopper actress, Kristen Stewart, came out as a lesbian in July when she officially talked about her ongoing relationship with Cargile. During her recent interview, she talked about her sexuality and her approach towards dating.  “When I was dating a guy I was hiding everything that I did because everything personal felt like it was immediately trivialized, so I didn’t like it,” she further said. “We were turned into these characters and placed into this ridiculous comic book, and I was like, ‘That’s mine. You’re making my relationship something that it’s not.’ I didn’t like that. But then it changed when I started dating a girl. I was like, ‘Actually, to hide this provides the implication that I’m not down with it or I’m ashamed of it, so I had to alter how I approached being in public. It opened my life up and I’m so much happier.'”  So, according to the hoax site, if Kristen can realize about her sexual preferences then Robert can also come out as a gay.  Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs’ representatives have not commented on the recent reports about the pregnancy or about their split, so fans should consider the pregnancy reports as only speculations.

Ripa agreed, but during her appearance on the nightly show, she had host Jimmy Fallon blow the image up and show it to his millions of viewers. “Why did I have these kids if not to exploit them on social media?” she joked to Fallon. Moms.  In a photo Ripa shared last week, the caption read, “Wishing you a LIT holiday season! With love from the Consuelos gang.” Ripa even added “(and yes, Lola approved)” to the end to stave off any questioning. Phew! As many parents know, when the kids are happy, everyone’s happy.',\n",

       " \"Remarks by the President on a New Strategy for Afghanistan and PakistanTHE WHITE HOUSEOffice of the Press Secretary_______________________________________________________________For Immediate Release March 27, 2009REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENTON A NEW STRATEGY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTANRoom 450Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building9:40 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Please be seated.Before I begin today, let me acknowledge, first of all, Your Excellencies, all the ambassadors who are in attendance. I also want to acknowledge both the civilians and our military personnel that are about to be deployed to the region. And I am very grateful to all of you for your extraordinary work.I want to acknowledge General David Petraeus, who's here, and has been doing an outstanding job at CENTCOM, and we appreciate him. I want to thank Bruce Reidel -- Bruce is down at the end here -- who has worked extensively on our strategic review. I want to acknowledge Karl Eikenberry, who's here, and is our Ambassador-designate to Afghanistan. And to my national security team, thanks for their outstanding work.Today, I'm announcing a comprehensive, new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. And this marks the conclusion of a careful policy review, led by Bruce, that I ordered as soon as I took office. My administration has heard from our military commanders, as well as our diplomats. We've consulted with the Afghan and Pakistani governments, with our partners and our NATO allies, and with other donors and international organizations. We've also worked closely with members of Congress here at home. And now I’d like to speak clearly and candidly to the American people.The situation is increasingly perilous. It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.Many people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: What is our purpose in Afghanistan? After so many years, they ask, why do our men and women still fight and die there? And they deserve a straightforward answer.So let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan. In the nearly eight years since 9/11, al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. This almost certainly includes al Qaeda's leadership: Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.But this is not simply an American problem -- far from it. It is, instead, an international security challenge of the highest order. Terrorist attacks in London and Bali were tied to al Qaeda and its allies in Pakistan, as were attacks in North Africa and the Middle East, in Islamabad and in Kabul. If there is a major attack on an Asian, European, or African city, it, too, is likely to have ties to al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan. The safety of people around the world is at stake.For the Afghan people, a return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy, and the denial of basic human rights to the Afghan people -- especially women and girls. The return in force of al Qaeda terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence.As President, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people. We are not in Afghanistan to control that country or to dictate its future. We are in Afghanistan to confront a common enemy that threatens the United States, our friends and our allies, and the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan who have suffered the most at the hands of violent extremists.So I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That's the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: We will defeat you.To achieve our goals, we need a stronger, smarter and comprehensive strategy. To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq. To enhance the military, governance and economic capacity of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we have to marshal international support. And to defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, we must recognize the fundamental connection between the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan -- which is why I've appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who is here, to serve as Special Representative for both countries, and to work closely with General Petraeus to integrate our civilian and military efforts.Let me start by addressing the way forward in Pakistan.The United States has great respect for the Pakistani people. They have a rich history and have struggled against long odds to sustain their democracy. The people of Pakistan want the same things that we want: an end to terror, access to basic services, the opportunity to live their dreams, and the security that can only come with the rule of law. The single greatest threat to that future comes from al Qaeda and their extremist allies, and that is why we must stand together.The terrorists within Pakistan's borders are not simply enemies of America or Afghanistan -- they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of Pakistan. Al Qaeda and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They've killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated Benazir Bhutto. They've blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment, and threatened the stability of the state. So make no mistake: al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.It's important for the American people to understand that Pakistan needs our help in going after al Qaeda. This is no simple task. The tribal regions are vast, they are rugged, and they are often ungoverned. And that's why we must focus our military assistance on the tools, training and support that Pakistan needs to root out the terrorists. And after years of mixed results, we will not, and cannot, provide a blank check.Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaeda and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken -- one way or another -- when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.The government's ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security. To help Pakistan weather the economic crisis, we must continue to work with the IMF, the World Bank and other international partners. To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan. To avoid the mistakes of the past, we must make clear that our relationship with Pakistan is grounded in support for Pakistan's democratic institutions and the Pakistani people. And to demonstrate through deeds as well as words a commitment that is enduring, we must stand for lasting opportunity.A campaign against extremism will not succeed with bullets or bombs alone. Al Qaeda's offers the people of Pakistan nothing but destruction. We stand for something different. So today, I am calling upon Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by John Kerry and Richard Lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools and roads and hospitals, and strengthen Pakistan's democracy. I'm also calling on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Maria Cantwell, Chris Van Hollen and Peter Hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence. And we will ask our friends and allies to do their part -- including at the donors conference in Tokyo next month.I don't ask for this support lightly. These are challenging times. Resources are stretched. But the American people must understand that this is a down payment on our own future -- because the security of America and Pakistan is shared. Pakistan's government must be a stronger partner in destroying these safe havens, and we must isolate al Qaeda from the Pakistani people. And these steps in Pakistan are also indispensable to our efforts in Afghanistan, which will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border.Security demands a new sense of shared responsibility. And that's why we will launch a standing, trilateral dialogue among the United States, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our nations will meet regularly, with Secretaries Clinton and Secretary Gates leading our effort. Together, we must enhance intelligence sharing and military cooperation along the border, while addressing issues of common concern like trade, energy, and economic development.This is just one part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent Afghanistan from becoming the al Qaeda safe haven that it was before 9/11. To succeed, we and our friends and allies must reverse the Taliban's gains, and promote a more capable and accountable Afghan government.Our troops have fought bravely against a ruthless enemy. Our civilians have made great sacrifices. Our allies have borne a heavy burden. Afghans have suffered and sacrificed for their future. But for six years, Afghanistan has been denied the resources that it demands because of the war in Iraq. Now, we must make a commitment that can accomplish our goals.I've already ordered the deployment of 17,000 troops that had been requested by General McKiernan for many months. These soldiers and Marines will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border. This push will also help provide security in advance of the important presidential elections in Afghanistan in August.At the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of Afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country. That's how we will prepare Afghans to take responsibility for their security, and how we will ultimately be able to bring our own troops home.For three years, our commanders have been clear about the resources they need for training. And those resources have been denied because of the war in Iraq. Now, that will change. The additional troops that we deployed have already increased our training capacity. And later this spring we will deploy approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces. For the first time, this will truly resource our effort to train and support the Afghan army and police. Every American unit in Afghanistan will be partnered with an Afghan unit, and we will seek additional trainers from our NATO allies to ensure that every Afghan unit has a coalition partner. We will accelerate our efforts to build an Afghan army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011 -- and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward.This push must be joined by a dramatic increase in our civilian effort. Afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people. The economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency. The people of Afghanistan seek the promise of a better future. Yet once again, we've seen the hope of a new day darkened by violence and uncertainty.So to advance security, opportunity and justice -- not just in Kabul, but from the bottom up in the provinces -- we need agricultural specialists and educators, engineers and lawyers. That's how we can help the Afghan government serve its people and develop an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs. And that's why I'm ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground. That's also why we must seek civilian support from our partners and allies, from the United Nations and international aid organizations -- an effort that Secretary Clinton will carry forward next week in The Hague.At a time of economic crisis, it's tempting to believe that we can shortchange this civilian effort. But make no mistake: Our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we don't invest in their future. And that's why my budget includes indispensable investments in our State Department and foreign assistance programs. These investments relieve the burden on our troops. They contribute directly to security. They make the American people safer. And they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run -- because it's far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop -- or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to Afghan responsibility.As we provide these resources, the days of unaccountable spending, no-bid contracts, and wasteful reconstruction must end. So my budget will increase funding for a strong Inspector General at both the State Department and USAID, and include robust funding for the special inspector generals for Afghan Reconstruction.And I want to be clear: We cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes Afghans to lose faith in their own leaders. Instead, we will seek a new compact with the Afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior, and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.In a country with extreme poverty that's been at war for decades, there will also be no peace without reconciliation among former enemies. Now, I have no illusion that this will be easy. In Iraq, we had success in reaching out to former adversaries to isolate and target al Qaeda in Iraq. We must pursue a similar process in Afghanistan, while understanding that it is a very different country.There is an uncompromising core of the Taliban. They must be met with force, and they must be defeated. But there are also those who've taken up arms because of coercion, or simply for a price. These Afghans must have the option to choose a different course. And that's why we will work with local leaders, the Afghan government, and international partners to have a reconciliation process in every province. As their ranks dwindle, an enemy that has nothing to offer the Afghan people but terror and repression must be further isolated. And we will continue to support the basic human rights of all Afghans -- including women and girls.Going forward, we will not blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable. We’ll consistently assess our efforts to train Afghan security forces and our progress in combating insurgents. We will measure the growth of Afghanistan’s economy, and its illicit narcotics production. And we will review whether we are using the right tools and tactics to make progress towards accomplishing our goals.None of the steps that I've outlined will be easy; none should be taken by America alone. The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or al Qaeda operates unchecked. We have a shared responsibility to act -- not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it. And what’s at stake at this time is not just our own security -- it's the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security. That was the founding cause of NATO six decades ago, and that must be our common purpose today.My administration is committed to strengthening international organizations and collective action, and that will be my message next week in Europe. As America does more, we will ask others to join us in doing their part. From our partners and NATO allies, we will seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the Afghan elections, training Afghan security forces, a greater civilian commitment to the Afghan people. For the United Nations, we seek greater progress for its mandate to coordinate international action and assistance, and to strengthen Afghan institutions.And finally, together with the United Nations, we will forge a new Contact Group for Afghanistan and Pakistan that brings together all who should have a stake in the security of the region -- our NATO allies and other partners, but also the Central Asian states, the Gulf nations and Iran; Russia, India and China. None of these nations benefit from a base for al Qaeda terrorists, and a region that descends into chaos. All have a stake in the promise of lasting peace and security and development.That is true, above all, for the coalition that has fought together in Afghanistan, side by side with Afghans. The sacrifices have been enormous. Nearly 700 Americans have lost their lives. Troops from over 20 countries have also paid the ultimate price. All Americans honor the service and cherish the friendship of those who have fought, and worked, and bled by our side. And all Americans are awed by the service of our own men and women in uniform, who've borne a burden as great as any other generation’s. They and their families embody the example of selfless sacrifice.I remind everybody, the United States of America did not choose to fight a war in Afghanistan. Nearly 3,000 of our people were killed on September 11, 2001, for doing nothing more than going about their daily lives. Al Qaeda and its allies have since killed thousands of people in many countries. Most of the blood on their hands is the blood of Muslims, who al Qaeda has killed and maimed in far greater number than any other people. That is the future that al Qaeda is offering to the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan -- a future without hope or opportunity; a future without justice or peace.So understand, the road ahead will be long and there will be difficult days ahead. But we will seek lasting partnerships with Afghanistan and Pakistan that promise a new day for their people. And we will use all elements of our national power to defeat al Qaeda, and to defend America, our allies, and all who seek a better future. Because the United States of America stands for peace and security, justice and opportunity. That is who we are, and that is what history calls on us to do once more.Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)END10:02 A.M. EDTNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\",\n",

The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines.  Letting a glimpse of her trademark flame hair shine through, the head piece perfectly framed her pretty face, accentuated by a touch of lipgloss and eyebrow pencil.  She teamed it with a black bomber jacket and black trousers as she stopped to check out the cosmetics.  The actress was seen posing with excited fans at the event, before making a quiet exit.

Modest: The American Mean Girls actress, 31, opted to wear a hijab for the event, conforming to the event's theme- which showcases the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines  London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, showcasing the latest styles in hijabs, abayas and long hemlines.  The second installment of the two-day event, held at Victoria House, Bloomsbury, saw models parading down the runway in demure clothing.  Running alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to £200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops - including a 'sharia legal hub'.  More than 40 designers from around the world showcased scarves, hijabs and loose-fitting maxi dresses at the annual style showcase organised by Haute Elan, who say 'modest fashion' is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets.  In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.'  A new angle: London Modest Fashion week kicked off this weekend, running alongside London Fashion week  The Arabic greeting translates to 'and unto you peace,' and many took it mean that Lohan was converting to the Muslim faith.  Lohan has not revealed however if she is in fact converting to the faith, and a rep for the actress did not respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com.  There were previously rumors that Lohan might be converting back in 2015 when she was photographed holding a copy of the Quran while doing community service in Brooklyn.  When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the book was actually just a gift from some friends.  'My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,' said Lohan.  Rare picture: In January Lindsay deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio, changing her bio to 'Alaikum salam.' (seen in her latest new Instagram post)  'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.'  She said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media.  'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan.  She said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country.  Lohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey.  She told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year.  'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan,  'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.'  She then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.'  Just a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'.  'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went.  'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain.  'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older.....  'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.  'Still and son on, i cannot help but want to fix all of these idle isis minds because, there has to be something i can figure out.  'Rather than living in a world of fear and doubt, they now shoot, we used to shout  'If only i can keep trying to fix it all, i would keep the world living loving and small. 'I would share my smiles and give too Many kisses.'\",\n",

The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur’s turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue.  “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.  Also Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday  Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk “should check his mail before tweeting.”  Musk originally called Unsworth — a diver that criticized Musk’s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a “PR stunt” — a “pedo guy” in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was “spoken in anger.”  Also Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All  “You published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,” Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. “You did so without any basis.”  Wood added that he’s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.  A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.  Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it’s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur.

Stepping out of her chaufeured SUV onto a sidewalk in freezing midtown Manhattan, Angelina Jolie accompanied four of her six kids to a National Geographic exhibit in Times Square on Dec. 14.  “Angelina started Christmas vacation early,” says an insider, explaining that the NYC visit was part of a holiday shopping trip. “The Pitt-Jolie family has always loved New York at Christmastime — the ice-skating rink in Central Park, the amazing store window displays along Fifth Avenue. And she’s planning more trips with the kids in late December and early January.”  Meanwhile, their dad, Brad Pitt, is doing everything he can to squeeze in some time with his brood, too. Last year, he got just a few hours with his younger kids on Dec. 25, and this year he’s hoping things will be different for the holiday season and beyond.  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  “He’s champing at the bit to get more custody [of Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9]. His Christmas wish is to have equal custody,” the insider exclusively tells In Touch. “But at this point, the divorce is still stonewalled, and Angie has been talking about taking the kids away to a foreign country for Christmas.”  It’s been 15 months since their shocking split, and “Angie and Brad are still playing tug-of-war with their kids,” a source tells In Touch. “Because they’re not officially divorced yet, Angie’s in the driver’s seat when it comes to getting the children for the holidays, and she’s taking full advantage of that.”  He misses them so much. “The holidays are Brad’s favorite time to be with the kids,” says the insider. “He’s out to try to get as many days as possible with the children over the Christmas week, having dinners and fun times at his LA home, which is not even a mile from where Angie and the kids are living.”  But Angelina, 42, continues to keep him at arm’s length. “She’s still bitter and angry,” says the source, noting that they were arguing constantly in the days leading up to Dec. 25 last year. Brad, 54, “is trying to play nice, but every time he asks Angie for something concerning the kids, she shoots him down. It’s contentious, to say the least.” He’s tried to move things forward legally as well. But, “She’s fought him every step of the way on the divorce he so desperately wants,” adds the insider.  Brad is desperate. “He’s doing whatever it takes, whether it be begging, pleading or cajoling Angelina to make it happen,” says the insider. “It’s not easy. But he feels if he’s earnest, caring and demonstrates how the children need their father, Angelina will allow him some quality time alone with the kids and maybe even entertain negotiations on the divorce.

       " 'Johnny Depp. Getty Many entertainment stars love the finer things in life, but it seems even the earnings of an A-lister like Johnny Depp couldn\\'t sustain his wild indulgences.  The \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star is currently in a public-relations tailspin after his messy divorce with actress Amber Heard, who alleged he had abused her, and his filing a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers at The Management Group. (TMG has countersued.)  Things didn\\'t get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp\\'s financial woes.  TMG\\'s Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn\\'t have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.  Depp\\'s extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.  TMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau — on which he spent $10 million to renovate — but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.  Johnny Depp will be seen next in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" out May 26. Disney Depp has routinely earned $20 million up-front paychecks for the movies he\\'s been in since the success of 2003\\'s \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He also gets 20% of the backend per picture, according to The Hollywood Reporter — a source said that was $40 million from the backend of each \"Pirates\" movie and $55 million from his profit on the 2010 hit \"Alice in Wonderland,\" which earned over $1 billion worldwide.  TMG attorney Michael Kump said in the lawsuit that TMG stepped in to help Depp avert a \"devastating financial collapse.\" Depp has claimed he was kept in the dark about his finances.  It\\'s unclear how cash-strapped Depp is. According to litigation, he has received $25.7 million over the past two years in profits from six movies, and he earned up-front money — likely close to $20 million each — from \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" \"LAbyrinth,\" and \"Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes.\"  A representative for Depp did not immediately respond to Business Insider\\'s request for comment.',\n",
       " 'Brad Pitt is not looking for a serious relationship The Hollywood actor prefers to spend time with his children  Court warns Angelina, asks her to allow Brad more access to kids 00:36  Hollywood star Brad Pitt is in better spirits as he is getting to spend more time with his children. The actor, 54, will soon be in London, where ex Angelina Jolie is currently filming \\'Maleficent 2 \\' to see his children for a second time in recent weeks. \\'The visit comes after a judge presiding over the former couple\\'s divorce proceedings established a detailed schedule for him to spend time with Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\"Having kids was always very special to him. He wanted kids for years before he met Angie. He was dreaming about being a dad. And he has always been a great dad. Very involved and present. He talks about the kids non-stop now. He brought gifts back to England,\" a source told .The court papers stated, \"The children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\" and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she does not allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.Their oldest son Maddox , 16, is not included in the timetable because, according to the court, he is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.\"Brad has been in the best mood. Although he was away from the kids for a week, it seems just the fact that he now knows when he will see them, makes him very happy. He couldn\\'t wait to get back to England. Not following a proper custody schedule was very difficult for him. And very sad as well,\" the source added.',\n",

The Marvelous Miss Maisel actress, 27, stepped out in a pink floral Dolce & Gabbana gown for the star-studded event at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. After posing for photos, she’d later introduce the performance of The Band’s Visit.  Spade died by suicide on June 5. She was found dead in her New York City apartment at about 10:20 a.m. by her housekeeper.

She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,” he said in a statement. “Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.”  He continued: “There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.”  The pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate’s death.  Like Brosnahan, Andy’s brother David Spade has returned to the public eye since the tragedy. On June 8, he said during a stand-up performance that it had been a “rough week” but he didn’t want to cancel the show.  68 PHOTOS Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals See Gallery Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 10: Todd Spiewak and Jim Parsons attend the 72nd Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 10, 2018 in New York City.

       " 'This article is about the American actress. For other people with the same name, see Julia Roberts (disambiguation) . For the American country music singer, see Julie Roberts . For the British jazz, rock and house music singer, see Juliet Roberts  Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress and producer. She became a Hollywood star after headlining the romantic comedy Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She has won three Golden Globe Awards (out of eight nominations) and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most successful actresses in terms of box office receipts.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend\\'s Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Ocean\\'s Eleven (2001), Ocean\\'s Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson\\'s War (2007), Valentine\\'s Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014).  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990\\'s Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2007 Roberts\\'s net worth was estimated to be $140 million.[7] She has been named the world\\'s most beautiful woman by People a record five times.  Early life and family [ edit ]  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][8] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][8][9] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[10][11] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic,[12] and she was raised Catholic.[13][14] Her older brother, Eric Roberts, from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, sister Lisa Roberts Gillan, and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors.  Roberts\\' parents, one-time actors and playwrights, met while performing in theatrical productions for the armed forces. They later co-founded the Atlanta Actors and Writers Workshop in Atlanta, off Juniper Street in Midtown. They ran a children\\'s acting school in Decatur, Georgia, while they were expecting Julia. The children of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King attended the school; Walter Roberts was their daughter Yolanda Denise King\\'s acting coach.[15] As a thank-you for his service, Mrs. King paid Mrs. Roberts\\'s hospital bill when Julia was born.[16]  Her parents married in 1955. Her mother filed for divorce in 1971; the divorce was finalized in early 1972.[17] From 1972, Roberts lived in Smyrna, Georgia, where she attended Fitzhugh Lee Elementary School, Griffin Middle School, and Campbell High School.[18] In 1972, her mother married Michael Motes, who was abusive and often unemployed; Roberts despised him.[19] The couple had a daughter, Nancy Motes, who died at 37 on February 9, 2014, of an apparent drug overdose.[20] The marriage ended in 1983, with Betty Lou divorcing Motes on cruelty grounds; she had stated that marrying him was the biggest mistake of her life.[19] Roberts\\'s own father died of cancer when she was ten.[21]  Roberts wanted to be a veterinarian as a child.[22] She also played the clarinet in her school band.[23][24] After graduating from Smyrna\\'s Campbell High School, she attended Georgia State University but did not graduate. She later headed to New York City to pursue a career in acting. Once there, she signed with the Click Modeling Agency and enrolled in acting classes.[25][26]  Acting career [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  Roberts made her first big screen appearance in the film Satisfaction (1988), alongside Liam Neeson and Justine Bateman, as a band member looking for a summer gig. She had previously performed a small role opposite her brother Eric, in Blood Red (she has two words of dialogue), filmed in 1987, although it was not released until 1989. Her first television appearance was as a juvenile rape victim in the initial season of the series Crime Story with Dennis Farina, in the episode titled \"The Survivor\", broadcast on February 13, 1987. Her first critical success with moviegoers was her performance in the independent film Mystic Pizza in 1988;[27] that same year, she had a role in the fourth-season finale of Miami Vice. In 1989, she was featured in Steel Magnolias, as a young bride with diabetes, and received both her first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actress) and first Golden Globe Award win (Motion Picture Best Supporting Actress) for her performance.[27]  1990s [ edit ]  Roberts became known to worldwide audiences when she starred with Richard Gere in the Cinderella/Pygmalionesque story, Pretty Woman, in 1990.[27] Roberts won the role after Michelle Pfeiffer, Molly Ringwald, Meg Ryan, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Karen Allen, and Daryl Hannah (her co-star in Steel Magnolias) turned it down.[28] The role also earned her a second Oscar nomination, this time as Best Actress, and second Golden Globe Award win, as Motion Picture Best Actress (Musical or Comedy).[27] Her next box office success was the thriller Sleeping with the Enemy, playing a battered wife who escapes her abusive husband, played by Patrick Bergin, and begins a new life in Iowa. She played Tinkerbell in Steven Spielberg\\'s Hook in 1991, and also played a nurse in the 1991 film, Dying Young. This work was followed by a two-year hiatus, during which she made no films other than a cameo appearance in Robert Altman\\'s The Player (1992). In early 1993, she was the subject of a People magazine cover story asking, \"What Happened to Julia Roberts?\"[29] She was offered the role of Annie Reed in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Denzel Washington in The Pelican Brief (1993), based on John Grisham\\'s 1992 novel of the same name.[27] In 1996, she appeared in season 2 of Friends (episode 13 \"The One After the Superbowl\").[31] She had a relationship with cast member Matthew Perry at the time.[32][33][34][35] According to an audience member, Roberts said to Perry about their on-screen kiss, \"I\\'m glad we rehearsed this over the weekend.\"[36] She was offered the role of Lucy Eleanor Moderatz in While You Were Sleeping (1995), but turned it down.[30]  Roberts co-starred with Liam Neeson in Michael Collins (1996).[27] That same year, she starred in Stephen Frears\\' Mary Reilly, which was a commercial failure. In 1997, however, she enjoyed renewed success with the romantic comedy My Best Friend\\'s Wedding. In 1998, she appeared on Sesame Street opposite the character Elmo, demonstrating her ability to change emotions. She was offered the role of Viola de Lesseps in Shakespeare in Love (1998) but turned it down.[30] She starred in the films Stepmom (1998), alongside Susan Sarandon,[37] Notting Hill (1999), with Hugh Grant, and, also in 1999, in Runaway Bride, her second film with Richard Gere. Roberts was a guest star on the Law & Order television series episode \"Empire\" with series regular Benjamin Bratt (at that time her boyfriend). She earned a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[38]  2000s [ edit ]  In 2000, she played the lead role of real-life environmental activist Erin Brockovich in the film Erin Brockovich.  In December 2000, Roberts, who had been the highest-paid actress through the 1990s, became the first actress to make The Hollywood Reporter\\'s list of the 50 most influential women in show business since the list had begun in 1992.[3]  In 2001, Roberts received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Erin Brockovich. Roberts\\' acceptance speech for the award went over the allowed time limit but did not mention the real-life Brockovich, for which Roberts later apologized, saying she forgot.[39] While presenting the Best Actor Award to Denzel Washington the following year, Roberts made a gaffe, saying she was glad that Tom Conti wasn\\'t there; she meant the conductor, Bill Conti, who had tried to hasten the conclusion of her Oscar speech the previous year, but instead named the Scottish actor.[40]  Roberts\\' first film following Erin Brockovich was the road gangster comedy, The Mexican, giving her a chance to work with long-time friend Brad Pitt. The film\\'s script was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to sign on. Though advertised as a typical romantic comedy star vehicle, the film does not focus solely on the Pitt/Roberts relationship and the two shared relatively little screen time together. The Mexican earned $66.8 million at the U.S. box office.[41] Later in 2001, she starred in the romantic comedy America\\'s Sweethearts along with Billy Crystal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Joe Roth, the Hollywood farce centers on a supercouple, Gwen and Eddie, who separate when she dumps him for another man. Roberts portrayed Gwen\\'s once-overweight sister and assistant who has been secretly in love with Eddie (Cusack) for years. Reviews of the film were generally unfavorable: critics\\' felt that despite its famous cast, the movie lacked \"sympathetic characters\" and was \"only funny in spurts.\"[42] A commercial success, it grossed over US$138 million worldwide, however.[43]  In fall 2001, Roberts teamed with Erin Brockovich director Steven Soderbergh for Ocean\\'s Eleven, a comedy-crime caper film and remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name, featuring an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. Roberts played Tess Ocean, the ex-wife of leader Danny Ocean (Clooney), originally played by Angie Dickinson, who is dating a casino owner played by Andy García. In preparation for her role, Roberts studied Dickinson\\'s performance by watching the original film at least seven times in order to get her part right.[44] A success with critics and at the box office alike, Ocean\\'s Eleven became the fifth highest-grossing film of the year with a total of US$450 million worldwide.[45]  In 2003, Roberts was cast in Mike Newell\\'s drama film Mona Lisa Smile, also starring Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Julia Stiles. Roberts received a record US$25 million for her portrayal of a forward-thinking art history professor at Wellesley College in 1953 – the highest ever earned by an actress until then.[46] The film garnered largely lukewarm reviews by critics, who found it \"predictable and safe\".[47]  In 2004, Roberts replaced Cate Blanchett in Mike Nichols\\'s Closer, a romantic drama film written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play of the same name.[48] The film also starred Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen.[48] Also in 2004, she reprised the role of Tess Ocean in the sequel Ocean\\'s Twelve. The film was deliberately much more unconventional than the first, epitomized by a sequence in which Roberts\\' character impersonates the real-life Julia Roberts, due to what the film\\'s characters believe is their strong resemblance.[49] Though less well reviewed than Eleven, the film became another major success at the box office, with a gross of US$363 million worldwide, mostly from its international run.[50] Unlike all the male cast members, Roberts did not appear in the series\\' third and final installment, Ocean\\'s Thirteen (2007), due to script issues.[51] In 2005, she was featured in the music video for the single \"Dreamgirl\" by the Dave Matthews Band; it was her first music video appearance.[52]  Roberts appeared in The Hollywood Reporter\\'s list of the 10 highest-paid actresses every year from 2002 (when the magazine began compiling its list) to 2005.[5]  Eat Pray Love, September 2010 Roberts in Paris promoting, September 2010  Roberts had two films released in 2006: The Ant Bully and Charlotte\\'s Web. Both films were animated features for which she provided voice acting.[53][54] Her next film was Charlie Wilson\\'s War (2007), with Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman, directed by Mike Nichols; it was released on December 21, 2007.[55] Fireflies in the Garden (2008), also starring Ryan Reynolds and Willem Dafoe, was released at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2008 and was subsequently shown in European cinemas; it did not get a North American release until 2011.[56]  Roberts made her Broadway debut on April 19, 2006, as Nan in a revival of Richard Greenberg\\'s 1997 play Three Days of Rain opposite Bradley Cooper and Paul Rudd. Although the play grossed nearly US$1 million in ticket sales during its first week[57] and was a commercial success throughout its limited run, her performance drew criticism. Ben Brantley of The New York Times described Roberts as being fraught with \"self-consciousness (especially in the first act) [and] only glancingly acquainted with the two characters she plays.\"[58] Brantley also criticized the overall production, writing that \"it\\'s almost impossible to discern its artistic virtues from this wooden and splintered interpretation, directed by Joe Mantello.\"[58] Writing in the New York Post, Clive Barnes declared, \"Hated the play. To be sadly honest, even hated her. At least I liked the rain—even if three days of it can seem an eternity.\"[59]  In 2009, Lancôme announced that Roberts would become their global ambassador for their company.[60]  2010s [ edit ]  Roberts at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival  Roberts starred with Clive Owen in the comedy-thriller Duplicity for which she received her seventh Golden Globe nomination. In 2010, she appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy Valentine\\'s Day, with Cooper, and starred in the film adaptation of Eat Pray Love. Eat Pray Love[61] had the highest debut at the box office for Roberts in a top-billed role since America\\'s Sweethearts.[62] Later in the year, she signed a five-year extension with Lancôme for GB£32 million.[63] In 2011, she co-starred as Mercedes Tainot in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne opposite Tom Hanks, who directed and played the title role.[64] The movie received generally bad reviews with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings,[65] although Roberts\\'s comedic performance was praised.[66] Roberts appeared in the 2012 Tarsem Singh adaptation of Snow White, titled Mirror Mirror, playing Queen Clementianna, Snow White\\'s evil stepmother.[67]  In 2013, Roberts appeared in August: Osage County, playing one of Meryl Streep\\'s character\\'s three daughters.[68] Her performance earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics\\' Choice Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, amongst other accolades.[69][70][71][72] It was her fourth Academy Award nomination.[73]  In 2014, Roberts narrated \"Women in Hollywood\", an episode of season 2 of Makers: Women Who Make America.[74] Roberts appears in Givenchy\\'s spring/summer 2015 campaign.[75][76] In 2016, she starred in the film Mother\\'s Day, the film received \"overwhelmingly negative reviews\" but was a moderate box office success grossing $48.5 million on a $25 million budget. The same year she also starred as television director Patty Fynn in the thriller Money Monster directed by Jodie Foster and also starring George Clooney and Jack O\\'Connell.[77][78][79]  In June 2017, Roberts announced she will be starring in a limited series for HBO, based on the Maria Semple novel, Today Will Be Different. This will be Roberts\\' first television series.[80]  Film production [ edit ]  Roberts runs the production company Red Om Films with her sister, Lisa Roberts Gillan, and Marisa Yeres Gill.[81] Through Red Om, Roberts served as an executive producer of the first four films of the American Girl film series (based on the American Girl line of dolls), released between 2004 and 2008.[82]  Personal life [ edit ]  Relationships and marriages [ edit ]  Roberts had romantic relationships with actors Jason Patric, Liam Neeson, Kiefer Sutherland, Dylan McDermott, and Matthew Perry.[83][84] She was briefly engaged to Sutherland; they broke up three days before their scheduled wedding on June 11, 1991.[85] On June 25, 1993, she married country singer Lyle Lovett; the wedding took place at St. James Lutheran Church in Marion, Indiana.[86] They separated in March 1995 and subsequently divorced.[87] From 1998 to 2001, Roberts dated actor Benjamin Bratt.[88]  Roberts and her husband, cameraman Daniel Moder, met on the set of her film The Mexican in 2000 while she was still dating Bratt. At the time, Moder was married to Vera Steimberg. He filed for divorce a little over a year later, and after it was finalized, he and Roberts wed on July 4, 2002,[89] at her ranch in Taos, New Mexico.[90] Together, they have three children: twins Hazel Patricia and Phinnaeus Walter Moder (born November 28, 2004)[91] and son, Henry Daniel Moder (born June 18, 2007).[92]  Religious beliefs [ edit ]  Deployed troops show Roberts the controls of an F-15  In 2010, Roberts disclosed, in an interview for Elle magazine that she believes in and practices Hinduism.[93] Roberts is a devotee of the guru Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaj-ji), a picture of whom drew Roberts to Hinduism.[94]  In September 2009, Swami Daram Dev of Ashram Hari Mandir in Pataudi, where Roberts was shooting Eat Pray Love, gave her children new names after Hindu gods: Laxmi for Hazel, Ganesh for Phinnaeus and Krishna Balram for Henry.[95]  Charities [ edit ]  Roberts has given her time and resources to UNICEF as well as to other charitable organizations. On May 10, 1995, Roberts arrived in Port-au-Prince, as she said, \"to educate myself\".[96][97] The poverty she found was overwhelming. \"My heart is just bursting\", she said.[96] UNICEF officials hoped that her six-day visit would trigger an outburst of giving: US$10 million in aid was sought at the time.[96][97]  In 2000, Roberts narrated Silent Angels, a documentary about Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder, which was shot in Los Angeles, Baltimore and New York. The documentary was designed to help raise public awareness about the disease. In July 2006, Earth Biofuels announced Roberts as a spokeswoman for the company and as chair of the company\\'s newly formed Advisory Board promoting the use of renewable fuels. She also supports Gucci\\'s \"Chime For Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.[98]  Roberts was the voice of Mother Nature in a 2014 short film for Conservation International, intended to raise awareness about climate change.[99]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Filmography [ edit ]  References [ edit ]',\n",

       " 'Remember when all the Kardashians and Jenners got on and life was much simpler?  Us too. But now the back-and-forth shade between the three Kardashian sisters, Kris Jenner and her ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner is at an all time high.  Through a timeline of shade, we look back at what\\'s been going on with America\\'s most famous reality show family.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  The family in 1995 Getty Images  June 2015: It all starts with the internet-breaking Vanity Fair interview - where she reveals her identity as Caitlyn to the world for the first time. Among the iconic pictures shot by Annie Leibowitz are comments about her relationship with Kris.  Vanity Fair  Firstly the two disagree on how much Caitlyn had told Kris about her gender identity issues, the fact she had taken female hormones in the 1980s and also dabbled with cross-dressing.  She also says the breakdown of their 23-year marriage was down to \"20 per cent gender and 80 per cent [was] the way I was treated\".  Kris tells the magazine Caitlyn was \"miserable\" and \"pissed off\" during the last years of their marriage.  August 2015: On Caitlyn\\'s new E! show, I Am Cait, Khloe is seen visiting Caitlyn where she takes issue with her comments about Kris.  Caitlyn tells Khloe sent her \"tough\" text messages, to which Khloe responds: \"I said we don\\'t care what you\\'re doing... we want to be there and support you but we don\\'t think that entails you speaking negatively about my mum. In our opinion you don\\'t even need to mention my mum. Let\\'s focus on the actual cause here and not drag my mum through the mud.\"  October 2015: Season 10 of Keeping up with the Kardashians shows Kris\\' reaction to the Vanity Fair interview and she is, shall we say, more explicit with her wording.  \"He can go f*** himself,\" she cries down the phone to a deadpan Kim. \"I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce.\"  Caitlyn and Kris Jenner at the 2015 Victoria’s Secret show Getty Images  Kim tells the camera: \"All Caitlyn can talk about is that my mum mistreated her and was awful and all these really rude things, when there\\'s no reason to bash my mum.\"  November 2015: Khloe appears on the Ellen Show saying she had a particularly hard time accepting Caitlyn\\'s transition because she found out on camera.    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  \"We kept asking him, \\'Bruce, like what\\'s going on? We\\'re hearing all these rumours?\\' and he kept telling us one thing but really he knew he was transitioning and wouldn\\'t be honest with us.  \"So really we felt like the last to know so that was hard for us, especially me.\"  January 2016: Khloe appears on the Howard Stern Show where she is very candid about a whole lot of things, including Caitlyn.  Saying she found out about Caitlyn\\'s transition at the same time that \"business people\" knew, despite repeatedly asking her whether the rumours about her transgender identity were true, she says she felt \"betrayed\".  \"We felt so like, \\'what the f***? We\\'ve been asking you and why do business people know?\\' I never want someone to feel like they have one-up on our family. We are a family. We\\'ve never turned our backs on each other yet with all the clusterf***s of s*** that\\'s happened in our lives, why would we now?  \"I don\\'t give a f*** what you want to do - just stop lying to us about things... Just lay it on the table, what are we doing? What\\'s happening? Even then he didn\\'t tell us... we didn\\'t know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn.\"  May 2016: It later turns out that Caitlyn was not ok with what Khloe said on Howard Stern, as was revealed on the season 12 premiere of KUWTK.  According to Khloe, she was inundated with angry messages from Caitlyn after the interview so naturally she vented to matriarch Kris:  \"I said, \\'You slaughtered my mother and you have the nerve to say, \\'What happened to family sticking together?\\' You jumped that ship as soon as you did Diane Sawyer and attacked my mum\\', and instead, [she] tells me to \\'get a life\\' and \\'shut up\\' and I\\'m like, \\'you shut up and you get a f***ing life.

I\\'m done.\"  Later in the episode, Kris is seen on the phone to Caitlyn trying to sort out the drama.  \"She\\'s out there talking s*** about me,\" Caitlyn vents to Kris about Khloe (bear with us). \"I don\\'t want her talking about me, ok? You don\\'t go on Howard Stern and call me a liar.\"  August 2016: Caitlyn spends Father\\'s Day with her youngest daughter Kylie watching basketball games. All seems well until she takes to Snapchat to joke about why Kylie is her favourite daughter.  Caitlyn and Kylie in November, 2015 Getty Images  \"Why, because it\\'s Father\\'s Day and she\\'s the only one that invited me over,\" she tells her followers.  According to Mail Online, Kim later said the rumours that all the siblings had abandoned Caitlyn on Father\\'s Day were not true and that she had actually invited her for brunch.  October 2016: Kris and Kim have an almighty row on KUWTK when Kris finds out that her daughter helped Caitlyn get ready for the ESPY awards in July, 2016.  When Kim tells her mother she wanted to stay neutral between the estranged couple, Kris yells: \"I want loyalty. I don\\'t want f***ing neutral. I\\'m trying to be as gracious as I can, I\\'m trying to be as understanding as I can. I\\'m betrayed. I\\'ve been f***ed over on so many levels that your head would spin.\"  April 2017: Things well and truly kick off when Caitlyn Jenner\\'s tell-all book The Secrets of My Life is released.  Here\\'s a very brief rundown of the biggest reveals in it:  Caitlyn says Kris had control over all the money the couple made from the show.  Apparently it was Caitlyn who came up with the idea of the show, not Kris. Ouch.  She says Kendall is the most down-to-earth of all the girls.  The Kardashians were not largely included in the Diane Sawyer documentary - which saw Caitlyn come out as transgender for the first time - because \"research shows that whenever a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money\". Eek.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  The Kardashians read the memoir and are not at all happy. In an episode of KUWTK Kris claims: \"Everything that she says is made up\" and claims the only nice thing Caitlyn had to say about her is that she\\'s great at parties.  \"I\\'ve never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life,\" Kris vented.  Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers to promote the book, the co-author Buzz Bissinger responds, saying: \"Kris is full of s***\".  Later in the month, Kim wades in telling The Ellen DeGeneres Show Caitlyn was not honest in the book about certain things to do with her mother.  \"It\\'s taken her a really long time to be honest with herself so I don\\'t expect her to be honest with my Mum now. It\\'s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world but not at our expense,\" she says.  Caitlyn also does another show with Diane Sawyer, where she says: \"Some [of my children] I have remained very close to. A couple of them... I\\'m a little more distant. I have to admit, I\\'ll sit here and wonder, \\'Is it because of my transitioning? Or is it because their life is so busy that they don\\'t call, like all the time?\\'... Nobody calls that much. I mostly reach out to them. Obviously the Jenner side call more, but they have their own lives.\"  May 2017: Kim appears on \\'Plead the Fifth\\' on Watch What Happens Live where Andy Cohen asks her the chances of Kris and Caitlyn ever speaking again.  \"Zero, one, no, two per cent and those are Kendall and Kylie. All fair, I think,\" she said casually.  On KUWTK later in the month, Kim tells Kourtney that, in her book, Caitlyn is \"so angry with mum for no reason\".  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Kourtney chimes in on Caitlyn\\'s claim that the Kardashians were excluded from the Diane Sawyer documentary because the name is associated with publicity stunts, adding: \"That sounds pathetic.\"  June 2017: For the first time, Caitlyn\\'s daughter Kendall also wades in on the book on KUWTK where she\\'s seen slamming the table in frustration.  \"I spoke to Kim about Dad\\'s book and heard about all the stuff she was saying in it and how a lot of it is so not true,\" Kendall tells her mum Kris. \"The weird part is I don\\'t think it\\'s purposeful lying, I think she really just thinks that\\'s what happened... and then she goes around dissing the Kardashians but those are the kids that you raised, if you have a problem with them you raised them.  \"It makes no sense to me that she would go around bashing them for no reason, that\\'s insane.\"  Kris calls the book a \"fabrication\" a few times, too.  Kim is also back again on the book, saying she has \"no respect\" for Caitlyn anymore.  Kendall, Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner in June, 2017 Getty Images  August 2017: In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kris rebukes the claim that it was Caitlyn who came up with the premise for the reality show that made the family the superstars they are today.  \"It\\'s so absurd,\" Kris says. \"I\\'m not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her it\\'s called Keeping up with the Kardashians.\"  Oooo. Burn.  September 2017: In the premiere of season 14 of KUWTK, Kim takes aim with another part of Caitlyn\\'s book which suggested that her dad - the late Robert Kardashian who defended his friend OJ Simpson in the infamous 1992 murder trial - at one point believed OJ to be guilty.  \"I have always had Caitlyn\\'s back,\" Kim says. \"She is a liar. She is not a good person.\"    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Caitlyn then tells Good Morning Britain that she and Kim have not spoken in nine months.  \"I love Kim so much, it\\'s such a huge loss in my life not having her there anymore,\" she tells Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. \"It\\'s really sad.\"  She adds that \"the Kardashians, particularly Kris, didn\\'t react that way [being proud of her book] even though I went overboard to be nice and friendly\".  October 2017: The Kardashian siblings continue airing their thoughts on Caitlyn\\'s book on KUWTK when Kim finds out about Caitlyn\\'s gender reassignment surgery through the media.  Khloe does not hold back with her comments - while on a private jet flying to Cleveland (as they do) - claiming that Caitlyn plays the victim.  \"I\\'m the victim, I\\'m the victim, they don\\'t want to see me. Oh f*** off and it\\'s not because you\\'re trans,\" Khloe vents. \"That\\'s not why I\\'m not talking to you. I\\'m not talking to you because you\\'re a bad, mean person.\"  Ooof.  November 2017: Caitlyn\\'s Jenner gives a talk at Cambridge University\\'s union, and says the Kardashians have hurt her badly.  \"It\\'s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,\" she says - which, in light of the above, is a bit of an understatement. She says she hasn\\'t spoken to Kim in over a year and other recent reports in the The Sun claim she hasn\\'t talked to Khloe in two years.  \"They don\\'t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly. It\\'s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt... In the book I express some opinions and got shot down. It was not about the Kardashians. They were only mentioned on 20 pages. They made it more about them on television. The book was about my life. That\\'s caused a lot of the separation between us.\"  December 2017: Caitlyn reveals on Piers Morgan\\'s Life Stories that she didn\\'t trust his ex-wife or step-children with news of her gender reassignment surgery, as she thought they\\'d leak it to the press.  \"They didn’t know that you had actually had the surgery?\", Morgan asked, when Jenner admitted to sending Kim a preview copy of her memoir The Secrets Of My Life, but removing the section about her surgery.  \"No I didn’t tell anybody. Why? It’s none of their business\", Jenner responded. \"It’s not that big a deal. Nobody knows. I had to be honest, the book is about honesty. It’s called The Secrets Of My Life. No it really wasn’t a big deal. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, ok, nobody knows anything. Because I didn’t want them to leak it to the press. There was no reason for them to know about it.  Asked if she didn’t trust the Kardashians, she replied: ‘Of course not – of course I didn’t trust them.’',\n",
       " 'Jada Pinkett Smith broke the news that, before a recent reconciliation, she and Gabrielle Union had been feuding for nearly two decades. Two decades. That’s the length of some actors’ entire careers, yet the public was none the wiser. The two actresses deserve some kind of award just for outwardly keeping the peace.  Pinkett Smith revealed the news to Extra while promoting her upcoming Facebook Watch talk show, which Union will eventually appear on. “I have a really touching episode with Gabrielle Union,” she told Extra. “We haven’t really been on the best of terms for 17 years, and we have a reconciliation. They were like, ‘We wanna do a girlfriends show,’ and I was like, ‘Well . . . .’ Her name just kept coming up. It just couldn’t be anything else. So we brought it to the table.”  17 is a very specific number, not rounded up or down. It’s a number a person can rattle off because they’ve kept the books up to date, and because something happened. That would mean that whatever went down did so in those halcyon days of 2001. This was post-Bring It On Gabrielle Union, and pre-The Matrix Reloaded Jada Pinkett Smith—around the time of Two Can Play That Game and Ali, respectively. What could have possibly happened?  They were never on a set together as far as IMDb is concerned, though Union starred alongside Pinkett Smith’s husband, Will Smith, in Bad Boys II, in 2003. The only picture that exists on the newswires where the actresses appear in the same frame is from February 2016, at the 47th NAACP Image Awards, and they have three women—Taraji P. Henson, Loretta Devine, and Tika Sumpter—between them. Was it a skirmish over the alarmingly few roles for black women in Hollywood? Or something more personal than professional? Pinkett Smith says neither of them can remember why it started. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Union for comment.)  The show airs Monday, May 7, and co-stars Pinkett Smith’s mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris and her daughter Willow Smith. I suppose we’ll all just have to watch for more clues.  Update (Monday, May 7 at 10:50 a.m.): Union stopped by the Today show on Monday and told host Hoda Kotb that indeed the “feud” is over.  “Jada nor I ever used the word feud, so it just became more of a media creation,” she said. “Kind of like back in the day, neither one of us actually knows what originally took place back then. But the people we had around us were like ‘well you know how she feels about you’ and they were like, ‘well you know how she feels about you.’ And then it was like ‘girl bye’ for 17 years. Even though we’re both very outspoken women, both activists, our husbands are friends, I worked with her husband, we both had too much pride and too much insecurities to just say, ‘Hey, did that ever actually happen or was that just a creation of someone who didn’t want to see two women rise together?’”',\n",
       " 'The Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 15, 2012. (Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company\\'s Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone\\'s working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon — even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that \"we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident.\" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney\\'s Office and that it was \"exploring all options with respect to those charges.\"Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

       " 'Kailyn Lowry said she’s spent the past six years working to graduate from college and complete her bachelor’s degree. And on Saturday, the 25-year-old Teen Mom 2 star finally did just that — walking the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree from Delaware State University.  The mother of two — who is currently pregnant with her third child — posted a sweet photo of herself and a friend to Instagram, both decked out in their graduation day best.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Guess what today is!” she wrote, adding a series of emojis (including the graduation cap) and the hashtag “#DSU.”  “We did it!” she added on Twitter — writing later, “there’s beauty in the struggle.”  On Sunday, Lowry took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons — and her baby bump!  “Between teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce… and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on,” she wrote of her struggle to get her degree.  “This has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,” she added. “There are a select few people around me that have helped make this possible for me, they know who they are and I’m so thankful for them. I love you!”  Jenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/  For the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.  In college graduation tradition, Lowry personalized her cap with fake, stick-on diamonds and gold sticker letters that read, “mom X3 + a degree.”  She presumably wore that cap on Saturday — though her Instagram post didn’t show it.

The MTV star revealed in a blog post in February that she is pregnant with her third child — confirming on May 2 that the baby’s father is her friend Chris Lopez.  Fans began to suspect that Lopez was the father after Lowry uploaded a photo of herself cradling her baby bump on April 26 with the caption: “Happy bump day from Baby Lo & me.”  I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl 😂🤰🏼🎀 — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) May 12, 2017  While the baby’s father has been confirmed, the sex of the baby appears to be even unknown for Lowry. She tweeted on Thursday, “I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.”  In February, Lowry admitted that she was trepidatious about the pregnancy initially.  “This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,” she wrote. “And like I say in my book — with a little bit of hustle and heart, I can and I will survive anything. Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can’t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.”',\n",

       " 'According to our source, who was at the taping for the show that will air on Thursday, Kardashian is very “hurt” by Jenner’s new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which alleges her mom Kris is lying when she says she didn’t knowing that Jenner wanted to transition for a number of years before their marriage fell apart. “My heart breaks for my mom, because she’s been through so much,” Kardashian said during the interview. “It’s unfair. Things aren’t truthful. I feel like it’s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now. It’s so hurtful.” As a result, she’s not talking to Jenner right now.  Kim Kardashian taped the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Wednesday, and Gossip Cop has exclusive details from her first talk show interview since being robbed in Paris. We’re told she talked about that harrowing experience, how she no longer speaks to Caitlyn Jenner, and what she’s doing for Kanye West’s upcoming 40th birthday. Check out the videos below!  The audience member also leaks that Kardashian spoke to DeGeneres at length about the Paris robbery, saying that it “changed” her life. “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me. I feel like it was so meant to happen. I’m such a different person,” she shared. Kardashian continued, “My whole life as changed as far as how I travel and security. I never thought that I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I’m traveling and I didn’t. Now, I have several, just for me to be able to sleep at night.” The reality star fully believed she was going to die, and now she no longer cares about possessions and materialistic items.  Kardashian also discussed life with her kids following the frightening ordeal in Paris, and said her 1-and-a-half year-old son Saint is her “10,” which the audience member understood to mean is a “perfect baby.” And, after DeGeneres asked about West and his well-being, Kardashian noted that the rapper’s 40th birthday is on June 8, and she’s still struggling with what she should do to mark his milestone. At that point, we’re told, the talk show host offered to host the entire Kardashian family for a one-hour birthday party. No word yet whether Kardashian will take DeGeneres up on the invitation.

       " 'Director’s departure over ‘creative differences’ expected to delay production, and could even lead to loss of star Daniel Craig  The immediate future of the James Bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director Danny Boyle.    Three months before shooting on the as-yet-untitled film was scheduled to start, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting quit, leaving producers scrambling.  A delay to the scheduled release date of 25 October 2019 looks inevitable; there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further, claiming star Daniel Craig as another victim.  A tweet from the franchise’s official account announced on Monday evening: “Michael G Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25.”  Industry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script, which Boyle wrote with his long-term collaborator John Hodge. The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle’s debut, Shallow Grave.  The Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015’s Spectre.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig in the most recent James Bond film, Spectre. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists  The producers were reportedly so keen to secure Boyle that they put an already completed screenplay, by the longtime 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, on the back-burner. Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.  Hodge and Boyle’s script – which is different in all respects – was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film.  A leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.  “You write in real time,” he said. “You acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world – but you also write in the modern world as well.”  Boyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema – “it’s a great idea so hopefully it will work” – which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time – or, potentially, die.  The high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.  Although Mendes and Craig’s tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (£232m), little compromise for the film’s commercial prospects can be countenanced.  Boyle and Hodge’s script is unlikely to survive the director’s exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade’s draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.  Producers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig’s second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years – between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) – and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.  This makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him.  Promoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role; months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes.  In 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.  Craig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.  Mark Tildesley, Boyle’s favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown.  Boyle’s latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 – just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle’s most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas.  Possible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie’s latest film, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office.',\n",

       " 'When I first walked into the Astros’ offices, which are located in the shell of Houston’s old Union Station abutting Minute Maid Park, on the morning of June 4, 2014, the club was still the laughingstock of baseball. Since the start of the 2011 season, the Astros had lost nearly twice as many games, 358, as they had won, 187. Worse, they were run by executives who were still viewed as know-it-all baseball outsiders—like the G.M., former management consultant Jeff Luhnow, and the so-called Director of Decision Sciences, the former NASA engineer Sig Mejdal—even though the men had at that point worked within the game for a decade. Worst of all, Luhnow and his execs were openly violating the baseball compact by which rebuilding teams were supposed to obscure their long-term plan by maintaining the illusion that they were genuinely trying to win each and every year, even if it meant losing just a little less.  “When you’re in 2017, you don’t really care that much about whether you lost 98 or 107 in 2012,” Luhnow said back then. “You care about how close we are to winning a championship in 2017.” In other words, they were entirely focused on several years down the line, which meant shedding every one of their expensive assets and starting from scratch. People hated it.  Still, a few days later I flew back to New York with the makings of a 5,000-word story that would appear in the June 24 issue Sports Illustrated, with a bold cover line: YOUR 2017 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS featuring the sorry Astros. SI’s editor Chris Stone and I, along with baseball editor Emma Span, had consulted on the proper year to choose. We settled on 2017 because the Astros’ young nucleus would by then be reaching its prime, because it seemed to more or less hew to the front office’s own timeline—which, they promised, would eventually include a payroll hike—and because three years, in baseball, is actually not the blink of an eye.  But many people, including some within our own office, hated the cover, too. Even the club’s own hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle, called it “more of an attention-grabbing, perhaps even tongue-in-cheek projection than a prediction.”  It was certainly a long shot, but so is everything in baseball. Vegas usually assigns a given season’s spring favorite less than a 20% chance of winning that fall’s World Series. What it wasn’t was empty clickbait, or a hot take. While we’re never above generating interesting conversations, my editors and I genuinely believed that what I saw down in Houston could result in a ring in three seasons. Now, the Astros are four games away from coming through on that prediction.  Of course, immediately after the issue reached mailboxes and newsstands, the Astros seemed to draw further away from the meeting the deadline we’d publicly set for them, in ways I described last month in an SI feature which focused on their recent last second trade for Justin Verlander. The 2015 Rookie of the Year, shortstop Carlos Correa, spent the second half of the season on the bench with a broken leg. George Springer, who had appeared on the cover, hit the DL. Their proprietary database, Ground Control, was revealed to have been hacked—by, it turned out, the former Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa, a former coworker of Luhnow’s and of several other Houston executives when they were all with St. Louis. (Correa—who, court documents suggested, was driven to increase his hacking efforts out of jealousy spurred by the SI cover, is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for unauthorized access of a protected computer.) Luhnow failed to sign the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, high school lefthander Brady Aiken, after the club detected an issue with Aiken’s elbow and decreased its offer to him. One of the Astros’ minor league stadiums flooded, and another caught on fire.  There were other mishaps and missteps along the way. “If we ever catch ourselves feeling smart, all we have to do is turn on SportsCenter,” Mejdal told me. There, as often as not, they could catch J.D. Martinez hitting another home run—the same J.D. Martinez whom Houston cut outright in March 2014, and who since then has an OPS (.936) higher than all but six other hitters in the majors. If Martinez wasn’t homering that night, then Kris Bryant probably was, the same Kris Bryant on whom the Astros passed with the top overall pick in 2013, in favor of the polished college pitcher Mark Appel. Appel had a 5.60 ERA in Triple-A this season—in the Phillies organization, where he was traded in December of 2015. Bryant, whom the Cubs picked No. 2 in `13, is the reigning NL MVP.  The Astros, though, never claimed to own a crystal ball, or that they would never make a mistake. They always expected to make many of them. Their goal was to make marginally more correct decisions than their competitors, in the long haul, and to do so they implemented an analytically rigorous system that not only processed all of the bleeding edge metrics they could find or create, but also heavily incorporated data from old fashioned sources: scouts, who could see things about a player’s potential and character that numbers couldn’t.  Many of those decisions have now paid off. Such as surprising baseball by drafting Correa—Carlos, not Chris—with the top pick in 2012, a move heavily endorsed by current assistant G.M. Mike Elias and one which not only gave them a star shortstop but also the financial room to choose starter Lance McCullers 41st overall. In McCullers’ most recent appearance, he shut out the Yankees over the final four innings of Game 7 of the ALCS. And declining to sign Aiken—who would indeed blow out his elbow nine months after the draft—and thus receiving a compensatory pick that they would use the next year on third baseman Alex Bregman, who has emerged as the star of the 2015 draft and was last seen making the pivotal and most risky defensive play of Game 7, nailing Greg Bird at home to keep the Yankees scoreless.  How about trading for Verlander, even though their metrics didn’t at all favor sacrificing three promising prospects for a 34-year-old with a contract guaranteeing him $28 million a year? It’s virtually impossible to imagine them making the World Series without the ALCS MVP. Or signing expensive free agents this past winter, like Carlos Beltran (one year, $16 million), Charlie Morton (two years, $14 million) and Josh Reddick (four years, $52 million)? Or hanging on to selected young players they’d inherited from the previous front office, particularly Springer, Jose Altuve and Dallas Keuchel?  Luck played its role, too—but the Astros’ plan, and the extended timeframe for their rebuilding effort permitted by owner Jim Crane, allowed room for good fortune. In the first season after Luhnow and his crew took over, 2012, Keuchel was a clean-shaven 24-year-old rookie who walked more batters (39) than he struck out (38), and Altuve was an undersized slap-hitter with nine career home runs. The front office had no idea that Keuchel would develop a devastating breaking ball and a more athletic delivery, as well as extraordinary facial hair, to become a Cy Young winner, or that Altuve, though still undersized, would develop into a power hitting, probable MVP. What they had was time to allow unexpected things like that to happen, as well as the analytical horsepower to expose players to every conceivable pathway by which they might improve.  Now they’re on the cusp of doing a few of the most unexpected thing of all: no, not making it seem as if we at Sports Illustrated know what we’re talking about—though, thanks for that—but winning the World Series just three years after completing their sixth straight losing season.  They’re still the underdog. Of eight SI baseball staffers who on Monday predicted the World Series’ outcome, just one picked the Astros to beat the Dodgers, and you can probably guess who that was without clicking that link. But even if they don’t do it this year, they are a team built to win in the long haul, as was always the plan. Just four members of the World Series roster—DH Carlos Beltran, outfielder Cameron Maybin and relievers Luke Gregerson and Francisco Liriano—will be free agents after the season, and none of them is nearly as vital as, say, Altuve, Correa, Keuchel, Springer or Verlander. And, with a payroll that still ranks around the league average of $150 million—an increase from a last-place $36 million just four years ago—they will have the wherewithal to spend more, too.  The most remarkable thing of all about the Astros is this: they told everyone exactly what they were going to do—and then they did it. That sort of confidence might not make them beloved within certain baseball circles. But whether they win or lose in the next nine days, it’s now impossible to doubt that they’ve been on to something all along.',\n",

       " 'Barack Obama has announced plans to become secretary general of the United Nations, allowing him to advance his globalist agenda on the world’s stage.According to Al-Jarida, Obama has no intention to step away from the spotlight, much to the dismay of other world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu:Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly is planning payback for President Obama’s dismissing Mr. Netanyahu’s objections to the Iran nuclear deal last year. Mr. Netanyahu is said to be rallying moderate Arabs to thwart Mr. Obama’s bid to become the Secretary-General of the United Nations after he leaves the White House next year.Mr. Obama has already discussed the issue with Republican, Democratic and Jewish officials in the United States, according to Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida.Mr. Netanyahu recently is said to have gotten wind of Obama’s plans which he calls the Obama Project. “Wasn’t eight years of having Obama in office enough?” Mr. Netanyahu is quoted in the Kuwaiti daily as telling associates. “Eight years during which he ignored Israel? And now he wants to be in a position that is liable to cause us hardships in the international arena.”Townhall.com reports: Further gripes Israel has with President Obama include the U.S. “moving closer to the Muslim Brotherhood, toppling the regime of Hosni Mubarak, and attempts to ally itself with political Islam,” the paper quotes a Netanyahu aide as saying.U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s term expires in early 2017, making Obama’s bid for the position a possibility.Last year after his speech at West Point, some pointed out that he sounded an awful lot like he was campaigning for the role.',\n",
       " 'Blake told the crowd during a performance in Oklahoma that Gwen had given birth to twins.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Charley Gallay / Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine’s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you! Blake.”',\n",
       " \"The player of the year race is as wide open as the sport has recently seen.  Want to go with experience, a freshman, a player from a non-power league? You won’t be wrong — now. There are no poor answers within reason.  But we put forth our own 16-player bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide. The winner? Tennessee’s Grant Williams, who beat Indiana’s Juwan Morgan in the final vote.  In his sophomore campaign last season, Williams averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.  Tennessee returns all five starters this season, and all six of its leading scorers, so Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to get Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.  Sixteen student-athletes qualified for our tournament of preseason player of the year candidates, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format. Voting was conducted on the @MarchMadness Twitter account and Instagram account beginning Monday, Oct. 15. The student-athlete with more fan votes in each matchup advanced to the next round.  Below are the results from each round of voting. Numbers at the end indicate vote percentage on Twitter:  Finals results:  (13) Grant Williams def.

(2) Zion Williamson, Fr., F, Duke: Williamson is a physical specimen that will dominate his position and be must-see every time out.

Barrett, Fr., F, Duke: Barrett will provide a bookend to Williamson as the pair has the potential to average in the high teens every game.

(7) Kyle Guy, Jr., G, Virginia: Guy is determined to erase the memory of the UMBC loss by taking the Cavs back to the top of the ACC. Guy has become one of the more reliable shooters under Tony Bennett.  (8) Caleb Martin, F, Sr., Nevada: Martin came back instead of staying in the NBA draft to join the most talented Wolf Pack roster ever. He has a chance to create a legacy with a trip to the Final Four.  (9) Rui Hachimura, Jr., F, Gonzaga: Hachimura has improved mightily in each season. He continues to embrace the role of being a go-to player on a roster that should make a run for the title.  (10) Tyus Battle, G, Jr., Syracuse: Battle flirted with staying in the NBA draft but he returns to lead the Orange a few steps further than the Sweet 16 last season. His numbers climbed during the season and he should be one of the more consistent scorers in the ACC.  (11) Shamarie Ponds, Jr., G, St. John’s: Ponds enters the season as one of the favorites for Big East player of the year. He is a must-watch guard who will have MSG rocking this season as the Red Storm rise toward an NCAA bid.  MORE: How do the preseason top 25 fare in March Madness?  (12) Markus Howard, Jr., G, Marquette: Howard put up 52 in a road game at Providence. He could be one of the top scorers in the country.

       " 'Kylie Jenner talked about why she enjoys changing diapers, how she and boyfriend Travis Scott came up with the name “Stormi” and what’s changed in her life since becoming a mother in an intimate interview published Wednesday.  Kim Kardashian conducted the interview with her younger sister for the Evening Standard, bringing up everything from Jenner’s career to her views on plastic surgery. But the 20-year-old beauty mogul had the most to say about little Stormi. She told Kardashian all about what surprised her most about motherhood and even admitted that she likes changing her daughter’s diapers.  “I think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I’m stressed about leaving her, I’m like, ‘I’m doing it for you,’” Jenner said. “Everyone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don’t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.”  She added, “But I feel like it’s only gotten better. You’re less selfish — and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It’s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don’t know, the whole thing is really… it’s like such an amazing experience.”  Scott and Jenner, who are currently on vacation together, celebrated their daughter’s three-month birthday on Tuesday, sharing an adorable photo on Instagram.  A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 8:46pm PDT  Jenner noted in the interview that she and Travis were originally thinking of just going with the name “Storm” instead of “Stormi.”  “I really don’t know how we thought of Storm. Her dad insisted it was him, but I feel like it was me. And that kind of just stuck with us,” she said.  “And then I didn’t really like just Storm — I didn’t feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi,” Kylie said. “And it just stuck. I feel like there were a lot of other names that I might have even liked better, to be honest, but I feel like Stormi picked her own name, like it was just her name.”  Jenner said that being a new mom has “been so amazing” and “so much fun” but she admitted things can sometimes be difficult.  “I’m learning so much more about myself and life, and it’s been such a great experience,” Kylie said. “Of course, there’s hard times and stuff … even in the beginning, just not sleeping, the nights, like, baby blues … and all the ups and downs.”  A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT  Stormi Webster was born on Feb. 1, weighing 8 lbs., 9 oz. She is the first child for both Jenner and Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster.  “Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life and I’m actually going to miss it,” Jenner said in an statement a few days after giving birth. “I’ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!”',\n",

Ed Sheeran hangs out with his best friend Taylor Swift’s ex Tom Hiddleston  The 26-year-old singer has confessed that being best friends with Taylor Swift allowed him to get close to (read: have sex with) lots of beautiful women, particularly when he was supporting her on tour.  Suffolk-born Ed, who counts Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding among his former conquests, seems beyond grateful to Taylor for this, which might explain the ‘arts and crafts’ Christmas presents he sends to her. WTF.  Ed with Taylor and Selena, one of which he’s been romantically linked to, last year (Picture: Getty)  Ed told Rolling Stone of his wingwoman: ‘Taylor’s world is celebrity. I was this 22-year-old awkward British kid going on tour with the biggest artist in America, who has all these famous mates.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘It was very easy [wooing the ladies]. I would often find myself in situations just kind of waking up and looking over and being like, “How the f**k did that happen?”.’  Gushing further about Taylor, Ed added: ‘She would be there if everything ended for me. Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense.  ‘She’s omnipresent because she’s the most famous woman in the world, so she can’t make the decision to not be in the press. I always stick up for Taylor.’  Elsewhere in the interview, Ed hinted he and his guardian angel will do a joint tour together and ‘trade songs’ during gigs, as Jay Z and Justin Timberlake did a few years ago.  No one is trying to deny Ed and Taylor are BFFs (Picture: Anna Webber/Getty Images for Atlantic Records)  Taylor, who was also interviewed by the mag for the same issue, backed this up — and claimed she and Ed are still very close, despite their geographical divide.  ‘We’ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other’s backs,’ Swift said.  ‘He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can’t imagine a time when he wouldn’t be.’  Ed is now in a serious relationship with Cherry Seaborn, and we expect she won’t want a repeat of the shenanigans on his and Taylor’s last tour together.

While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”\",\n",

       " 'What if I told you we’ve been watching Twin Peaks the wrong way all these years? What if I told you that David Lynch and Mark Frost’s seminal early-90s TV series didn’t have two seasons—but four? Let me explain:  For all these years, we’ve been engaging with Lynch and Frost’s series as two wildly uneven seasons—the first a perfect nine hours of suspense, surrealism, and shocking reveals, followed by a front-loaded and sprawling second season where the wheels come off. By contrast, the show can be organized into four shorter seasons,each around eight hours, each with a beginning, middle, and end, and each with their own thematic fixations and arcs.  A quote from Mark Frost spurred me to contemplate this new arrangement. In October 2014, BuzzFeed asked Frost why Showtime only ordered nine episodes. (If you recall, the new season was originally slated for nine installments. It’s since expanded to eighteen, a disparity I’ll discuss later.)  About the nine-episode length, Frost said:  “Well, if you think back about the first season, if you put the pilot together with the seven that we did, you get nine hours. It just felt like the right number. I’ve always felt the story should take as long as the story takes to tell. That’s what felt right to us.”  After reading Frost’s quote, I fixated on that nine-hour length, pondering the various ways different networks approach the concept of a “season” of television. The classic American network season runs more than twenty episodes and unspools over the course of several months, usually from September until the start of summer.  But as all of us TV nerds have learned in this, the Golden Era of Television, that’s not the only game in town. (Note: Spoilers for Mad Men and Breaking Bad appear in this graf.) Basic cable introduced us to shorter seasons—the first five seasons of HBO’s The Sopranos each ran for thirteen episodes, while its supersized sixth season ran for a more network-style twenty-one. (Though if you ask me, The Sopranos really ran for seven seasons, twelve episodes for season “six” and nine for season “seven.” As you can tell, I like reorganizing classic shows.) Other great basic-cable shows followed the “baker’s dozen” format. Mad Men’s first six seasons each ran for thirteen episodes, while its final season ran for fourteen. (I also prefer to think of Mad Men’s final season as two smaller seasons.) Breaking Bad’s first season ran a very Twin Peaks-y seven episodes, while its following four installments each ran thirteen. It’s fifth and final season ran sixteen episodes, split into two eight-episode legs across two years.  (Side note: There’s a related conversation to be had about the “BBC” model, where shows run for precisely as long as they need—The Office’s fourteen episodes and Sherlock’s twelve (so far). Both models have their virtues, but for now, I’m going to focus on the AMC model as it relates to Twin Peaks.)  Looking across these shows, we see the rise of a new phenomenon—the “midseason finale.” The midseason finale bears all the hallmarks of a standard finale—the protagonists usually find themselves in a bind or the narrative otherwise comes to a head. Mad Men and Breaking Bad both had their share of memorable midseason finales. “Waterloo” ended the first leg of Mad Men’s seventh season with such shocking twists as Bert Cooper’s death and the sale of SCD&P to McCann-Erickson. And of course, Breaking Bad’s now-legendary fifth midseason finale saw Hank Schraeder finally figure out the identity of Heisenberg.  Why am I talking about this? To soften you up to accept my thesis: that like all of the classic shows it sired, Twin Peaks followed a similar format over its twenty-nine-episode run, delivering about eight hours of television at a time, each with their own premieres and finales.  Coloquially, I refer to 12-13 episodes as the “AMC” model for season length. (And by “coloquially,” I mean “I’m the only person who uses that term because it’s a made-up thing.”) But for the sake of this essay, let me introduce a new made-up thing: the “Frost and Lynch”—or F&L—model for season length. The F&L model runs for seven to nine hours. Shorter and leaner than the AMC model, the F&L model skews more toward the BBC format, which favors the unity and symmetry of films and only calls on its TV seasons to run for precisely as long as they need to tell their stories.  So finally, let’s talk about The Four Seasons of Twin Peaks. I’ll specify how and where each season begins and ends, why I made the choices I did, all while discussing the strengths and weakness of each season—because believe me, some seasons are better than others.  Needless to say, MAJOR SPOILERS LIE AHEAD!  Season One: “Murder In A Small Town”  Pilot and episodes 1.1 through 1.7  The one unit of F&L-style seasonal storytelling you can spot with the naked eye is the first season of Twin Peaks, which also happens to be the actual, literal first season of the show. Starting with the now legendary pilot, the first season introduces us to the bizarre and byzantine world of Twin Peaks, with its interlocking network of rivalries, grudges, financial dealings, secret loves, and old hatreds—to say nothing of all the Norwegians, Brie sandwiches, black coffee, and delicious cherry pie.  Twin Peaks is many things—it’s a meditation on how evil can infest even the most good-hearted people; it’s a TV version of Blue Velvet; it’s a portrait of a small town in mourning. It’s also a cannily self-aware goof on TV itself, using the tropes and traditions of classic TV—including and especially barn-burning night-time soaps and the cornpone sitcoms of the 60s and 70s. Frost, an alum of such meat ’n’ potatoes dramas as Hill Street Blues, helped Lynch build a reliably engrossing cast of regulars, some of whom could’ve been lifted out of Dynasty or Dallas (Josie Packard, Catherine Martell, the Hornes); while others hailed more from Mayberry or Green Acres (Sheriff Truman, Andy, Lucy, Hawk). That unusual division makes for a pleasing “court and mechanicals” rift among the series regulars—a rift spanned by the show’s lead, the boundlessly kind and intuitive Agent Dale Cooper. Cooper (a stand-in of sorts for Lynch) serves many functions in the narrative—he drives the investigation into Laura Palmer’s murder, he provides key exposition—but more than anything else, he’s good. He’s decent and kind and empathetic, and in a show that’s largely about a battle between kindness and cruelty, he’s our greatest, clearest, most shining avatar for the former.  But anyway, let’s get back to season one, which unfolds over the course of nine of the most perfect hours ever seen on television. I get goosebumps when I recall some of its best moments—when the gang discovers the mysterious cabin where Laura and Ronette spent some of their harrowing final moments; when Coop asks Hawk if he believes in souls (“Several,” comes Hawk’s prescient answer).  The first season also includes some of the finest examples of what makes Twin Peaks so influential: its willingness to smuggle arthouse imagery onto mainstream television. Sometimes that imagery is a simple combination of the daft and the terrifying, such as when Waldo the parrot gets it: Perched above an exquisite arrangement of doughnuts, Waldo chillingly recites Laura’s sorry pleas before an unseen gunman silences him, spattering the bird’s blood across the table.  Other times that imagery is… well, this:  Among its many virtues, Twin Peaks acted as a Trojan horse for arthouse imagery, techniques, impulses, and methods. It gave David Lynch a nationwide showcase for his mastery of dream-logic—and that daring has echoed across the following decades. I’d argue with confidence that not only did Twin Peaks sire the current golden age of television, but also that it specifically paved the way for shows like The Sopranos and Mad Men, both of which traffic in dream-logic storytelling.  Season One at a Glance  Strengths: Narrative tightness, dreamy imagery, perfect introductions—and every episode is a classic.  Weaknesses: I’ve never liked how Major Briggs strikes Bobby in the pilot. It’s always felt like an early-development misstep—a flashy choice they made before they really got to know the character.  Best episode: This was a tough choice between the pilot and episode three, “Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer,” but episode three scores a narrow victory. From beginning to end, it’s a perfect episode, packed with unforgettable scenes—from the opening introduction of a baguette-bearing Jerry Horne to Coop’s rock-toss to the now-immortal first visit to the Black Lodge, it introduced the imagery and perfected the particular off-kilter tone and humor that made Twin Peaks a hit.  Second-best episode: I’m a huge fan of the season-one finale. It’s the only episode written and directed entirely by Mark Frost, and it shows. One of Twin Peaks’ myriad delights is the ongoing storytelling tension between its two eminent showrunners—Lynch is withholding and abstract, Frost generous and straightforward. Well, that straightforwardness makes for a rousing, headlong finale. I mean, it’s simply packed with stuff happening: the mill gets blown up, Andy shoots Jacques Renault, and of course, Coop gets shot.  Season Two: “The Investigation”  Episodes 2.1 through 2.7  My toughest choice for this essay was where to place the “second” season finale. Given that the first 15-16 episodes all bear on the revelation (and death) of Laura’s murderer, I had a few options. Does the “season” end right after her killer is revealed, in episode seven, “Lonely Souls”? Or does it end when her killer dies in episode nine, “Arbitrary Law”?  I eventually decided to make episode seven, “Lonely Souls,” the finale. Here’s why: If you were to plot the episodes of Twin Peaks on a graph where the Y-axis represented an amalgam of quality and thematic payload, you’d see several spikes, usually when Lynch and Frost dropped in to write and direct an episode. They dropped in less and less often as the series went on, turning over the major writing duties to a team that came to be dominated by Harley Peyton and Robert Engels (who was a major contributor to both the series finale and the movie, Fire Walk With Me), and an eclectic crew of directors that included television journeymen (or journeywomen) like Lesli Linka Glatter, Todd Holland, and Tim Hunter, as well as some oddballs like Diane Keaton (whose episode ain’t bad) and Uli Edel.  But the Lynch episodes carry an especial level of importance, and if we also factor the series finale into this equation, we further find that the series’ major events revolve around the activity of the BOB entity.  And on that note, let commence an aria about the Twin Peaks that could’ve been:  By now, it’s conventional wisdom that ABC screwed up the show by forcing Lynch and Frost to reveal the identity of Laura’s killer. It robbed the narrative of its momentum and revealed the execs’ fundamental misunderstanding of what Twin Peaks was—it was never a murder mystery. It was a demented and dreamy portrait of a small town. Laura Palmer’s murder was simply an initial, delicious hook to reel in the audience. In a better world, the showrunners would’ve been able to delay the revelation of Laura’s murderer until the series had run its course, saving its most dramatically satisfying reveal for the series’ final movements, much in the same manner as The Fugitive, which saved the capture of the one-armed murderer (himself referenced in Twin Peaks’ own one-armed man) for its series finale.  But here’s the thing: not even ABC could completely screw up a show this good. Happily, the revelation of Laura’s killer only raised a larger, more inscrutable question: What exactly is happening in Twin Peaks? That structure—answering one question while raising others—was forced upon Lynch and Frost, but they handled it gamely, establishing a modus operandi later imitated by shows like LOST. (Side note—LOST ain’t perfect, but damn if it isn’t the closest thing we’ve had over the years to the kind of week-to-week weirdness that Twin Peaks delivered. I rewatched it recently, and it remains one of the all-time great shows.) In any event, here’s the point of my aria: Lynch and Frost are master showrunners. When forced to solve their story’s central mystery, they deftly redirected the show’s energies into a new and larger mystery: what is BOB?  So endeth my aria. Let’s try to focus on taking about what actually happens in my proposed season two: we meet some intriguing new characters (Lenny von Dohlen’s Harold Smith, among others) and delve deeper into to the investigation of Laura’s murder. We also learn that while Laura’s murderer was technically her father, Leland (the incomparable Ray Wise), we also learn that he was under the possession of the malevolent entity BOB.  This season also sets up the following two seasons in my arrangement: Coop gets word that his old nemesis, Windom Earle, may be at large again, while Major Briggs hints that something paranormal may be afoot in the woods surrounding Twin Peaks.  Season Two at a Glance  Strengths: Momentum established in season one carries through the end of this season. We find out who killed Laura. We learn more about the entity BOB. Premiere and finale are both top-notch episodes.  Weaknesses: That “season one” magic starts to fade, but otherwise, I’d argue this season is as strong as season one.  Best episode: “Lonely Souls.”  Season Three: “Aftermath”  Episodes 2.8 through 2.14  Well, it was nice while it lasted.  My “third” season of Twin Peaks compartmentalizes all of the series’ weakest elements. Its worst storylines and worst episodes can all be found in this seven-episode stretch, which sees James ditch town for a pointless fling, Nadine succumb to retrograde amnesia, and Ben Horne become a Confederate war general. Hoo boy.  On the plus side, there are some great episodes in here. The Tim Hunter-directed ninth episode, “Arbitrary Law”—which unmasks Laura’s killer—features one of the series’ most powerful scenes—Coop cradling a dying Leland after he confesses to the crime. As the jail’s malfunctioning sprinklers rain upon them, Coop recites from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, providing Leland absolution before he dies. On the writing side, Harley Peyton and Robert Engels start to take the reigns. I have no idea if either of them emerged as defacto showrunner, but I generally dig their episodes.  As for the “third” season finale, I decided on “Double Play.” Windom Earle’s first appearance onscreen remains a strong moment, and it kicks off the action for my proposed “fourth” season.  Strengths: Although the show jumps the proverbial shark in its “third” season, it’s still got that Twin Peaks magic, which lends it incredible charm even through its weakest stretch. Gary Hershberger’s Mike, basically unseen since the pilot, gets to shine. Windom Earle’s impending entry to the fray is legitimately menacing.  Weaknesses: Too many to count.  Best episode: “Arbitrary Law.”  Season Four: “Project Blue Book”  Episodes 2.15 through 2.22  Twin Peaks was the first show I binged.  This was years before Netflix streaming, years even before Netflix’s DVD-by-mail service. I was just out of college, and although I’d seen the show’s first season (as well as the movie—don’t judge me), I’d never watched the show in its entirety. Luckily, my mom’d given me the complete series on VHS (!) for my birthday. Over the course of a week, I watched the whole series in grainy, pan-and-scan, LP glory.  Ever since that first viewing, the awesomeness of the final eight episodes has lingered with me. When I first encountered the Black Lodge, I felt sure that it’d be impossible for the showrunners to explain what it was without robbing it of its power.  Boy, was I wrong.  Over the course of eight episodes, Twin Peaks imports themes and devices from shows like The Night-Stalker and The X-Files, pitching the Black Lodge as a sort of interdimensional nexus. You can only access it from certain places, and while it’s well-nigh impossible to escape, if you do, you’re liable to pop out at any place—or any time—in the world.  Shows like Twin Peaks often straddle the line between science-fiction and fantasy until they’re forced to commit to one. LOST began as a crunchy sci-fi epic in the mode of MYST but eventually committed to contemporary fantasy in its final seasons, much to its detriment, I’d argue. But Twin Peaks gets to have its cake and eat it by treating the Black Lodge as neither magic or science, but paranormal and preternatural. Twin Peaks draws on a great many American folk myths, including an old favorite of mine, the Mothman. As the story goes, the Mothman is an extradimensional entity that supposedly menaced the town of Point Pleasnt, W.Va., in the late sixties, wreaking all manner of mind-bending havoc—delivering confusing reports about the future, teleporting people great distances, and inducing selective amnesia (or time-loss) among its victims. If you ask me, encountering the Mothman sounds a lot like a visit to the Black Lodge. (Side note, Mark Pellington’s 2002 movie The Mothman Prophecies is worth a look. It’s based on John Keel’s (supposedly) nonfiction book of the same name.)  Anyway, in its “fourth” season, Twin Peaks deepens its mythology, placing the eccentric hamlet at the center of an interdimensional superhighway. Incidentally, more of this deeper mythmaking bubbles up in the prequel movie, Fire Walk With Me, as well as its companion work, The Missing Pieces—basically ninety minutes of deleted scenes from the movie. In FWWM and The Missing Pieces, we glimpse new realms (and new citizens) of the Black Lodge, while also bearing witness to some of its temperospatial aftereffects—David Bowie’s Phillip Jeffries teleports across the world in the manner of the X-Men’s Nightcrawler, while Heather Graham’s Annie Blackburn appears to Laura Palmer to warn her of future calamity.  Strengths: An alluringly creepy, paranormal tone. The finale is one of the greatest episodes in TV history.  Weaknesses: The sharp turn into X-Files territory may not be to everyone’s liking, but it’s certainly to mine.  Best episode: “Beyond Life and Death.”  So those are my proposed four seasons of Twin Peaks. What do you think? How might you rearrange the episodes, if at all? Should someone assemble a new prequel miniseries built from FWWM and The Missing Pieces?  Also, what does the eighteen-episode revival herald in terms of storytelling? Will Lynch and Frost adhere to the F&L model, delivering two nine-episode “seasons” to us? Or have they essentially written an eighteen-hour movie that’ll unspool in a way none of us can predict?  I don’t know the answer. All I do know is I can’t wait.',\n",

In a Facebook post on Wednesday, former actress Aurélie Wynn (known professionally as Aurelie Marie Cao) claimed that Westwick raped her in 2014. Westwick has denied the allegations.  In her post Wynn wrote, “[A]nd like Kristina, I said no and he pushed me face down and was powerless under his weight. I was wearing a one piece bathing suit that he ripped, I was in complete shock, I am also very tiny.”  Wynn wrote that she told her boyfriend at the time, Glee actor Mark Salling, about the incident. Salling, who has since pleaded guilty for possession of child pornography, allegedly broke up with her and blamed her. She also wrote that she was encouraged by friends to stay quiet and that people would think she was “just out trying to get my 10 seconds of fame.”  Westwick responded to Cohen’s claims on Tuesday in an Instagram post saying he did not know Cohen and had never raped anybody.  A post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 7, 2017 at 8:46am PST  Cohen filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department, which is now investigating if the “suspect forced victim to have sexual intercourse inside his residence … three years ago.”  Following Wynn’s allegations, Westwick posted a second denial on Instagram on Thursday.

Career  Nickelback  In the early 1990s, Kroeger was part of a grunge cover band, The Village Idiots, with his cousin Brandon Kroeger and future Nickelback members bassist Mike Kroeger (his brother) and singer Ryan Peake. In 1995, Kroeger, Peake, Mike Kroeger, and then drummer Brandon Kroeger[11], formed the band Nickelback. Kroeger has continued to record and tour with this successful band for more than 20 years.  The Suits XL  In 2001, Kroeger, with the help of lawyer Jonathan Simkin, founded the band The Suits XL.[12] Band members included Sam Loubier-Demers and Yohann Gosselin on vocals and guitars, drummer Patrick Paquet, keyboardist Felix-Antoine Berube and singer Oliver Roy de Belleval. The next year, he co-founded the Vancouver, British Columbia-based 604 Records.[7] Later, in 2006, The Suits XL released an album through this label.[12][13] The next year the band was nominated for a Canadian Indie Award.[14]  Collaborations  Kroeger produced music for the bands Default, Theory of a Deadman, and Bo Bice.[citation needed]  Kroeger, along with Saliva vocalist Josey Scott, Theory of a Deadman lead vocalist (serving as guitarist for this track) Tyler Connolly and Our Lady Peace drummer Jeremy Taggart, performed the theme song titled \"Hero\" for the hit movie Spider-Man in 2002. Also in 2002, Kroeger wrote and sang on \"Why Don\\'t You & I\" for Santana\\'s Shaman. However, when Arista decided to release the song as a single in Summer 2003, Kroeger\\'s label, Roadrunner, refused permission, citing concerns that Kroeger appearing on a \"high-profile single\" would compromise the excitement over Nickelback\\'s fall 2003 release The Long Road. Kroeger recommended The Calling\\'s Alex Band, another Arista artist, as a replacement for re-recording the single.[15][16]  In 2003, Kroeger won an International Achievement Award for the song \"Hero\" at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.[17]  In 2007, Chad Kroeger worked with Santana for a second time, when he co-wrote and recorded guitar and vocals parts for a new song meant to appear on the compilation album Ultimate Santana. The track is called \"Into the Night\" and was released as a single on October 2, 2007. The album Ultimate Santana was released in October. Besides working with Santana, Kroeger also recorded with Travis Tritt on his album The Storm, where Tritt did a cover of Nickelback\\'s \"Should\\'ve Listened\" track from The Long Road.  Kroeger also wrote and played guitar on Bo Bice\\'s You\\'re Everything.  Chad Kroeger, Eric Dill, Rune Westberg and Chris Daughtry wrote the debut single of Daughtry\\'s new album.[18] The single, titled \"No Surprise\", was debuted on American Idol Wednesday, May 6, 2009.

       " 'Brown, however, tried and failed to get Tran’s case against him dismissed, and his attorney was admonished for not addressing LaCour’s petition. Here’s what went down: Tran’s lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown’s camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days’ notice, not seven.  As Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress’ best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.  Initially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown’s legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. “What they didn’t take into consideration was the other case,” one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We’re told Brown’s attorneys “came swooping into court” expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans’ absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown “didn’t show up either,” despite another petitioner “ready to go.”  Gossip Cop hears Brown’s attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, “his lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue” about the second case, we’re told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a “mockery” of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.  And in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It’s also worth noting that Brown’s lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn’t even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place. Last month, Tran’s manager slammed Geragos for accusing her of making up the domestic violence allegations for self-promotion. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates.',\n",

The film tells the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who notoriously murdered their parents in 1989. It premieres June 11th.  Along with Love, Menendez stars Nico Tortorella and Myko Olivier as brothers Lyle and Erik, and Benito Martinez as the family patriarch, Jose Menendez. The new trailer highlights the abuse Jose inflicted upon his sons, as well as Kitty’s inability to protect her sons or stop her husband. In quintessential Lifetime movie fashion, the trailer boasts a scene in which Kitty looks nervously into a mirror in a dark room while whispering in a voice over, “Just get through this day Kitty, tomorrow will be different.”  Elsewhere in the clip, the Menendez brothers plot and carry out their parents’ murder and enjoy a surprise respite of freedom before the swift hammer of justice comes down – which of course prompts some furious telephone smashing in a seedy motel room.  The Menendez brothers’ trial became became a national sensation as the brothers testified about their father’s history of abuse. After a deadlocked jury and mistrial, Erik and Lyle were retried and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, attendees at Paris Fashion Week were less than sympathetic after Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in her hotel room early Monday morning.  \"Well, she should stop Instagramming pictures of herself in her hotel bathroom,\" an American magazine contributor told The Hollywood Reporter.  Another American fashion editor joked, \"She was probably drunk after the L’Oreal party and let them in accidentally. Or she tagged herself there. Criminals can have Instagram too.\" (Note: Kardashian famously does not drink.)  And some just questioned the entire ordeal, with a British journalist asking, \"Where did they get a gun? Sounds fake.\"  💎💎💎 A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 29, 2016 at 12:40pm PDT  Yahoo Style also overheard one editor at a show expressing little surprise at the incident.  “That’s what happens when you invite cameras around every time you go shopping for more designer stuff.”  Kim Kardashian attends the Givenchy show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2017 on Oct. 2, 2016 in Paris.  According to E! News, Kim was \"gagged and bound at her hands and feet, then handcuffed at gunpoint\" Monday morning. Five men left her tied up in a bathroom before stealing over US$10 million worth of jewelry.  \"She begged for them to let her live and [said] she had babies at home. Then they wrapped her mouth in tape and put her in the bathtub,\" the source told E!

TMZ reports the mother of North and Saint West was \"lying in bed with only her robe on when she heard boots pounding up the stairs of her two-storey apartment.\" She reportedly saw a masked man and another wearing a police hat through the glass sliding door, and tried calling her bodyguard, Pascal Duvier, on her cell phone, but the phone was ripped out of her hands by one of the men before she could finish dialing.

       " 'The series based on the IDW novel of the same name has landed a 10-episode order at the streaming giant.  Netflix and Ian Somerhalder are ready to fight the V-Wars.  The streaming giant has handed out a 10-episode, straight-to-series order for vampire drama V-Wars, based on the IDW novel of the same name, with the Vampire Diaries alum set to star. The order comes as another IDW property, the beloved Locke and Key, is awaiting word on a new home after Hulu\\'s surprising pass on the pilot.  V-Wars revolves around Dr. Luther Swann (Somerhalder), who enters a world of horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne, into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these vampires. Swann races against time to understand what’s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.  The series is based on IDW Publishing\\'s V-Wars franchise, written by New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry. High Park Entertainment produces alongside IDW Entertainment, which will distribute the series worldwide (excluding Canada). 1-800-Missing creators William Laurin and Glenn Davis will serve as showrunners. Brad Turner (Stargate, Stargate Atlantis) will direct and exec produce. High Park\\'s Eric Birnberg and Thomas Walden will exec produce alongside IDW Entertainment president David Ozer, IDW CEO Ted Adams and Marada Pictures\\' James Gibb.  \"We could not have dreamed of a better choice than Ian Somerhalder to bring his keen understanding of this genre from his years of starring in The Vampire Diaries to lead the cast of V-Wars as Dr. Luther Swann and to be a creative force on this series, as well as to serve as a director this season. We are thrilled to partner with Netflix to bring the multifaceted world that Jonathan Maberry created to audiences worldwide.\"  V-Wars was first announced in 2014 as part of a straight-to-series deal with Entertainment One. That company, as well as the drama\\'s original writer and producers Circle of Confusion are no longer attached. The pickup comes as IDW\\'s Locke and Key is being shopped to other streaming outlets, among others, as the company looks to find a new home for the Carlton Cuse drama based on Joe Hill\\'s beloved comic series. Despite multiple attempts to bring the series to both the big and small screen, IDW remains committed to finding the project a creative home.  For Somerhalder, meanwhile, V-Wars arrives a year after he signed off of The CW\\'s Vampire Diaries following its eight-season run. He currently has a pod deal with TVD producers Warner Bros. Television with actress Nikki Reed, his wife, via their Rare Bird Productions banner. He is repped by ICM Partners, Untitled Entertainment and Morris Yorn.  V-Wars arrives as Netflix continues to spend an estimated $8 billion annually on original programming. The genre drama joins a roster of Marvel fare including the recently renewed Jessica Jones and gives the streamer a series vampire drama as The CW is prepping the final season of Vampire Diaries spinoff The Originals, while working on yet another offshoot from the franchise. The genre remains popular with NBC\\'s Midnight, Texas, and Syfy\\'s Van Helsing, among others.',\n",

       " 'Bonnie and Clyde pair get second chance after announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Academy Awards  At the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are getting a mulligan: the Bonnie and Clyde pair will present the Oscar for best picture again, one year after they infamously announced La La Land, instead of the actual winner, Moonlight.  After Weinstein: why this year’s Oscars are make or break Read more  Last year Beatty and Dunaway presented the night’s top honor to mark the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde. When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land’s Emma Stone, with that of best picture.  For several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award.  This year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said “presenting is better the second time around”. Beatty replied: “The winner is Gone with the Wind.”  Other confirmed presenters during this year’s telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong’o, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Guillermo del Toro’s 60s-set romantic fantasy The Shape of Water leads the way with 13 nominations.',\n",
       " 'Matthew James Morrison (born October 30, 1978)[1] is an American actor, dancer, and singer-songwriter. Morrison is known for starring in multiple Broadway and Off-Broadway productions, including his portrayal of Link Larkin in Hairspray on Broadway, and for his role as Will Schuester on the Fox television show Glee (2009–2015). Morrison is signed with Adam Levine\\'s 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza. From March 2015 to January 2016, Morrison starred in the lead role of J.M. Barrie in the Broadway production of Finding Neverland.  Early life [ edit ]  Morrison was born in Fort Ord, California, the son of Mary Louise (Fraser) and Thomas Morrison.[2] Morrison was raised in Chico, California, and has Scottish and English ancestry.[3][4] He was part of the Collaborative Arts Project 21 (CAP21) and the Orange County High School of the Arts, while at the Los Alamitos High School campus. While in high school, Morrison did a musical with actress Jodie Sweetin. He attended New York University\\'s Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5]  By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, \"There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.\"[6]  Career [ edit ]  Morrison\\'s career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002. Morrison\\'s big break came, however, when Morrison landed the role of Link Larkin in the Broadway production of John Waters\\', Hairspray. After performing in the role for some time, Morrison started working in television, guest-starring on shows such as Ghost Whisperer, Numb3rs, CSI: Miami and Hack. Morrison also had small roles in films such as Marci X, Primary Colors, Music and Lyrics, and Simply Funk. Morrison followed up these performances by performing the role of Sir Harry in the ABC-TV production of Once Upon a Mattress, starring Tracey Ullman, Zooey Deschanel and Carol Burnett.  In 2001, Morrison was recruited to complete the quartet for the band LMNT. Morrison was replaced instead by Jonas Persch by the time its first album was released. Morrison commented in an interview about his experience in the boy band by remarking, \"It was the worst year of my life. You know when you\\'re a performer and you\\'re out there on stage and you\\'re embarrassed that you\\'re doing something wrong. It was pretty bad.\" Matthew Morrison also was a member of Buena Park Youth theater, located at Buena Park[7]  Morrison starred in the Original Cast of the musical Hairspray as Link Larkin from its opening in 2002 through January 2004.[8] In 2005 Morrison changed gears, playing the role of Fabrizio Nacarelli in Adam Guettel\\'s The Light in the Piazza.[8] Morrison was nominated for a Tony Award for his performance.[9] He left the show August 28, 2005.[9]  Morrison joined the cast of the CBS soap opera, As the World Turns, as Adam Munson on October 24, 2006,[10] but left abruptly soon after due to a \"scheduling conflict,\" last airing on the soap on November 27.

In 2008, he played Lieutenant Cable in a Lincoln Center production of the musical South Pacific. He left the production at the end of 2008 and in early 2009 returned to California to shoot the first season of Glee.[11]  Morrison played Will Schuester in the Fox Broadcasting television series Glee, which had its television preview on May 19, 2009. He resumed his role in the show as the series premiered on September 9, 2009. He plays a high school Spanish teacher who takes on the task of restoring the school\\'s glee club to its former glory. Morrison also appeared in the show\\'s second season. He returned for the third season, which premiered on September 20, 2011.[12] He made his directorial debut in the third season\\'s ninth episode.

Morrison was on the cover of the June 2011 issue of MetroSource.  In March 2012, Morrison was featured in a performance of Dustin Lance Black\\'s play, 8—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California\\'s Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as Paul Katami.[16] The production was held at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube to raise money for the American Foundation for Equal Rights.[17][18]  A Morrison concert at Connecticut\\'s Bushnell Center was recorded by PBS and scheduled to air in spring 2013.[19] On April 28, 2013, Morrison made his first major appearance[citation needed] in the UK as a guest performer at the 2013 Laurence Olivier Awards at the Royal Opera House in London.

Are Katy Perry, 33, and Robert Pattinson, 31, dating? They were reportedly spotted kissing during a group dinner on Jan. 26 at Taix French Restaurant in Los Angeles, a witness told Wonderwall.com. “They were making out,” an onlooker told the website. The witness also added that their behavior made it seem like they were “totally a couple.” Eek! See pictures of Katy and Rob together here.  The Twilight actor ended his engagement to FKA Twigs, 30, in Oct. 2017, and, as we’ve previously reported, he started getting close with the “Swish Swish” singer in the aftermath of the split. “Rob’s been talking and texting with Katy, and they’ve become super super close,” a source close to Rob previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “There’s always been a really strong chemistry between them, and a definite attraction, but they’ve never acted on it, because all the time they’ve known each other one or other of them has been involved with someone else.”  The pair have both been single since his breakup with his former fiancée, but Rob didn’t immediately try to start a new relationship last fall out of respect. “There’s no doubt that he’s really into Katy, and that he fancies her like crazy, but, he’s determined to not get in to some kind of rebound romance — he respects and cares about Katy way too much to risk blowing the friendship they currently have,” our insider added. The American Idol judge was last romantically involved with Orlando Bloom, 41, but they ended their relationship in Feb. 2017. While nothing is confirmed yet on whether or not Rob and Katy are ~official~ we’ll be holding our breath until we find out more about this blossoming romance!

The Life of Kylie star turned 20 on Thursday, and she took to her website and app to celebrate by sharing a few “moments that made the last year of my life so great.”  Up first? She expanded her family — her dog family, that is. Her two Italian greyhounds, Norman and Bambi, had surprise babies!  “My babies had babies!” she gushed. “Can’t you handle how cute little Harlie and Rosie are?!”  Jenner also hit a few milestones in her professional life, starting with the creation of The Kylie Shop (“Creating my own merch was a dream come true for me!”) and her booming cosmetics company. But of all her Kylie Cosmetics creations, she’s most proud of her special-edition lip kit with Smile Train, a non-profit organization that provides support and corrective surgery for children in developing countries with the birth condition.  “I donated 100 percent of the net proceeds from my Smile Lip Kit to Smile Train, which provides cleft surgery for children in the developing world,” she said. “Presenting them with the check was big moment for me!”  Of course, several of the reality star’s favorite moments were style- and beauty-related, starting with going blonde for New York Fashion Week, a process which “took a couple of days” but was “so worth it.” There was also the 2017 Met Ball, which she “still can’t believe” she attended with Donatella Versace. (In case you were curious, her custom sheer Atelier Versace dress with floral embellishment and beaded fringe was another “dream come true.”)  FROM PEN: Rose Byrne Reveals the ‘Rolls-Royce of Spanx’ She Wore to the Met Gala  And while every day is basically a photo shoot in the Life of Kylie, her two favorites were her 2017 calendar shoot with Terry Richardson (something she’d been wanting to do “forever”) and her Barbie-themed Flaunt magazine shoot.

       " 'It\\'s a good time to be a \\'90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel\\'s Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart\\'s career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today — she\\'s back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future — but she\\'s not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O\\'Neal?  I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa\\'s bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O\\'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O\\'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There\\'s not much out there about O\\'Neal\\'s later years, but here\\'s what I could find.  Noir  In 2001, O\\'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint.  RahXephon  O\\'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002.  Development Hell  O\\'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company.  Today  That\\'s unfortunately all we know about O\\'Neal\\'s post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I\\'m sure it\\'s been a struggle for the other Sean O\\'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All.  (You can see why we\\'d all believe it, though.)  Screencrush reported that when it was active, O\\'Neal\\'s website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, \"he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and \\'N Sync.\" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I\\'m pretty sure all of Sam\\'s many fans would\\'ve gladly bought his album — and there\\'s no record of it ever existing. Here\\'s what appears to a recent photo of O\\'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes.  So where\\'d you go, O\\'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many \\'90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line — or better yet, just climb in through the window.

       " 'EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and his former business managers will not be kicking off a potential messy and revealing trial over the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald star’s long-held fraud claims of $25 million next month after all.  After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear. While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.  Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one, the managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP comes after the actor’s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D.C.’s Brown Rudick failed late last month to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back. It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor. Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.  Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.  Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.  Following the submission of that paperwork, the settlement agreement is expected to be approved before the August 15 trial start date, which is basically a moot note on the calendar at this point. A fact that will make Warner Bros very happy as sources say that the studio was not looking forward to a public hearing of The Crimes of Grindelwald’s marketing campaign and opening this fall of the latest installment in this J.K. Rowling’s franchise being flooded by headlines of Depp’s allegedly excessive spending habits and dwindling financial resources.  While the bloodletting between the actor and TMG is over now, the settlement in that matter does not, however, end the other litigation tidal waves that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is wading through. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorneyJacob Bloom and his. Claiming cahoots with TMG, the actor went after Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP for $30 million last fall. They went right back after him a couple of months later as the actor seemed for a while to be shedding lawyers at an alarming rate  In addition, Depp’s legal dance card was hit last week with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.  So, let’s call it one down, a lot more to go when it comes to Johnny Depp and the courts right now.  In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down. Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.',\n",

Saudi authorities have raised the profile of the King Abdulaziz camel festival by relocating it from the desert to the outskirts of the capital, Riyadh.  This year’s event has been been mired in scandal after the lure of 20m Saudi riyals (£3.7m) in prize money for each category tempted some owners to cheat.  The key attributes in camel beauty are considered to be delicate ears and big nose. But there are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips, or shaved or clipped body parts.    This year, a dozen camels were banned after a vet was caught performing plastic surgery on them. Camels were also given Botox-type injections at his clinic, according to Saudi media.  “They use Botox for the lips, the nose, the upper lips, the lower lips and even the jaw,” Ali al-Mazrouei, the son of an Emirati camel breeder, told the UAE daily the National.  “It makes the head more inflated so when the camel comes it’s like, ‘Oh, look at how big that head is. It has big lips, a big nose.’”  After the ban was imposed, the chief judge of the show, Fawzan al-Madi, told Reuters: “The camel is a symbol of Saudi Arabia. We used to preserve it out of necessity, now we preserve it as a pastime.”  The month-long festival is the biggest in the Gulf and involves up 30,000 camels.',\n",

       " \"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  “The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.”  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.”  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £250,000 — about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET.  But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons.\",\n",

The singer, 41, and wife Brittany Kerr, 30, planned a sweet baseball-themed gender reveal party for his two daughters and their 9-month-old son this weekend.  The couple, who announced the pregnancy last month, wanted to share the news with the kids in a special way. \"Jason and I already know what it is, so this is just for the girls to see their excitement,\" Brittany said in a post Jason shared on Instagram.  In the video, fans get to see Jason\\'s two daughters from his first marriage, Keeley, 15, and Kendyl, 10, both make their prediction about the gender. Both girls got their wish when they took a swing at their respective baseballs and watched as they burst into pink powder.  Though their son Memphis is a little too young to have made his own guess, he did play a starring role in their original announcement, which included a photo of the baby boy in a \"big brother\" onesie.  Jason and Brittany were hoping for another child, but they weren\\'t sure it would be possible after having to undergo in vitro fertilization treatments to conceive Memphis. \"We did IVF with our son, so we had to do that again with this one,\" Jason told People.com.    The country crooner also shared that he and Brittany were hoping to give Memphis another sibling close in age. “After having our son, we knew we wanted to have two kids,” Jason added. “I have my two older daughters already, so after Memphis was born we knew we wanted to have another one pretty quick.\"  Congratulations, Aldean family!',\n",

       " 'It seems like every day, someone steps forward with a sexual harassment or abuse allegation against someone they’ve had to work with. While the situations themselves are upsetting, it’s powerful to see so many women speak out. Parents may wonder how to address these multiple allegations with their children, which is why we’re happy that Candace Cameron Bure opened up about sexual harassment, and how she’s handling the topic.  The Fuller House star has three teens at home — Natasha, Lev, and Maksim. Natasha is already in the public eye, having competed on The Voice back in 2016. Based on her exposure, Cameron Bure stated that she’s already had the conversation with her before, telling E! News that “Those are conversations that we have and really that I’ve been having with my children since they were young because that’s what parenting is about and helping them be secure with who they are and having moral boundaries and knowing what’s right and what’s wrong and what’s appropriate for people to ask of you and not and not to be afraid to speak out.”  Making sure to emphasize incredible lessons like this may explain why Cameron Bure and her children are so close.  Cameron Bure noted to E! News that she hasn’t been in a situation similar to the victims who are stepping forward, but has nothing but love and support for the women who have been put in these dangerous situations.  \"It\\'s horrific listening to all the stories,\" she said. \"Thinking about what so many women have gone through and the courage they have to come out as well. I\\'m glad it\\'s all being exposed and I hope that we can eventually put an end to it.\"  We’re so glad that Cameron Bure is addressing the topic, and applaud her for starting the conversation with her family so early.',\n",

       " 'The fact that Marlon Brando’s numerous sex partners over his lifetime included men is nothing new. Various posthumous biographies have mentioned his bisexuality, and Brando himself was quoted in one of those biographies as saying he had “homosexual experiences.”  “Like a large number of men, I too have had homosexual experiences and am not ashamed,” Brando was quoted in “Marlon Brando, the Only Contender,” according to the New York Daily News.  The late Richard Pryor also would not be ashamed of the fact that he and Brando enjoyed one of those experiences, Pryor’s widow Jennifer Pryor told TMZ Wednesday.  The Brando-Pryor hookup first came to light in Quincy Jones’ candid and wide-ranging interview published Wednesday in Vulture. The legendary music producer said he and Brando were longtime friends. So he said he was aware that the Academy Award-winning actor, who embodied a certain male ideal in “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “On the Waterfront,” liked to have sex — lots of sex.  Jones added that Brando’s partners included other prominent artists and entertainers including James Baldwin, Marvin Gaye — and Richard Pryor. When the Vulture writer asked if Brando really slept with these men, Jones laughingly said, “Come on, man. He did not give a (expletive).”  Jennifer Pryor, the comedy legend’s fourth and final wife, said her husband was similarly inclined to have sex with lots of different partners, female or male.  This was especially true in 1970s — after he emerged from the Berkeley counter-culture to enjoy mainstream success in comedy, on TV and in films.  One of those partners was Brando, she said about her husband, who died in 2005.  “It was the ’70s!” Jennifer Pryor said. “Drugs were still good, especially quaaludes. If you did enough cocaine, (have sex) with a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.”  She didn’t specify when this hookup with Brando occurred, whether it was as the actor regained his stardom during “The Godfather” and “Last Tango in Paris” years — or in the later 1970s when the actor seemed to just enjoy raking in money and phoning in performances in films like “Superman,” while putting on weight. Brando died in 2004.  Most of all, Jennifer Pryor told TMZ that Pryor wouldn’t have been ashamed about the liaison, given that he was always open about his bisexuality with friends. His sexual orientation also was documented in Scott Saul’s biography “Laughter Along the Path to Oblivion: Becoming Richard Pryor,” the New York Times reported.',\n",
       " 'Thursday is Valentine’s Day! Can you believe it?! Yes, it’s the day Hallmark is king and restaurants are filled to the brim. If you haven’t made your reservations yet, you may be standing for hours at the door come Thursday evening. For us, knowing that Valentine’s Day is the busiest night of the year for restaurants, we have chosen to stay home this year for Valentine’s Day and keep the home-fire burning instead. Think you might want to do the same? If so, then maybe some of these at-home date night ideas may be an inspiration for you as well. After all, the cost is usually cheaper, the atmosphere is often quieter, and the intimacy has no limits…well, unless you still have kids awake. In that case, I’d just send them to bed early with a good book! 😉 Here is to a Happy Valentine’s Day!  Spend the night on the living room floor. Set up the air mattress. Roast marshmallows in the fireplace. Have a picnic dinner on the floor. Make dinner together. Choose the menu and get the ingredients ahead of time, then have fun cooking, taste-testing, and eating together. Have a board game night. Choose a favorite board game and feel free to play the traditional way or with an extra romantic twist. The choice is yours. Watch a romantic movie together. Need some movie ideas? Check out this Top 25 List of Romantic Favorites. Turn your living room into a ballroom. Move the furniture out of the way, turn on the music and dance like prom night all over again. Don’t know how to dance? Rent an instructional DVD from your local library and use the night to learn together! Read a book together. It could be something as romantic as a book on marriage or a silly as a favorite picture book from your childhood. Set the mood. Think candles. Think flowers. Think multiple-courses or fondue. What would you expect to see and taste at a fancy restaurant? Try to recreate that atmosphere around your own dining table. For extra gusto you may even want to dress up in your finest attire. Woowee! Revel in wedding day memories. This one will probably mean more to us girls than our hubbies but looking at old wedding albums or watching our wedding video is a great way to rekindle the fires. Enjoy hot chocolate/tea/coffee on the back porch together. There’s nothing like sitting together in the peace and enjoyment of God’s creation to build a deeper level of communication. Get your sport on. While it may not sound very romantic to start, playing soccer in the backyard or a round of H.O.R.S.E. in front of the basketball goal does wonders for relationships. Give each other a massage. Play a video game together. I remember when Goose and I used to do this when we were first married. We loved it. I think this may be one of our choices for Thursday, no doubt! Create a campfire in the backyard or light up the grill. Roast hot dogs, wrap up in a warm blanket and just enjoy watching the fire burn. Go star gazing. Put a blanket on the ground or wrap up in sleeping bags in your backyard and just enjoy gazing at the stars. Go back and read your journals, letters, and memos from when you were dating. Have a karaoke night. Get out your favorite romantic songs and have fun lip-syncing to each other. Have a Nerf gun war. I mean seriously, how fun would it be to sneak around the house in the dark (so as not to wake up the kids) and then shoot each other?! Ha! I may have to add this one too! Order in. Have pizza or Chinese delivered but be sure to use the chopsticks Have a spa night. Think bubble bath…foot massages…the works! Put a puzzle together, then glue and frame it.  Create sugar cookies. Bake them. Decorate them. And eat them. For an added Valentine’s Day flare you could even write your own little sweetheart messages on top and exchange them. Read Song of Solomon together. Write your lifelong bucket list together. Look through your old high school yearbooks or baby photo albums together. Get artistic. Try drawing or painting each other’s portraits and then framing them! Make a list of all the places you want to visit together were money no limit. Do Mad Libs together. Create a blueprint of your dream house. Have a staring contest. Sit on the couch, hold hands, and stare each other in the eye. The first one who looks away has to do whatever the other one asks of him or her! Have a dessert cook-off. Each of you find a new dessert recipe you’d like to try, bake them side-by-side in the kitchen, and then taste test them both to see which you like better! Write a gratitude list together. Make a list of everything you are thankful for as a couple and then tell God about it! Make a video for your kids telling them about how you met! Take your hubby on a love scavenger hunt. Play with your kid’s toys after they go to bed. Seriously, how long has it been since you’ve built a Lego castle? Have dinner on your roof. Talk about something you’d never forget. Make sure the roofline isn’t too steep though. Play 50 questions. Write out 25 questions each and then ask them to each other. Go window shopping together on Pinterest or Craigslist or some other favorite online shopping haunt. Use your children’s coloring books and crayons to have a coloring contest. Choose a new hobby to try out together. For added inspiration you can always check out the World’s Longest List of Hobbies. Make the date not about you. Make something to leave on a neighbor’s porch or choose a new Compassion child to sponsor together.  Want even more Valentine’s Day date night ideas?

       " \"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, “Don’t talk about guns.”  Colbert closed out The Late Show ’s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: “Doing nothing is cowardice.” he said. “You want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven’t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.”  Former 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:\",\n",

       " 'One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime\\'s take on everyone\\'s favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa\\'s wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn\\'t at Pippa\\'s wedding ceremony, either — but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all — where she met Harry\\'s parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister\\'s \"no ring, no bring\" policy — meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed — for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton\\'s longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie\\'s longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton\\'s May 2017 wedding despite the \"no ring no bring\" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister\\'s wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It\\'s also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry\\'s last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn\\'t have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn\\'t the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle\\'s black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle\\'s reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn\\'t seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle\\'s relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there\\'s more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle — in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place — which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa\\'s wedding — the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement — likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.',\n",

According to TMZ, which first broke the news, the incident, which the actor claims occurred last year, falls within the states statute of limitations and could therefore lead to a criminal investigation.  On Oct. 10, the 49-year-old “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star took to Twitter to detail an alleged incident where he was groped last year by a high-level Hollywood exec.  “This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD.

       " 'The royal descendants of Victoria (Queen of the United Kingdom) and of Christian IX (King of Denmark) currently occupy the thrones of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. At the outbreak of the First World War their grandchildren occupied the thrones of Denmark, Greece, Norway, Germany, Romania, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom. For this, Queen Victoria was nicknamed \"the grandmother of Europe\" while King Christian IX was nicknamed \"Father-in-law of Europe\". Of the remaining kingdoms of Europe today, only Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands descends neither from Queen Victoria nor King Christian IX.[1]  Grandchildren [ edit ]  Queen Victoria arranged the marriage of her eldest son and heir-apparent, the future Edward VII, to Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of King Christian IX, which took place on 10 March 1863. Among their six children were George V (who was also Emperor of India throughout his reign) and his sister Maud of Wales (who would later marry their cousin King Haakon VII of Norway, another grandchild of Christian IX, on 22 July 1896). However, these two marriages were not the only unions amongst and between descendants of Victoria and Christian IX.  The second son of Christian IX, Prince William, became King of Greece as George I shortly after his sister Alexandra\\'s marriage due to this new connection with the British Royal Family. On 27 October 1889 his son, later Constantine I of Greece, married Sophia of Prussia, a granddaughter of Victoria, forging another union between descendants of the British queen and the Danish king.  In 1865, Christian IX\\'s second daughter, Princess Dagmar, became engaged to Tsarevich Nicholas of Russia, son and heir of Tsar Alexander II. Following the untimely death of her fiancé, Dagmar married Nicholas\\'s younger brother, the Tsarevich Alexander in 1866, taking the Russian name Maria Feodorovna. Between 1881 and 1894, she was empress-consort of Russia. Her son, Nicholas II of Russia, married Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, yet another granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 26 November 1894, and she became empress-consort as Alexandra Feodorovna.  Other grandchildren became monarchs in their own right or consorts. Christian X of Denmark was the elder brother of Haakon VII of Norway and thus another grandson of Christian IX of Denmark. William II, German Emperor and King of Prussia was the elder brother of Sophia of Prussia and thus another reigning grandson of Victoria. Lastly, Victoria had two more granddaughters who became queens: Marie of Edinburgh, who married Ferdinand I of Romania, and Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg who married Alfonso XIII of Spain.  Christian IX was therefore the grandfather of an emperor and two kings who all married granddaughters of Victoria, one of whom (Maud of Wales) was also a granddaughter of Christian IX. In total, five of his grandsons were reigning sovereigns.  Victoria, meanwhile, was the grandmother of an emperor, a king-emperor, four queens consort and an empress consort.  First World War [ edit ]  During the First World War (1914–1918), many monarchs of countries from both sides were closely related due to their mutual descent from either Queen Victoria, King Christian IX or both. The most commonly cited example is the fact that Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom.[2][3][4] Other countries who fought against Germany in addition to Russia and the United Kingdom were Romania, whose queen-consort, Marie, wife of King Ferdinand I, was a cousin of the Kaiser, and Greece, whose queen-consort, Sophia, wife of King Constantine I, was the Kaiser\\'s own sister.  Additionally, King George V was a first cousin, through King Christian IX, of both Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and King Constantine I of Greece. Shortly before the end of the war, Nicholas, his wife and children were executed by the Bolsheviks. Other first cousins of George V, whose countries were neutral during the war, were King Christian X of Denmark, Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain (queen-consort of King Alfonso XIII) and King Haakon VII of Norway (who was also George\\'s brother-in-law via his marriage to George\\'s sister, Maud).  Family tree of sovereign and consort grandchildren [ edit ]  The family tree below also attempts to show the relationship between close and extended family members referenced on this page.  Present-day reigning descendants [ edit ]  The unions between descendants of Queen Victoria and of King Christian IX did not end with the First World War, despite the overthrows of both the German and Russian monarchies (along with House of Habsburg in Austria-Hungary). On the contrary, nearly all European reigning kings and queens today are most closely related through their descent from Victoria, Christian or both.  Currently, there are seven kingdoms remaining in Europe:[5]  1. Belgium: King Philippe & Queen Mathilde  2. Denmark: Queen Margrethe II  3. Norway: King Harald V & Queen Sonja  4. Spain: King Felipe VI & Queen Letizia  5. Sweden: King Carl XVI Gustaf & Queen Silvia  6. United Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh  7. Netherlands: King Willem-Alexander & Queen Máxima  King Harald V of Norway, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and King Felipe VI of Spain are all descended from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX. The first two monarchs are great-grandchildren of the aforementioned union between Alexandra of Denmark (daughter of King Christian IX) and Edward VII (son of Queen Victoria). Harald V of Norway is actually descended from Christian IX three ways, twice through his father and once through his mother. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and his wife Elizabeth II are second cousins once removed through Christian IX and also third cousins as they are both great-great-grandchildren of Victoria. Margrethe II of Denmark is descended once each from Victoria and Christian IX. She is also a first cousin to Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden through Victoria\\'s granddaughter Princess Margaret of Connaught. Felipe VI is descended from Victoria three ways and Christian IX twice. His father, King Juan Carlos I, is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX, while Juan Carlos\\' consort, Queen Sofía, is twice a descendant of Victoria and twice a great-great-granddaughter of Christian IX.  King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is descended from Victoria, twice, as his parents were second cousins because they were both great-grandchildren of Victoria. in addition, Carl XVI Gustaf also descends on his maternal side from Victoria\\'s half-sister Feodora. Although Carl XVI Gustaf is not a descendant of Christian IX; however, it should be noted that he descends on his maternal side from the parents of Christian IX through Christian IX\\'s elder brother, Friedrich.  Conversely, Philippe, King of the Belgians is descended from King Christian IX but not Queen Victoria, although, he is a descendant of Victoria\\'s maternal uncle (as well as her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\\'s paternal uncle), Leopold I, King of the Belgians. Philippe\\'s father, King Albert II, who abdicated in the summer of 2013, is a first cousin to Harald V of Norway through their grandfather Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, married to Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, a granddaughter of Christian IX.  In summation, the monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom as well as the consort of the United Kingdom are descended from both Victoria and Christian IX. The King of Sweden is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX (although from one of his brothers). The King of the Belgians and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg are descended from Christian IX and not Victoria, though they are descendants of both Victoria\\'s and her spouse\\'s uncle Leopold I of Belgium. The King of the Netherlands is the only monarch descended from neither Victoria nor Christian IX. (He is, however, a sixth cousin thrice removed of Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Harald V, Margrethe II and Carl XVI Gustaf through descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales; a sixth cousin four times removed of Felipe VI, also via descent from Frederick; and also a fourth cousin twice removed of Albert II through descent from William I of the Netherlands. Furthermore, William I of the Netherlands was also second cousin once removed to both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX, since he was the great-grandson of George II of Great Britain. Hence, all current reigning kings and queens in Europe, including the Netherlands, are related through the line of George II of Great Britain.)  Monarchs descended from Queen Victoria [ edit ]  Monarchs descended from King Christian IX [ edit ]  Notes  Common ancestry between Victoria and Christian IX [ edit ]  Because so many monarchs descend from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark, the relationship between these two monarchs is of some interest. These monarchs were third cousins through their mutual descent from King George II of Great Britain. This relationship occurs twice because the maternal grandparents of King Christian IX of Denmark, Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (1744–1836) and Princess Louise of Denmark (1750–1831), were both children of daughters of King George II of Great Britain (1660–1727), and thus first cousins. Louise of Hesse-Kassel, wife of King Christian IX of Denmark, was a granddaughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse (1747–1837), the brother of the aforementioned Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel.  Thus King Christian IX of Denmark and his wife Louise of Hesse-Kassel were second cousins to each other and third cousins to Queen Victoria.

With her expertise on the matter Saldana is back in the headlines for her assessment of how Hollywood treated Donald Trump’s presidential victory.  “We got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,” she explained during an interview with the AFP. “We were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong… and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises.”  While Saldana did not speak out in support of the president-elect’s highly criticized offensive behavior, her comments were perceived to have been in defense of Trump, and many Twitter users were not here for it.

Parks’ departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a “megawatt lie,” Parks said, “What more can I do? I apologized already and the person I’m most concerned about is Porsha. I’m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.”  A source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were “disastrous” for Parks. “It would be understandable if Phaedra didn’t come back, but it’s not finalized yet,” the source said. “It wouldn’t be Phaedra’s decision, but Bravo’s. It’s bad.” The insider added that that Parks’ actions were “incredibly painful and shocking.”  At the time, Parks’ rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as “untrue.”  Parks’ exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10.

Yesterday it was reported the famous couple were in contact with “a married African-American college graduate with two children” who would help bring their third child into the world.  Splash News 15 Kim Kardashian has broken her silence over reports she has chosen the woman she wants as her surrogate  But it seems Kim isn’t ready to discuss details yet, as she told E! News she would talk about her much-talked-about “third child” when she was ready.  Kim explained: “[There’s] so many details out there, and like I\\'ve never heard this, I\\'ve never heard this.  “Like whatever. We have not confirmed it, and that\\'s that. I\\'ll let you know when we\\'re ready.  “I\\'ve definitely seen a lot of things, we\\'ve never confirmed anything.”  Kim made the comments during a night out with her sister Kendall Jenner at the Harper\\'s BAZAAR event celebrating ICONS By Carine Roitfeld in New York.  Rumours surrounding Kim and Kanye deciding to expand their family have been circulating for months, after the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she would use a surrogate.  Splash News 15 The reality star and her husband Kanye West have been at the centre of numerous surrogacy reports over the past few weeks  Earlier this week it was revealed that the couple, who are already parents to North, four, and Saint, one, will be welcoming a baby girl in January.  According to TMZ, the pair decided to have a third baby via surrogacy because of Kim\\'s well-documented medical issues during her previous pregnancies.

In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians aired last year, the reality star was warned she could \"bleed to death\" if she falls pregnant for a third time.  Kim sought her doctor\\'s advice after admitting she wanted a third pregnant but fearing the same complications she endured in past pregnancies would return.  Getty - Contributor 15 Kim, pictured in 2015 while pregnant with Saint, has been warned she could \\'bleed to death\\' if she falls pregnant again  Doctor Crane warned her against it and said there is a \"potential fear\" for her after she suffered from toxaemia - toxins in the blood from infection - and had two \"very traumatic\" labours with North and Saint.  He said: \"Here\\'s what I think, your pregnancies, you had toxaemia, you had a retained placenta, very traumatic, we\\'re always worried about the next serious complication. I think the potential fear of the whole situation is legitimate.  \"You never know that you might not have the same type of problem that might be more serious this time. You\\'re always taking a little bit of a chance. There are situations where retained placenta could be life and death.\"  Her mother Kris, 61, then said: \"You could bleed to death\".  What is toxaemia of pregnancy? During Kim’s last two pregnancy she suffered from toxaemia – more commonly known as pre-eclampsia. It is a condition that can affect pregnant women, resulting in high blood pressure and damage to one or more organs, often the kidneys. It is usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy and can lead to serious complications for mother and baby. In Kim’s case she was warned that she could ‘bleed to death’ if she got pregnant again following complications the last two times.  Splash News 15 Kim suffered toxaemia during her pregnancies with North and Saint  Instagram 15 Kim confirmed in August that she and Kanye wanted a third child  Kim confirmed last month that she and Kanye were hopeful of a third child, but kept tight lipped about details or timing.  Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of a third child, she said: \"I hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We\\'re definitely trying. We are hoping so.\"  Getty - Contributor 15 Kim, seen while pregnant with Saint, hinted in August that she and Kanye were trying for a third child  Fame Flynet 15 The star has openly spoken about exploring surrogacy  Kim has spoken in the past about exploring surrogacy - and even said she\\'d asked sisters Kourtney and Khloe if they would be willing to carry her child.  Speaking during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she explained: \"I have had to go through multiple things to try and do it on my own but I do not think that is looking good for me but I am not giving up.  \"So it is a process. You kind of see the whole thing on this next season of our show... of me begging Khloe to help out, but I do not want to do that to her.  \"My mom offered, Kourtney offered.\"  BackGrid 15 Kim has asked her sisters if they would be surrogates for her and Kanye  EPA 15 The couple have been married since 2015  Kim’s troubles began when she was pregnant with her first child North after doctors discovered she had a high-risk condition called placenta accreta.  The rare condition occurs when the placenta attaches too deep into the uterine wall and is life-threatening because the sufferer can lose an average of three to five litres of blood during delivery.

       " 'Before he equivocated about a white supremacist murder, before he threatened war with North Korea, before he advocated a Muslim ban, before he drove a big truck, Donald Trump had more quotidian concerns bouncing back and forth across his tiny little brain. It was an apocalyptic year: 2012, end of the Mayan calendar and of the Twilight film franchise. Breaking Dawn — Part 2 hit theaters on November 16. Two days before, the future president of the United States tweeted this:  After Friday’s Twilight release, I hope Robert Pattinson will not be seen in public with Kristen–she will cheat on him again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2012  And four days before that, he tweeted this:  Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart…I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2012  Two weeks before that, he tweeted this:  Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don\\'t have time except to say \"Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012  And the day before that, he tweeted this:  Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012  Four days before that, he tweeted this:  Robert I\\'m getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I\\'m right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012  And this!  Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion. She will cheat again–100 certain–am I ever wrong? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2012  And the day before that, he tweeted this.  Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again–just watch. He can do much better! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2012  Thanks to the magic of social media and his own obsession with press coverage, the American people have access to a rich archive of our president’s unseemly fixations. Trump’s brief obsession with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ranks alongside his diatribe about his predecessor’s gum-chewing habit as the strangest of these. What drove him to tweet seven times about the breakup of America’s sweethearts? Why did he seem so desperate for Pattinson’s friendship? And what did the subjects of his sweaty speculation think of all this?  Until now, like the great philosophical inquiries, all of these questions were virtually unanswerable. Today, those of us who care about these things got some long-awaited insight into one of them, at least. That’s because a noble reporter at Entertainment Weekly had the good sense to ask Pattinson about it. Unfortunately, Pattinson’s answer wasn’t particularly revealing:  Does it seem somewhat surreal that the current president of the United States once wrote a bunch of tweets about you?  [Laughs] I think there’s so many different levels of it. Your identity exists on many different planes at the same time and they all can be quite different from each other. When he said that, it didn’t really mean anything. But I guess now I’m sort of thinking, like, “Well, I guess that is related to me.” But how does that fit in with all the other things going on in my life? And sometimes you think, “Can I use this in my acting? Or should I be putting it away.” It’s kind of interesting, I guess. I don’t know — this could be why people get annoyed with me.  Now all we need to do is pick the brain of MEAT BALL’S GHOST, the guy who used the RPatz/KStew tweets to predict Trump’s presidency.',\n",

Showrunner Ryan Murphy announced Tuesday that the Arrow and Teen Wolf alum — currently seen onscreen in Rough Night — has joined the seventh season of the FX anthology.

Better yet, the mag says they’re having a boy & a girl!  Ryan Gosling, 37, and Eva Mendes, 44, are reportedly preparing to welcome twins this year, according to OK! magazine. While the rumors have not been confirmed — HollywoodLife.com reached out to their reps for comment — the media outlet claims the actors are very excited about growing their family, and they’re going to be having both a girl and a boy! They allegedly struggled with IVF, but now that their alleged “miracle babies” are on the way, they could not be more thrilled.  “They are over the moon,” an OK! source told the mag. “And with the news that they’re having twins — a boy and a girl — it’s just heaven. They’re telling friends it’s the miracle they never expected.” Eva and Ryan are notoriously known for keeping their personal lives extremely private. In fact, Eva was able to keep her last pregnancy a secret up until weeks before she gave birth! So while there’s been no sign of a baby bump, OK!‘s source claims the couple celebrated their baby news on June 4 along with daughters Esmeralda, 3, and Amada, 2.  The family-of-four was photographed outside a restaurant, and Eva was reportedly “covered up” in a green sweater as she held Amada close. “They knew they may have some fertility issues given Eva’s age, but they didn’t realize just how difficult the IVF journey would be,” the insider shared. “Even when Eva wanted to give up, Ryan kept saying, ‘Just one more.’ That’s the one that took — and Eva’s been thanking him ever since.”  The two are SO excited in fact that they reportedly have already started discussing baby names. “They’re thinking Viviana for the girl and Carlos, after Eva’s brother who passed away,” the source said. “She’d like to honor his memory by naming her son after him, and Ryan is more than ok with that.” Only time will tell if Eva is actually pregnant!',\n",

       " 'Thank you! Oh, thank you all! Thank you so very, very much.It is wonderful to be here with all of you.To be in New York with my family, with so many friends, including many New Yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the Senate for eight years.To be right across the water from the headquarters of the United Nations, where I represented our country many times.To be here in this beautiful park dedicated to Franklin Roosevelt’s enduring vision of America, the nation we want to be.And in a place… with absolutely no ceilings.You know, President Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms are a testament to our nation’s unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad. His legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed. One is the man I served as Secretary of State, Barack Obama, and another is my husband, Bill Clinton.Two Democrats guided by the — Oh, that will make him so happy. They were and are two Democrats guided by the fundamental American belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all.President Roosevelt called on every American to do his or her part, and every American answered. He said there’s no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: “Equality of opportunity… Jobs for those who can work… Security for those who need it… The ending of special privilege for the few… The preservation of civil liberties for all… a wider and constantly rising standard of living.”That still sounds good to me.It’s America’s basic bargain. If you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead. And when everybody does their part, America gets ahead too.That bargain inspired generations of families, including my own.It’s what kept my grandfather going to work in the same Scranton lace mill every day for 50 years.It’s what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved, his small business printing drapery fabric in Chicago could provide us with a middle-class life. And it did.When President Clinton honored the bargain, we had the longest peacetime expansion in history, a balanced budget, and the first time in decades we all grew together, with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent.When President Obama honored the bargain, we pulled back from the brink of Depression, saved the auto industry, provided health care to 16 million working people, and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash.But, it’s not 1941, or 1993, or even 2009. We face new challenges in our economy and our democracy.We’re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises.Instead of an economy built by every American, for every American, we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules, their success would trickle down to everyone else.What happened?Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped. You know where we ended up.Except it wasn’t the end.As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning.You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs… you figured out how to make it work. And now people are beginning to think about their future again – going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement.So we’re standing again. But, we all know we’re not yet running the way America should.You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged.While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined. And, often paying a lower tax rate.So, you have to wonder: “When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead?”“When?”I say now.Prosperity can’t be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers.Democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations.Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too.You brought our country back.Now it’s time — your time to secure the gains and move ahead.And, you know what?America can’t succeed unless you succeed.That is why I am running for President of the United States.Here, on Roosevelt Island, I believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny. Each American and the country we cherish.I’m running to make our economy work for you and for every American.For the successful and the struggling.For the innovators and inventors.For those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases.For the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day.For the nurses who work the night shift.For the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us.For the veterans who served our country.For the small business owners who took a risk.For everyone who’s ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.I’m not running for some Americans, but for all Americans.Our country’s challenges didn’t begin with the Great Recession and they won’t end with the recovery.For decades, Americans have been buffeted by powerful currents.Advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports, but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of Americans.The financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value… too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks, too little on investments in new businesses, jobs, and fair compensation.Our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most Americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done. And they’ve lost trust in the ability of both government and Big Business to change course.Now, we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this, but the choices we’ve made as a nation, leaders and citizens alike, have also played a big role.Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that — to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.At our best, that’s what Americans do. We’re problem solvers, not deniers. We don’t hide from change, we harness it.But we can’t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before.Americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away.Now, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they’re all singing the same old song…A song called “Yesterday.”You know the one — all our troubles look as though they’re here to stay… and we need a place to hide away… They believe in yesterday.And you’re lucky I didn’t try singing that, too, I’ll tell you!These Republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse.We’ve heard this tune before. And we know how it turns out.Ask many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they’ll say: “I’m not a scientist.” Well, then, why don’t they start listening to those who are?They pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures. In a case that can only be considered mass amnesia.They want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million Americans without offering any credible alternative.They shame and blame women, rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions.They want to put immigrants, who work hard and pay taxes, at risk of deportation.And they turn their backs on gay people who love each other.Fundamentally, they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy. It takes an inclusive society. What I once called “a village” that has a place for everyone.Now, my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for America.I believe that success isn’t measured by how much the wealthiest Americans have, but by how many children climb out of poverty…How many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive…How many young people go to college without drowning in debt…How many people find a good job…How many families get ahead and stay ahead.I didn’t learn this from politics. I learned it from my own family.My mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion. She knew what it was like not to have either one.Her own parents abandoned her, and by 14 she was out on her own, working as a housemaid. Years later, when I was old enough to understand, I asked what kept her going.You know what her answer was? Something very simple: Kindness from someone who believed she mattered.The 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and, without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share.The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done. That was a bargain she leapt to accept.And, because some people believed in her, she believed in me.That’s why I believe with all my heart in America and in the potential of every American.To meet every challenge.To be resilient… no matter what the world throws at you.To solve the toughest problems.I believe we can do all these things because I’ve seen it happen.As a young girl, I signed up at my Methodist Church to babysit the children of Mexican farmworkers, while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends. And later, as a law student, I advocated for Congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities.My first job out of law school was for the Children’s Defense Fund. I walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn’t go to school, and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education.As a leader of the Legal Services Corporation, I defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer. And saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped.In Arkansas, I supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons, organized scholarships for single parents going to college, led efforts for better schools and health care, and personally knew the people whose lives were improved.As Senator, I had the honor of representing brave firefighters, police officers, EMTs, construction workers, and volunteers who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there, becoming sick themselves.It took years of effort, but Congress finally approved the health care they needed.There are so many faces and stories that I carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves.Just weeks ago, I met another person like that, a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college, while raising three kids.She doesn’t expect anything to come easy. But she did ask me: What more can be done so it isn’t quite so hard for families like hers?I want to be her champion and your champion.If you’ll give me the chance, I’ll wage and win Four Fights for you.The first is to make the economy work for everyday Americans, not just those at the top.To make the middle class mean something again, with rising incomes and broader horizons. And to give the poor a chance to work their way into it.The middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can’t have one without the other.Is this possible in today’s world?I believe it is or I wouldn’t be standing here.Do I think it will be easy? Of course not.But, here’s the good news: There are allies for change everywhere who know we can’t stand by while inequality increases, wages stagnate, and the promise of America dims. We should welcome the support of all Americans who want to go forward together with us.There are public officials who know Americans need a better deal.Business leaders who want higher pay for employees, equal pay for women and no discrimination against the LGBT community either.There are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing.There are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow’s economy. We need everyone to come to the table and work with us.In the coming weeks, I’ll propose specific policies to:Reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck – because that leads to higher growth for the economy, higher wages for workers, and yes, bigger profits, everybody will have a better time.I will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home, not quick trades or stashing profits overseas.I will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns.We will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief, cutting red tape, and making it easier to get a small business loan.We will restore America to the cutting edge of innovation, science, and research by increasing both public and private investments.And we will make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.Developing renewable power – wind, solar, advanced biofuels…Building cleaner power plants, smarter electric grids, greener buildings…Using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment…And ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to Indian country, from small towns in the Mississippi Delta to the Rio Grande Valley to our inner cities, we have to help our fellow Americans.Now, this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses, and enable America to lead the global fight against climate change.We will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses. Customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads, railways, bridges, airports, ports, and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century.We will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements.Now, building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset, our people, beginning with our youngest.That’s why I will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in America.And I want you to remember this, because to me, this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this. Research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success. In fact, 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three.One thing I’ve learned is that talent is universal – you can find it anywhere – but opportunity is not. Too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to.Our country won’t be competitive or fair if we don’t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life.So let’s staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world, and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child.Let’s make college affordable and available to all …and lift the crushing burden of student debt.Let’s provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires, setting up many more Americans for success.Now, the second fight is to strengthen America’s families, because when our families are strong, America is strong.And today’s families face new and unique pressures. Parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home.I believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days.I believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead.I believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence, not anxiety.That you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it, without breaking the bank.I believe we should offer paid family leave so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative.And it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color often making even less.This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s a family issue. Just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue. Expanding childcare is a family issue. Declining marriage rates is a family issue. The unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue. Helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue.In America, every family should feel like they belong.So we should offer hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship. Not second-class status.And, we should ban discrimination against LGBT Americans and their families so they can live, learn, marry, and work just like everybody else.You know, America’s diversity, our openness, our devotion to human rights and freedom is what’s drawn so many to our shores. What’s inspired people all over the world. I know. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.And these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before.So we have a third fight: to harness all of America’s power, smarts, and values to maintain our leadership for peace, security, and prosperity.No other country on Earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century. No other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran – and to deal with the rise of new powers like China.No other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks, transnational terror networks like ISIS, and diseases that spread across oceans and continents.As your President, I’ll do whatever it takes to keep Americans safe.And if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new World Trade Center soaring skyward.As a Senator from New York, I dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover. And as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to maintain the best-trained, best-equipped, strongest military, ready for today’s threats and tomorrow’s.And when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service, I’ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation, but the care and benefits they’ve earned.I’ve stood up to adversaries like Putin and reinforced allies like Israel. I was in the Situation Room on the day we got bin Laden.But, I know — I know we have to be smart as well as strong.Meeting today’s global challenges requires every element of America’s power, including skillful diplomacy, economic influence, and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people, not just their governments.There are a lot of trouble spots in the world, but there’s a lot of good news out there too.I believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them.And we all know that in order to be strong in the world, though, we first have to be strong at home. That’s why we have to win the fourth fight – reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday Americans.We have to stop the endless flow of secret, unaccountable money that is distorting our elections, corrupting our political process, and drowning out the voices of our people.We need Justices on the Supreme Court who will protect every citizen’s right to vote, rather than every corporation’s right to buy elections.If necessary, I will support a constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United.I want to make it easier for every citizen to vote. That’s why I’ve proposed universal, automatic registration and expanded early voting.I’ll fight back against Republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people, poor people, people with disabilities, and people of color.What part of democracy are they afraid of?No matter how easy we make it to vote, we still have to give Americans something worth voting for.Government is never going to have all the answers – but it has to be smarter, simpler, more efficient, and a better partner.That means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers, the American people.We need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services.There’s so much that works in America. For every problem we face, someone somewhere in America is solving it. Silicon Valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago. Many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services. I want to help Washington catch up.To do that, we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back, not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility.Now, I’ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike. But I’ll also stand my ground when I must.That’s something I did as Senator and Secretary of State — whether it was working with Republicans to expand health care for children and for our National Guard, or improve our foster care and adoption system, or pass a treaty to reduce the number of Russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities — and it’s something I will always do as your President.We Americans may differ, bicker, stumble, and fall; but we are at our best when we pick each other up, when we have each other’s back.Like any family, our American family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common, and fight back against those who would drive us apart.People all over the world have asked me: “How could you and President Obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign?”Now, that is an understandable question considering that in many places, if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled – even killed – not hired as Secretary of State.But President Obama asked me to serve, and I accepted because we both love our country. That’s how we do it in America.With that same spirit, together, we can win these four fights.We can build an economy where hard work is rewarded.We can strengthen our families.We can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world.And we can renew the promise of our democracy.If we all do our part. In our families, in our businesses, unions, houses of worship, schools, and, yes, in the voting booth.I want you to join me in this effort. Help me build this campaign and make it your own.Talk to your friends, your family, your neighbors.Text “JOIN” J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6.Go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to make calls and knock on doors.It’s no secret that we’re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for America. But I’ve spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I’m not stopping now.You know, I know how hard this job is. I’ve seen it up close and personal.All our Presidents come into office looking so vigorous. And then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer.Well, I may not be the youngest candidate in this race. But I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States!And the first grandmother as well.And one additional advantage: You’re won’t see my hair turn white in the White House. I’ve been coloring it for years!So I’m looking forward to a great debate among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I’m not running to be a President only for those Americans who already agree with me. I want to be a President for all Americans.And along the way, I’ll just let you in on this little secret. I won’t get everything right. Lord knows I’ve made my share of mistakes. Well, there’s no shortage of people pointing them out!And I certainly haven’t won every battle I’ve fought. But leadership means perseverance and hard choices. You have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it.I think you know by now that I’ve been called many things by many people — “quitter” is not one of them.Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother.When I was a girl, she never let me back down from any bully or barrier. In her later years, Mom lived with us, and she was still teaching me the same lessons. I’d come home from a hard day at the Senate or the State Department, sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook, and just let everything pour out. And she would remind me why we keep fighting, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.I can still hear her saying: “Life’s not about what happens to you, it’s about what you do with what happens to you – so get back out there.”She lived to be 92 years old, and I often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century — all the progress that was won because Americans refused to give up or back down.She was born on June 4, 1919 — before women in America had the right to vote. But on that very day, after years of struggle, Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment that would change that forever.The story of America is a story of hard-fought, hard-won progress. And it continues today. New chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us – not just some, but all – should have the chance to live up to our God-given potential.Not only because we’re a tolerant country, or a generous country, or a compassionate country, but because we’re a better, stronger, more prosperous country when we harness the talent, hard work, and ingenuity of every single American.I wish my mother could have been with us longer. I wish she could have seen Chelsea become a mother herself. I wish she could have met Charlotte.I wish she could have seen the America we’re going to build together.An America, where if you do your part, you reap the rewards.Where we don’t leave anyone out, or anyone behind.An America where a father can tell his daughter: yes, you can be anything you want to be. Even President of the United States.Thank you all. God bless you. And may God bless America.',\n",

       " 'Beckham allegations \\'deliberately inaccurate\\', says spokesman  2/4/17 Share Close  Newspaper allegations made against the ex-Man Utd star paint a \"deliberately inaccurate picture\" of the former England captain, a spokesman has said  A spokesperson for David Beckham has labelled newspaper allegations as being drawn from \"hacked and doctored private emails\" in order to give a \"deliberately inaccurate picture\" of the former England captain.  A report on Friday in The Sun, who claim the information was obtained by the European Investigative Collaborations network and then published across Europe, alleged Beckham carried out work for global children\\'s charity UNICEF as a means to gain favour under the UK honours system and reacted angrily when he was not granted a knighthood.  But a representative of the 41-year-old ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder insists the information published should be treated with due scepticism in light of how it was obtained and presented.  \"This story is based on outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server and gives a deliberately inaccurate picture,\" read a statement released to Omnisport.  Beckham: Man Utd almost sold be to Barcelona  \"David Beckham and UNICEF have had a powerful partnership in support of children for over 15 years. The David Beckham 7 Fund specifically has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable children around the world. David Beckham has given significant time and energy and has made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue long term.  \"Before establishing the 7 Fund, David had supported UNICEF and a number of other charities over many years, including donating his entire earnings from PSG during his time playing there.  \"David and UNICEF are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together and are happy to let the facts speak for themselves.”  UNICEF issued a release of their own, detailing and praising Beckham\\'s work for charity.  The statement read: \"UNICEF has become aware of media reports relating to 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund. Some reports relate to alleged private correspondence between our ambassador and other parties, which we have not seen and cannot comment upon.  \"David Beckham has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2005, and as well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for UNICEF’s work for children, David has given significant funds personally.  Beckham returns to Paris Saint-Germain  \"The 7 Fund supports programmes for children, tackling issues such as malnutrition, violence, AIDS and emergencies. For example, in June 2016 David visited Swaziland to raise awareness of the devastating drought affecting Eastern and Southern Africa, helping UNICEF reach people around the world with important messages about the need for urgent action.  \"UNICEF works closely with high profile personalities in good faith to fundraise, advocate and make long-term change for children in danger around the world. Our ambassadors support UNICEF in a voluntary capacity, receiving no fee for their time and commitment. They contribute greatly to UNICEF’s work for children.\"  \"We are extremely proud of the 7 Fund and all it has achieved for children. Since it launched in February 2015 it has raised millions of pounds for UNICEF programmes and reached millions of people around the world with crucial messages about our work for very vulnerable children.\"',\n",

Jessica Simpson, 36, had a little mishap leaving her husband Eric Johnson‘s 38th birthday party on September 19. The couple, who have been married for three years, were spotted leaving posh Los Angeles hotspot Craig’s in the wee hours of September 20 after what appeared to be an absolute banger of a bash. As paparazzi surrounded the couple, the fashion mogul had a bit of trouble getting around the cameramen. She missed a curb while wearing sky-high heels and nearly fell to the ground!  Good thing Eric was by her side and holding her hand! He caught her when she stumbled and saved the day, pulling her upright. Whew! She was totally fine, by the way. Eric clearly thought the whole thing was hilarious. He was cracking up after seeing the unintentionally goofy Jessica was pulling as she went down. You gotta admit — there’s nothing funnier than people tripping and falling. It’s just a fact of life.  Jessica was a good sport about the incident, too, sticking out her tongue at the paps as she hopped in her car. Take that! Eric’s definitely having the best birthday ever. At another birthday party for the athlete three days prior, Jessica got low while wearing a beer wench costume and totally flashed her butt to everyone at the beer garden. She was only wearing a black thong underneath the flouncy skirt. She captioned the pic “38 IS GREAT 🍻#IAMSOHOTFORYOU” on Instagram. Damn! Eric looked absolutely thrilled at the situation, stretching out his arms like her won a championship with a beer stein in each hand. Happy birthday, dude!

       " 'Emily Jean Stone (born November 6, 1988) is an American actress. The recipient of such accolades as an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe, she was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2017. She appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 in 2013 and the Time 100 in 2017, and has been cited in the media as one of the most talented actresses of her generation.  Born and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater production of The Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she made her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention for her role in Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone\\'s first starring role, earning her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the drama The Help (2011).  Stone gained wider recognition for playing Gwen Stacy in the 2012 superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man, and its sequel in 2014. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the role of a recovering drug addict in the black comedy-drama Birdman (2014). Her Broadway debut came in a revival of the musical Cabaret (2014–2015). Stone won an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing an aspiring actress in the highly successful musical film La La Land (2016), following which she portrayed Billie Jean King in the biographical sports film Battle of the Sexes (2017).  Early life  Emily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone (née Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company.[1][2] Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15.[3][4] She has a younger brother, Spencer.[5] Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to \"Stone\" when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island. She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[6]  As an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child.[7] Stone has described herself as having been \"loud\" and \"bossy\" while growing up.[8] She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that \"I made sure I got all As\".[9] Stone suffered panic attacks as a child,[10] which she says caused a decline in her social skills.[11] She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.[10]  The first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend\\'s house, and I thought the house was burning down. I called my mom and she brought me home, and for the next three years it just would not stop. I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands. I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be, then ask again 30 seconds later. I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change. Stone, The Wall Street Journal, June 2015[10]  Stone started acting at age four;[4] she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years.[12] Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage production of The Wind in the Willows, playing the part of Otter.[13] The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix\\'s Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat[1]—and performed with the theater\\'s improvisational comedy troupe.[14] Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon\\'s All That.[15] Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.[2]  Stone attended Xavier College Preparatory\\u200d—\\u200can all-girl Catholic high school\\u200d—\\u200cas a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress.[1] She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled \"Project Hollywood\" (featuring Madonna\\'s 2003 song \"Hollywood\") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career.[12] In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalls: \"I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom\", adding, \"I ended up getting none.\"[4] Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes, and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.[2][10]  Career  Early career (2004–2008)  When Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, the name \"Emily Stone\" was already taken. \"Riley Stone\" was the stage name she chose initially, but after guest-starring in the NBC drama Medium and the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, she decided that she was more comfortable with \"Emma\".[15][16] She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004). The resulting show, retitled The New Partridge Family (2004), remained an unsold pilot.[17] She followed this with a guest appearance in Louis C.K.\\'s HBO series Lucky Louie.[10] She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her \"rock bottom\" experience.[2] In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama Drive, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.[1]  Stone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola\\'s comedy Superbad (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill\\'s romantic interest, she dyed her hair red.[18] A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her \"appealing\", but felt that her role was poorly written.[19] Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as \"amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I\\'ve had since then\".[20] The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.[21][22]  The following year, Stone starred in the comedy The Rocker (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the \"straight face\" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role.[23] The actress, who describes herself as \"a big smiler and laugher\", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure.[24][25] Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success.[26] The film sees her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses\\' 1982 song \"I Know What Boys Like\".[27] Reviews for the film were generally negative,[28] though she was praised for her supporting role,[29] and TV Guide\\'s Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: \"She\\'s positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her.\"[30]  Breakthrough (2009–2011)  Zombieland world premiere in 2009 Stone at theworld premiere in 2009  Stone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters\\' Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Loosely based on Charles Dickens\\' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success.[31][32] Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer\\'s $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film Zombieland,[33] in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which Empire\\'s Chris Hewitt found to be \"somewhat underwritten\".[34] In a more positive review, the critic for The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"[T]he hugely promising Stone ... [is] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years.\"[35] Stone\\'s final release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney\\'s Paper Man, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.[36]  Stone provided the voice of an Australian Shepherd in Marmaduke (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey, which is based on Brad Anderson\\'s long-running comic strip of the same name.[37] Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in Easy A, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck.[38][39] Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne\\'s 1850 historical romance novel The Scarlet Letter, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script \"so different and unique from anything I\\'d read before\", saying that it was \"funny and sweet\". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition.[40] The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone\\'s performance was considered its prime asset.[41] Anna Smith of Time Out commented: \"Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth.\"[42] With a total box office of $75 million, the film was a commercial success.[43] Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.[44]  In October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC\\'s late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan.[45] Stone described it as \"the greatest week of my life\".[4][46] She hosted it again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015.[47] A brief appearance in the sex comedy Friends with Benefits (2011) reunited her with Gluck.[48] She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa\\'s romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film features her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling\\'s character. Despite finding \"some inevitable collapses into convention\" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone \"ties the whole film together\".[49] At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress – Comedy award for her performance in the film.[50] Crazy, Stupid, Love was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide with a production budget of $50 million.[51]  Disillusioned at being typecast as the \"sarcastic interest of the guy\", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor\\'s period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging.[52] The film is based on Kathryn Stockett\\'s 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: \"Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, \\'God! God! This is Skeeter.\"[53] She was cast as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film.[54] With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone\\'s most commercially successful film to that point.[55] The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics.[56] Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was \"well-meaning and hugely likable\" despite finding flaws in the character.[57] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,[58] and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.[59][60]  The Amazing Spider-Man, Birdman, and Broadway (2012–2015)  Stone declined a role in the action comedy film 21 Jump Street after signing on to Marc Webb\\'s 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of Sam Raimi\\'s Spider-Man series.[61][62] She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the title character (played by Andrew Garfield).[63] Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously.[64][65] She told The Vancouver Sun that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\",[66] adding that she was only familiar with Stacy\\'s character from Bryce Dallas Howard\\'s portrayal in Spider-Man 3.[67][68] The Amazing Spider-Man was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012 with global revenues of $757.9 million.[69] Entertainment Weekly\\'s Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone \"irresistible\",[70] and Ian Freer of Empire magazine was particularly impressed with Stone\\'s and Garfield\\'s performances.[71] At the annual People\\'s Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress.[72] Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, Sleeping Dogs, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.[73]  Stone began 2013 with a voice role in DreamWorks\\' The Croods, an animated feature nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[74] This followed with an appearance in Movie 43, an anthology film which consists of sixteen short stories—she played the title role in the segment entitled \"Veronica\".[75] The actress collaborated with Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer\\'s Gangster Squad (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s.[76] The New York Times\\' A. O. Scott dismissed the film as \"a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits\", but praised her pairing with Gosling.[77] Stone expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.[78]  Stone at WonderCon in 2012  In 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. In an interview with Total Film, the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film\\'s protagonist. \"She saves him more than he saves her. She\\'s incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He\\'s the muscle, she\\'s the brains.\"[79] Her performance was well received by critics;[80] an Empire reviewer praised her for standing out in the film: \"Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character.\"[81] The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids\\' Choice Awards.[82] Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen\\'s romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, a modest commercial success.[83] A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as \"the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect\".[84]  The black comedy-drama Birdman, from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone\\'s final film release in 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film features her in the role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter.[85] Birdman was critically acclaimed,[86] and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture.[87] The Movie Network considered it one of Stone\\'s best performances to date and Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was \"like a knitting needle to the gut\".[88][89] She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an Academy, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics\\' Choice Movie award for Best Supporting Actress.[90]  From November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical Cabaret as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams.[91] Considering it to be \"the most nerve-racking thing ever\", Stone told the Entertainment Weekly magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role.[92][93] Variety\\'s Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance \"a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy.\"[94] Both of Stone\\'s 2015 films\\u200d—\\u200cthe romantic comedy-drama Aloha, and the mystery drama Irrational Man\\u200d—\\u200cwere critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics.[83][95] In Cameron Crowe\\'s Aloha, she took on the role of an Asian-American air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in the Woody Allen-directed Irrational Man, she portrayed the romantic interest of Joaquin Phoenix\\'s character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood.[96] Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.[97]  La La Land and beyond (2016–present)  During her Cabaret show, Stone met director Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama La La Land.[98] The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, featured Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles.[99] Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[100][101] For the musical\\'s soundtrack, she recorded six songs.[a] La La Land served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and received highly positive reviews.[103] Besides being Stone\\'s highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes,[104] the film was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget.[105] Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw reviewed, \"Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears.\"[106] Stone received an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe and a SAG award for Best Actress.[107]  Stone\\'s sole film release of 2017 was the sports drama Battle of the Sexes, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell).[108] In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, trained with a dialect coach to speak in King\\'s accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg).[109][110] The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone\\'s performance to be the best of her career.[111] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian praised her for playing against type, and credited her for being \"strong\" and \"convincing\" in the part.[112] Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget.[113][114] Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.[115][116]  In September 2018, Stone will feature in and serve as an executive producer for the Netflix fantasy series Maniac, co-starring Jonah Hill and directed by Cary Fukunaga.[117] She will then star as Abigail Masham, who served under Queen Anne, in Yorgos Lanthimos\\' historical drama The Favourite.[118] Stone is also set to appear in the drama Love May Fail, based on Matthew Quick\\'s 2015 novel and will portray Cruella de Vil in a live-action spin-off of One Hundred and One Dalmatians.[119][120] In addition, Stone has committed to star in a sequel to Zombieland.[121]  Personal life  Stone moved from Los Angeles to Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2009.[12] In 2016, she moved back to Los Angeles.[10] Despite frequent media coverage, the actress has refused to speak about her private life. Concerned with living a \"normal\" life, she has said that she finds little value in media attention.[122] She has expressed her fondness for her profession,[10] and has cited actress Diane Keaton as an influence, who is (in Stone\\'s words) \"one of the most covered-up actresses of all time\". She has also named actress and singer-songwriter Marion Cotillard as one of her inspirations.[2]  Stone has a close relationship with her family.[2] She says: \"I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I\\'ve been really lucky in that sense.\"[123] During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield.[124] The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up. The couple refused to talk about it publicly, though they made several appearances together. In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.[125][126]  According to Stone, she suffers from asthma, which she discovered after having difficulty breathing while filming Easy A.[127] Her mother was diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer and was cured in 2008.[128] Stone and her mother celebrated by getting tattoos of birds\\' feet, designed by Paul McCartney, a reference to the Beatles\\' \"Blackbird\", which is a song she and her mother love.[129] She appeared in a Revlon campaign that promoted breast cancer awareness.[130] In 2011, the actress featured in a collaborative video between Star Wars and Stand Up to Cancer, which aimed to raise funds for cancer research.[131] Two years later, she attended an event by Gilda\\'s Club, an organization working for a similar purpose.[132] From 2012 to 2014, she hosted the Entertainment Industry Foundation\\'s Revlon Run/Walk, which helps fight women\\'s cancer.[133]  Stone, alongside three other celebrities, was present at the 2012 Nickelodeon HALO Awards, a television special that profiled five teenagers who are \"Helping And Leading Others\" (HALO).[134] In 2014, on an occasion in New York, Stone and Garfield encouraged paparazzi to visit websites, which spread awareness of causes, such as autism.[135] She attended the 2014 Earth Hour, a worldwide movement for the planet organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature.[136] In 2015, she was part of a fundraising event in support of the Motion Picture & Television Fund, which helps people in the television and film industry with limited or no resources.[137] In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time\\'s Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.[138]  Media image  Several media publications consider Stone one of her generation\\'s most talented actresses.[141][142][143] Commenting on her performance in The Help, Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter called her \"one of our very best young actresses\".[144] She is known for starring both in high-profile, mainstream productions and in low-budget independent films. Time\\'s Daniel D\\'Addario describes the latter as \"substantive risk\" and adds that taking on a role in them provides her an opportunity to \"try something new and to get credibility\".[145] Analyzing her on-screen persona, Jessica Kiang of Indiewire noted that Stone \"usually [plays] the approachable, down-to-earth, girl-next-door type, [and] in person she demonstrates many of those qualities too, along with an absolute refusal to take herself too seriously.\"[146]  As her career in Hollywood films has developed, Stone has become a successful and popular actress.[147] In 2008, she topped Saturday Night Magazine\\'s Top 20 Rising Stars Under 30 and was included in a similar list compiled by Moviefone.[148][149] LoveFilm placed her on their list of 2010 Top 20 Actresses Under 30, and her performance in Easy A was included in Time\\'s Top 10 Everything of 2010.[150][151] She appeared in the 2013 Celebrity 100, a compilation of the 100 most powerful people in the world, as selected annually by Forbes.

Chi-Town Flip, which follows husband-and-wife team Bryan and Maira Segal as they transform homes in the Windy City follows the same model as Tarek and Christina’s successful series, and will be the first launched by the production company the El Moussas formed last year, before they separated.  “We’ve been working together for a really long time, It’s our job. Obviously, we know each other really well,” says Tarek of the former couple’s dynamic as business partners. They’re co-executive producing the series, which he notes they began working on “before separation. So it’s been a long, long process.”  But they’re not simply seeing the project through before parting ways. Tarek tells PEOPLE exclusively, he’s not ruling out the possibility of working together again down the line. “It’s hard to say right now because we’re just letting the dust settle. But I’m always looking for growth, always looking into tomorrow,” he says. “The future is bright. We’ll see what happens,”  WATCH THIS: Christina and Tarek El Moussa’s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship  Christina and Tarek discovered their proteges at one of their real estate seminars, where Bryan, a former police officer, made sure to leave a lasting impression on the HGTV stars. “While we were doing pictures with all the students,” Tarek explains, “he comes up to me and shakes my hand and says, ‘You’re gonna know me.’ And I’m like, ‘Okay, nice to meet you,’ and he goes, ‘No,’ and he wouldn’t let go of my hand, ‘You are going to know me.’ I thought he was funny. Ten minutes later he comes back. He went back in line again to tell me, ‘You are gonna know me.'”  And he was right. The two connected after the seminar and became fast friends. “I definitely mentored Bryan quite a bit,” Tarek notes. “And it’s really worked out. He’s created a really successful business with his wife.” Bryan and Maira take on similar roles to Christina and Tarek, with the guys focussing on construction and the women designing to sell.  In the premiere alone, they face possible bullet holes in the windows, unsightly facades, and 100 years worth of potential damage — and that’s all before they step inside.  Check out the trailer above and watch the premiere of Chi-Town Flip August 6 at 2PM on HGTV.\",\n",
       " \"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

       " 'Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham —the now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written—it\\'s easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that\\'s the case. Let\\'s take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she\\'s listening to Cardi B \\'s \"Be Careful,\" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper\\'s recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fiancé Offset\\'s infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. \"Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,\" she raps, \"Man, I thought you would\\'ve learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin\\', but you out here chasin\\' culo/ And putas, chillin\\' poolside, livin\\' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it\\'s not a threat, it\\'s a warnin\\'.\" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: \"The queen.\"  What\\'s more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption \"Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,\" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption \"Chloe\\'s fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.\"  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn\\'t officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. “They were like, \\'That’s all great that you want to go away—but you can’t. You are your own person,\\'\" she said. \"\\'You’re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.’ I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren’t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.” With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.',\n",
       " 'The cover of Us Weekly this week features a Photoshopped composite of our pals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with an American flag floating just above Meghan’s head. “COMING TO AMERICA!” the cover line shouts (with the similarly all-caps question touted beneath: “BUT IS HER DAD ON THE LIST?”).  Yes, the magazine claims that, per a Palace insider, Harry and Meghan are in the midst of planning a U.S. tour in the spring of 2019 (their first full-scale overseas tour as a married couple is set for this October, when they will travel to Australia and New Zealand timed for the Invictus Games). “They are so excited to head to the U.S.” the insider told the magazine. “Meghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.” (Feel free to begin searching through the entries from the Tig you printed and arranged in a scrapbook to start deducing to which eateries and boutiques Meghan might introduce her husband.)  Us Weekly has additional posited details it is offering up, as well, claiming that the duo are “thinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,” though they are “working to finalize locations and venues.” In California, they will reportedly visit San Francisco, where “they will meet with C.E.O.s and female tech entrepreneurs to encourage their involvement in the industry.” (Perhaps Meghan can pitch some Silicon Valley types on a Tig-esque recommendations app; or Harry can offer some suggestions on . . . maybe a polo V.R. experience?) “Meghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,” the source says. “They want to highlight and foster these relationships.” There might be a Chicago component, as well, involving a stop at the Obama Foundation. While this is starting to sound like a quite sprawling tour already, there is also apparently talk of extending it to Canada, where Meghan lived (in Toronto) while she was filming Suits, for seven seasons.  The royal-related rumors—particularly Meghan-related ones—come fast and furious these days, so it’s hard to know exactly how seriously to take this report. A trip that involves stops in New York City, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and Canada, seems somewhat insane; on the other hand, they will surely visit the U.S. at some point soon, especially since Meghan is from here. (The publication notes that Meghan will be making an “unofficial” solo trip to New York and Los Angeles later this summer “to see family and friends.” We can only imagine what sort of comments Thomas Markle will be making if that trip does not involve a stop to see him.)  Vanity Fair has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report.',\n",
       " 'Amber Heard isn’t interested in giving her sexuality any kind of label.  When Allure Magazine asked the 31-year-old if she identified as bisexual, the actress responded, “I don’t identify as anything.”  “I’m a person,” explained Heard. “I like who I like. I happened to be dating a woman, and people started taking pictures of us walking to our car after dinner. I [was] holding her hand, and I realized that I have two options: I can let go of her hand and, when asked about it, I can say that my private life is my private life. Or I could not let go and own it.”  Heard, who previously married Johnny Depp, finalized her divorce from the actor earlier this year. But before her rocky marriage became highly publicized, Heard was dealing with a different kind of unwanted attention over her sexuality.  When she starred opposite Nicolas Cage in 2011’s “Drive Angry,” followed by “The Rum Diary” that same year with her ex, Heard claimed critics believed she was putting her career in jeopardy as the romantic lead.  “They pointed to no other working romantic lead, no other actress, that was out,” said Heard. “I didn’t come out. I was never in. It’s limiting, that LGBTQ thing. It served a function as an umbrella for marginalized people to whom rights were being denied, but it loses its efficacy because of the nuanced nature of humanity.  \"As we become more educated and expand the facts of our nature, we keep adding letters. It was a great shield, but now we’re stuck behind it. It’s so important to resist labels. I don’t care how many letters you add. At some point, it’s going to spell ‘WE ARE HUMAN.’”  These days, Heard is more interested in pushing for quality, especially within Hollywood.  “History tends to favor those on the right side of it,” said Heard. “Whether it’s civil rights in 1962 or suffrage in 1914 or gay rights in 2007. All of these debates seemed specific at the time, but if you pull back to the macro, there’s a trend: fairness. Justice is not as nuanced or delicate as it’s made out to be. And as the texture of our culture changes, [equality] will manifest differently in other debates.”',\n",
       " \"Jewellery stolen from Kim Kardashian after she was held at gunpoint during a raid in Paris could be funding terrorism, a new report has claimed.  The world's highest paid reality star was targeted at her exclusive apartment in the French capital during fashion week in October.  Thieves made off with her 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring worth £3.5million and a case of jewellery with a value of £5.24million.  Jewellery stolen from Kim Kardashian after she was held at gunpoint during a raid in Paris could be funding terrorism, a new report has claimed  The reality TV star was targeted at her apartment in Paris and armed thieves made off with her 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring worth £3.5million, pictured  Her hands and feet were bound with cable ties during the robbery and she is believed to have been dumped in her marble bath tub during the terrifying heist.  Nine men and a woman have since been arrest and charged with armed robbery, and are believed to be providing details of what happened to the jewels to police.  But now US gossip website RadarOnline has claimed that the missing jewellery has been linked to Islamic jihadists.  An unnamed source, who is described as a European official monitoring funding of terror groups, told the site the stolen items have been tracked to black market dealers in Belgium.  Nine men and a woman have since been caught and charged with armed robbery, and they are providing details of what happened to the jewels to police  He explained: 'There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups.'  However, fellow US gossip website Gossip Cop claims that sources close to the wife of rapper Kanye West say the allegations about terrorism are 'nuts'.  Kim's hands and feet were bound with cable ties during the robbery and she is believed to have been dumped in her marble bath tub during the terrifying heist in October  Their source said the 36-year-old has 'no knowledge' of her jewellery being linked to terrorism.  It comes after police sources in France, who are investigating the terrifying raid, admitted the cache of jewels stolen from Kim has almost certainly been melted down or re-cut and sold off.  An enquiry source told the BFM TV channel that Ms Kardashian ‘is unlikely to get them back’.  Jerome Guillochon, president of a French jewellers federation, told the news outlet: ‘They separate the stone from the metal.  ‘On one had, they will melt the metal, and on the other, they will usually cut the stones completely, in order to remove all markings or modify the shape.  ‘Because if there is a typical shape in exceptional jewellery, if there is a ring in the shape of a cushion, they can perhaps cut it in circles.’  Ms Kardashian’s ring had the name of the sports company Adidas carved into it, and was easily recognisable.  Mr Guillochon said technical equipment including lasers would have been used to alter the jewellery, and then it could have fetched millions on the black market.\",\n",
       " 'Olivia Munn has insisted she will continue to speak up for the #MeToo movement, even if it \\'costs her her career\\'.  The actress, 38, made the statement in an interview for Cosmopolitan\\'s December issue, as she called for a change in Hollywood to abolish the \\'unfair stigma\\' surrounding women.  It comes after she fought to have her former co-star Steven Wilder Striegel - a registered sex offender - removed from new movie The Predator and bravely spoke out about disgraced director Brett Ratner, accusing him of sexual harassment.  Speaking out: Olivia Munn, 38, has insisted she will continue to speak up for the #MeToo movement, even if it \\'costs her her career\\' in an interview for Cosmopolitan\\'s November issue  The #MeToo movement has garnered much attention since last year, after famed Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein was faced with multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.  Many of Hollywood\\'s leading ladies have come forward, recalling their own experience with sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace, as part of the wide-spread campaign across social media to raise awareness.  And having her say, Olivia has been vocal in her crusade to speak out against the unequal power at play in the movie industry.  She told the publication: \\'I\\'m not for sale... if speaking up costs me my career, I don\\'t want it anyway.\\'  Having her say: The actress has called for a change in Hollywood to abolish the \\'unfair stigma\\' surrounding women, after speaking out about the sexual harassment she has experienced  Olivia fought to have actor Striegel removed from movie The Predator after discovering he was a registered sex offender. Striegel spent six months in prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer.  He was accused of attempting to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship.  Striegel\\'s scenes from The Predator were removed, following pressure from Munn on Warner Bros bosses, and she claimed following the decision, director Shane Black - who had been a friend of Striegel - \\'has not spoken to her since\\'.  The victim of the actor has since publicly thanked Olivia for \\'standing up for her\\'.  She tweeted: \\'I am also eternally grateful for Olivia Munn’s action. She spoke up for me. She took a stance for me. In turn she stood for all who have suffered like I have.  Disgraced: Munn accused director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment following an incident that occurred on set of After the Sunset in 2004  Supporting women: Olivia also fought to have actor Striegel removed from movie The Predator after discovering he was a registered sex offender  \\'To be acknowledged by a stranger, on a public platform about this issue is incredibly empowering. The positive feedback from social media towards Olivia Munn is uplifting and feels incredibly supportive for me personally.  \\'I have no shame for what was done to me. I am not the one who needs to carry that shame. My name is Paige Carnes, former Jane Doe. I hope anyone who has suffered like I have regains their voice and their humanity.\\'  Olivia replied telling the girl she had been an \\'inspiration\\' and thanked her for her \\'courage\\' and \\'fearlessness\\'.  It hadn\\'t been the first time Olivia had taken a stance, as she previously accused director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment following an incident that occurred on set of After the Sunset in 2004.  Hitting back: Olivia told Cosmopolitan: \\'People want to think that women use their sexuality to get ahead in any business, not just Hollywood. There’s that unfair stigma\\'  She recalled how Ratner had masturbated in front of her when she was asked to deliver food to his trailer - penning about her experience in her 2010 book.  The director was faced with six allegations of sexual harassment and assault in November last year from different actresses. Ratner has denied all allegations against him and made a decision to step away from Warner Bros.  Speaking out publicly about the director, Olivia admits in her interview with Cosmopolitan that she was advised not to go up against Ratner, as she was told \\'his power trumped hers\\'.  Following her allegations against him, Ratner claimed he had \\'banged her three times\\' in a TV interview and branded Olivia \\'bitter\\' as he claimed the duo \\'used to date\\'.  Munn furiously denied his claims publicly on Twitter.  Fighting for her name: Olivia was forced to fight back following her claims against Ratner, as he appeared on TV and alleged he\\'d \\'banged her three times\\' - something she strongly denies  Standing up for herself: She took to Twitter to hit back at the disgraced director, telling Cosmo:\\'All I wanted was for him to clear my name. He muddied it and I wanted him to clear it\\' - Ratner later retracted his comments and confirmed they were not true  \\'He was doing this at a time when men were allowed to say that,\\' she says.  \\'People want to think that women use their sexuality to get ahead in any business, not just Hollywood. There’s that unfair stigma... All I wanted was for him to clear my name. He muddied it and I wanted him to clear it.  \\'I wasn’t looking for him to never work again, because back then it wasn’t even an option. I’d worked so hard and all I wanted was my name. So I went on to Twitter and I handled it in the only way I could. It was going to be a moral victory for me in that at least I’d stood up for myself.\\'  Ratner then backpedaled on his claims telling Howard Stern that he was just friends with the actress and apologised for making her look like \\'a whore\\'.  Ratner continued to work on films in the wake of the claims, with Munn speaking out once more against the director last year and claiming there has been \\'no justice\\'. She said she had been left pessimistic about Hollywood\\'s will to root out sexual misconduct, as a result.  Munn said: \\'There was always that feeling of, \"Do I have worth to the public, or to Hollywood?\" If I wanted to keep going, it felt like I had to bury it and just be OK with everything.\\'  In April this year, Warner Bros confirmed they will not be renewing their 450 million dollar deal with Ratner.  The studio’s deal with Ratner’s RatPac-Dune Entertainment financing company expired with the US release of Dwayne Johnson film, Rampage.  Olivia Munn\\'s full interview appears in the December 2018 issue of Cosmopolitan, on sale Wednesday.',\n",

Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!  HollywoodLifers, are you sad that Sophie isn’t in Australia with Joe?',\n",

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The singer, 31, shared the news on social media and wrote that she struggled to find the words to explain the disorder she had been “quietly treating” for the past five months.  “Wrote, deleted and re wrote this like 5 times…” Knowles wrote. “Still not sure what exactly or how much I want to share… However it’s so important to me for the people in South Africa, a place that has tremendous meaning to me and that has given me SO SO MUCH, to know why I won’t be performing at Afro Punk this NYE.”  She continued, “The past five months I have been quietly treating, and working through an autonomic disorder. [It’s] been a journey that hasn’t been easy on me… Sometimes I feel cool, and other times not so cool at all.”  Knowles explained that her diagnosis was “complicated” and that she is “still learning so much myself.”  “But right now, my doctors are not clearing me for such an extended lengthy flight, and doing a rigorous show right after,” she wrote.  While the singer did not share what type of autonomic disorder she was diagnosed with, people afflicted with it usually have trouble regulating their heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and body temperature as the disorder occurs in the nervous system, according to the Mayo Clinic.  RELATED VIDEO: Beyoncé & JAY-Z Take Snapshot in Elevator Years After the Infamous Incident  Knowles — who is mom to a 13-year-old son — also apologized to the fans who were excited to see her perform at Afropunk, promising that she would return to give them a show.  “I can’t put into words how saddened and sorry I am that I am unable to perform for you guys this NYE, there is simply no other place I wanted to be than there with my family to bring in 2018 with you…….but I give you my ABSOLUTE WORD I will come back with AfroPunk and deliver this performance…..as it is so extremely important to me to connect with the people who have so closely inspired me in so many ways,” she added.  Knowles revealed previous festivals had known about her health and kept it “confidential,” thanking them for their support and for keeping the news to themselves.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty  The younger sister of Beyoncé had canceled two shows this year, including one in November at Florida State University’s homecoming show which she said was due to a medical condition.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn\\'t a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry\\'s fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  \"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  \"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as \\'sisterly\\', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.

She used to practise announcing herself.\"  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  \"I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  \"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"  She added: \"I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry.

       " 'President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.',\n",

Rationing was still in place for myriad food items. In the streets, people queued for jobs, for handouts and for fresh fruit. Families torn apart by war tried desperately to rebuild, many without the men who had left home for battle and never returned. Access to fuel was limited. Then one of the coldest winters on record hit, destroying Britain’s wheat crop and leaving thousands of people in rural areas isolated.  When Princess Elizabeth’s engagement to Philip Mountbatten was announced that summer, many Brits welcomed the news. After so much suffering, the prospect of a royal wedding seemed to lift the nation’s spirit. “Oh, it gave us all a boost,” recalled Pat Bannell, a 97-year-old from East London. “We were all for it, especially if we got a day off work,” she said, chuckling.  The wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip came just four months after the engagement and was attended by 2,000 guests.  Across the country and around the world, people listened to the events unfold on the radio. Thousands gathered on the streets of London and outside Buckingham Palace, where they waited patiently for hours to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds after the nuptials. As the couple stepped out onto the balcony and waved, they were met with a roar of whistling, claps and cheers.  Describing the “vast crowds” and “shining happiness of the bride,” the Daily Telegraph reported the wedding would “live long in the memory.”  On Saturday, those long-ago newlyweds — the queen is now 92, Prince Philip is 96, and the couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in November — are expected to attend the royal wedding of their grandson Prince Harry to American actress Meghan Markle. (Prince Philip is recovering from a hip operation.)  [Britain’s black queen: Will Meghan Markle really be the first mixed-race royal?]  Planning any wedding is stressful — and mishaps are inevitable. Just ask Queen Elizabeth. On the morning of her wedding, the jewel-encrusted fringe tiara she was given as her “something borrowed” by her mother snapped as it was placed atop her head. The royal family, of course, had a jeweler on standby who was able to repair it and save the day.  Elizabeth’s wedding cake was nine-feet tall, and she received 10,000 telegrams of congratulations. The material for the wedding gown was purchased with ration coupons collected by the bride. Members of the public who wanted to help had sent their own coupons for the princess to use, although these were kindly returned to the senders.  Elizabeth’s dress was made from ivory silk and embellished with 10,000 pearls. But royal wedding dresses have not always been white. Before the 19th century, many royal brides opted for color, the bolder and brighter the better. When Queen Victoria wore a white ball gown to marry Prince Albert in 1840, she changed wedding traditions — royal and commoner — forever.

(Associated Press)  The demands of history always play a role in royal weddings. Not only do couples need consent from the queen to marry, they must also deal with an additional layer of pressure: to follow or jettison age-old traditions.  When the bride and groom exchange vows at Windsor Castle’s St. George’s Chapel this weekend, comparisons with the past will certainly be made. Kensington Palace announced this week that Markle’s father will not walk her down the aisle, as tradition demands. Instead she asked Prince Charles, her father-in-law, to perform the honor.  A statement from Ms. Meghan Markle: pic.twitter.com/TjBNarmuBU — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 17, 2018  Not having her father escort her isn’t without precedent. Queen Victoria was accompanied to the altar by her uncle. And Victoria walked her own daughter, Princess Beatrice, down the aisle in 1885.  On Saturday, smaller dramas will revolve around the royal couple’s decorative choices, sentimental touches and ceremonial decisions. All will be scrutinized. While many customs have prevailed throughout royal wedding history, others have been tweaked or replaced entirely.  The vows  When Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947, she took a traditional vow, promising to “love, cherish and obey” him.  It was Diana, Princess of Wales who broke with tradition in 1981 when she married Prince Charles by omitting the word obey. Diana instead promised to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her new husband.  Diana’s decision sparked controversy not just at home but also overseas. “LADY DIANA WON’T VOW TO OBEY CHARLES,” the New York Times wrote.    Princess Diana and Prince Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding on July 29, 1981. (AP Photo)  [Diana’s final hours: Dodi’s yacht, a Ritz suite, a diamond ring and relentless photographers]  Royal brides who came after Diana did not follow suit. When Sarah Ferguson married Prince Andrew in 1986, she vowed to obey, as did Sophie Rhys-Jones during her wedding to Prince Edward. (Bishop of Norwich Peter Nott, who led the wedding service, said use of the word ‘obey’ was about trust and did not mean Sophie was going to be “subservient.”)  In the run-up to Kate Middleton’s wedding to Prince William in 2011, speculation was rife about the impending vows. Would Kate do a Diana? The answer was yes. Standing in Westminster Abbey, she vowed to “love, comfort, honor and keep” her husband, with no mention of obeying him.  Now it is Meghan Markle’s turn to decide.  Flowers  When it comes to flowers and royal weddings, arrangements are traditionally all white — although size and style have varied dramatically over time.  Kate’s bouquet was described as simple by some and underwhelming by others. Diana’s bridal arrangement was quite the opposite, weighing in at more than four pounds. The bouquet was ostentatious, and she did not just have one, she had two. This is rumored to be because Elizabeth’s was allegedly misplaced by a footman and went missing at some point during her wedding day — much to the dismay of the official photographer. When it came time to take the family photo, her arrangement was nowhere to be seen.    Elizabeth’s bouquet was missing in this family portrait. (Associated Press)  Despite the differences in size, flower selection and personal preference, the inclusion of myrtle, which symbolizes love, is a tradition that dates back to the wedding of Queen Victoria’s daughter and is expected to continue with Meghan this weekend, although many anticipate she will add her own touch to the creation.  Wedding rings    Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon with Britain’s Duke of York, who became King George VI, on April 26,1923. (Associated Press)  At the time of her marriage to the future King George VI in 1923, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later known as the Queen Mother, opted for a wedding ring made from rare Welsh gold. From this date on, the Welsh wedding band became somewhat of a statement. Since then, the unique gold has been used to form the rings of the queen, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana. The wedding rings are formed from the same nugget, carefully extracted from the Clogau St. David’s gold mine in Wales. After his engagement, Prince William was given Welsh gold by the queen so Kate could wear a Welsh band.  Prince Harry recently said yellow gold is Meghan’s favorite, but it is not yet known whether her choice of wedding ring will follow royal tradition.  The date  Royal weddings often occur during the week, which, in the past has resulted in a day off for most workers. Queen Elizabeth and Philip were married on a Thursday. Prince Charles and Princess Diana on a Wednesday. Prince William and Catherine married on a Friday, and pubs and bars across the country had their opening hours extended to make room for extra drinking time.  Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tying the knot on a Saturday, but it is also one of the biggest soccer matches of the year, the FA Cup final. For FA President Prince William, who is also Harry’s best man, it is shaping up to be quite the day.

       " 'The pair were constantly bickering on Twitter  Katy Perry has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.  The pair fell out in 2011 when Harris was booked as the opening act for the singer’s tour but he pulled out at the last minute over issues with set production.  At the time Perry wrote: ”Calvin Harris will NOT be joining in on the fun and has CANCELLED last minute,” while Calvin hit back saying: ”Sorry to all who wanted to see me with Katy – her team suddenly moved the goalposts and I was to appear on stage with no production.”  However, Perry hit back, saying: ”The goalpost seems to be perfectly fine for New Young Pony Club, Yelle, Robyn, Marina & The Diamonds, to name a few. It’s fine, I’m used to you cancelling on me, it’s become ur staple! (sic).”  And Harris also dragged her into his public feud with Taylor Swift, after she started dating Tom Hiddleston and it was revealed that she had written the lyrics for his Rihanna collaboration ‘This Is What You Came For’.  He wrote at the time: ”I figure if you’re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.  ”I know you’re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I’m not that guy, sorry. I won’t allow it (sic).”  Perry said they hadn’t spoken since but has now revealed when they met at the Vanity Fair Oscars party this year, they decided to forget about the past and Harris asked her to collaborate on new song ‘Feels’, which appeared on his recent album ‘Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1’.  She told ‘On Air With Ryan Seacrest’, Katy said: ”We’d had little falling outs here and there. We’d had some public Twitter spats … Time to put all that behind us.  ”We just bumped into each other and he said, ‘I think I have a song that you should come check out’. I was like ‘cool’ because we had always meant to work together for years and years and years. I came to the studio and he played me a bunch of unfinished but really solid moments for his new record.  ”Then he played me this one part for this new song called ‘Feels’ and I was like, ‘Oh yeah’. This is like my favourite song off the record. I was just down to do it. I’ve always wanted to collaborate with him for years and years and years.”  Meanwhile, Perry recently revealed that she has delayed the start of her ‘Witness‘ world tour.',\n",
       " 'Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think?

       " 'Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, “Red Hen” owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to “problematic” ideas. Of course, they’re quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders’ family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she’s also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson’s bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson’s resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.“Considering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,” Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration’s actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining “unaffiliated” as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who’d never stepped through their door.“Kindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,” said a post on the family-owned restaurant’s Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location’s rating has plummetted from “4.8 stars to three-point-something.” An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has “absolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.”Wilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn’t enjoy “confrontation” but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.“I’m not a huge fan of confrontation,” Wilkinson told The Post. “I have a business, and I want the business to thrive.” But, she went on to say, “This feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.”When the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are “Nazis,” they incite hatred and violence in those prone to carry out such extremist beliefs. If conservatives are indeed Nazis, progressives have a moral obligation to not only oppose them but physically stop them.However, conservatives are not Nazis. In fact, the right has consistently stood up for the liberties of all, including far-leftists, to express their beliefs in a peaceful and unhindered manner. Such is the opposite of Nazism. In fact, it is those screaming “Nazi!” who are acting as the new Third Reich, shouting ideological chants, forcing out those with whom they disagree, discriminating against certain demographics, attempting to take away our Constitutional rights, and inciting physical violence.Stephanie Wilkinson is getting exactly what she has demanded — a backlash from the political opposition. Turnabout is fair play. While conservatives aren’t going to wield the government as a weapon to force intolerant ideologues like her to serve those they don’t want to serve, as the left does, they’re learning that injecting their political views into their non-political professions might not be the best business decision.',\n",
       " 'Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church.  Last night saw Bieber cancel his world ‘Purpose’ tour, months before it was due to end – citing claiming to be ‘burned out’ and exhausted from the months on the road.  Now, sources claim that Bieber may be turning his attention to ‘reconnecting with his faith’ and starting up his own church.  “I am led to believe that the real reason he has come off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith and he may be even planning to start his own church,” celebrity journalist Richard Wilkins told Today Extra – after speaking to sources close to him at the annual Hillsong Church Conference in Sydney.  “We know that he was in the country a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. [He’s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he’s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own – starting his own church – we’re not quite sure, but that’s the word from an inside source.”  Apologising to his fans via TMZ for cancelling his upcoming shows, Bieber said: “I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome.

       " 'Leah Remini (Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)  About 2.1 million people tuned in Tuesday night to the premiere of A&E’s “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,” Remini’s eight-episode docuseries that promises a deep dive into “shocking stories of abuse, heartbreak and harassment” within the Church of Scientology. Network executives say it’s the channel’s most-watched premiere in two years.  A solid number for the show isn’t surprising — Scientology is one of those topics that’s irresistible, mostly because of the secretive nature of the famously controversial church. Remini, known for the hit sitcom “King of Queens,” was a devout Scientologist for 35 years before she left the church in 2013. She has been an outspoken critic ever since, although it is extremely rare for anyone to criticize Scientology after they leave. Here’s her history of calling out the church:  [How Leah Remini is trying to expose Scientology secrets in her new docuseries]  (For the record, the church has called Remini an “obnoxious, spiteful ex-Scientologist” and claims the actress is bitter that she was expelled for unethical conduct; it also disputes many statements made in the A&E show. Church officials say that Remini is trying to “distort the truth” about Scientology and that she’s “doing [the show] for the money and now tries to pretend otherwise.”)  Leah Remini, the actress best known for hit CBS sitcom \"King of Queens,\" produced a documentary series about the Church of Scientology. (A&E)  July 2013: Page Six confirms that Remini, who rose to very high levels in the organization once she became a star and donated millions, has left Scientology. A Remini “source” says the actress was “put through interrogations and blacklisted within the church” when she started to question leader David Miscavige, particularly the whereabouts of his wife, Shelly, who reportedly hasn’t been seen in public since 2007.  Remini said she also disagreed with the church’s policies that restrict members from talking to relatives who criticize the church, a practice known as “disconnecting.” “She is stepping back from a regime she thinks is corrupt. She thinks no religion should tear apart a family or abuse someone under the umbrella of ‘religion,’ ” the source says.  Later that month, Remini echoes this sentiment to People magazine. “I believe that people should be able to question things. I believe that people should value family, and value friendships, and hold those things sacrosanct,” she says. “That for me, that’s what I’m about. It wouldn’t matter what it was, simply because no one is going to tell me how I need to think, no one is going to tell me who I can, and cannot, talk to.”  August 2013: Remini files a missing-person report for Shelly Miscavige, which the Los Angeles Police Department calls “unfounded.” The church says it’s “ill-advised, ludicrous self-promotion” on Remini’s part.  September 2013: Remini joins the cast of “Dancing With the Stars,” where she lands in fifth place. During one episode, she tells her partner, Tony Dovolani, that she hoped the show would help her move on. “The church is looking for me to fail so they can say to their parishioners, ‘You see what happens when you leave the church?’ They’re waiting for me to fail,” Remini says.  February 2014: Remini tells Buzzfeed that she quit Scientology because her young daughter was getting closer to the age of getting “acclimated” in it and would have to sit for audits, where members divulge personal information. Plus, Remini thought Scientology was taking over her life. “I was spending most of my time at the Church,” she says. “So, I was saying ‘family first,’ but I wasn’t showing that. I didn’t like the message that sent my daughter.” (Scientology officials call Remini’s statements “absurd, insulting and motivated entirely by a desire to grab attention.”)  Scientology\\'s famous members and secretive beliefs endlessly intrigue popular culture. Here\\'s a look at some of television\\'s best commentary on the religion. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)  March 2015: Alex Gibney’s “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” documentary airs on HBO, featuring multiple ex-members telling horror stories about their time in the organization. Remini tweets her praise: “Thank you to the brave who did something about it. And to those who didn’t have a voice, you do now.”  May 2015: Remini sits for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in “Oprah: Where Are They Now?” and talks about how painful it was to leave friends behind in the church. “I’m learning there’s a new world out here and there shouldn’t be any kind of judgment toward somebody who has a belief system that is not yours,” she says.  July 2015: The second and final season of her TLC reality show, “Leah Remini: It’s All Relative,” premieres, and Remini talks more about how she left to protect her daughter.  October 2015: Remini writes a book, “Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology,” and promotes it with an in-depth interview on “20/20,” reiterating her previous claims and saying she didn’t want want to be “disconnected” from her daughter.  November 2015: Remini’s book is released, and she spills lots of dirt, including tales of Scientology superstar Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’s wedding weekend, which is where her relationship with the church started to go downhill after Remini was accused of behaving badly. The church’s response? Remini is “pathetically exploiting her former religion, her former friends and other celebrities for money and attention to appear relevant again.”  December 2015: According to her show on A&E, Remini starts to get lots of requests for help from people who still have family members in the church. She captures one story on video of a family torn apart by Scientology, and decides to develop a show.  November 2016: “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath” premieres on A&E, chronicling Remini’s past and the stories of former members, who allege physical and sexual abuse. (Scientology officials say all of them are lying.)  “I want to give a voice to these stories,” Remini says in the show, “enough that people will be incensed by it to put some pressure on this organization to stop abusing people.”  Read more:  How Scientology controls John Travolta and Tom Cruise, according to ‘Going Clear’  Leah Remini talks about why she left Scientology  Katie Holmes says so much about Scientology without saying anything at all in ‘The Giver’',\n",

       " 'Rumors have been swirling about the reasons behind the breakup of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. And it has finally been revealed that the actual cause behind their recent split was that Selena decided to choose ‘happiness’ over Justin!  J-Beebs and Selena’s romance has been the most tumultuous one in the celebrity world. They broke up and got back together so many times that even the Jelena shippers have lost count.  Over the series of their breakups, both the stars handled their split very differently. And it’s a known fact that no matter who decides to break up, both the partners involved in a relationship feel terrible when things end between them. Having said that, one of the two always seems to be doing a little better than the other. And this time around, it seems as if Selena is trying to focus on the good instead of the bad.  A source close to the 25-year-old singer, Gomez, revealed to Us Weekly that she is ‘thrilled about her decision making process’.  While further elaborating, the source said, “Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends’ approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.”  The source continued, “She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family, and is so thrill about her decision-making process. She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”  While talking about the Bad Liar singer’s sentiments on the same issue, the source said that Sel feels like she ‘got it out of her system’. And instead of ruminating over the breakup and holding on to the negative feelings, she has more ‘exciting’ things to look forward to – like her recent single, ‘Back 2 You’.  It has also been revealed by a source close to the family that the rift in the couple has majorly been caused due to Selena’s mother.  The source said, “Selena and Justin decided to take a break mainly because of Selena’s mom and her disapproval of Justin.”  “Justin’s family loves Selena, but Selena’s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don’t trust Justin. Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed… but her family isn’t budging right now,” the insider concluded.  Justin and Selena’s breakup has started to look more like a permanent one, and reality has finally started to sink in with the Jelena fans!',\n",

       " 'Hugh Marston Hefner (April 9, 1926 – September 27, 2017) was an American magazine publisher and life-stylist. He was founder and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine, a revolutionary publication, aimed at a sophisticated young readership, with revealing glamour photographs and sensational articles provoking charges of obscenity. The first issue, in 1953, featuring Marilyn Monroe in her nude calendar shoot, sold over 50,000 copies.  Hefner extended the brand into a world network of Playboy Clubs, as well as his own luxury mansions where the Playboy ‘playmates’ shared his wild partying life, keenly reported in the media. An advocate of sexual liberation and freedom of expression, Hefner was a political activist in other causes too, including the Democratic party, First Amendment rights, animal rescue, and the restoration of the Hollywood Sign.  Early life [ edit ]  Hefner was born in Chicago on April 9, 1926,[2] the first child of Grace Caroline (née Swanson; 1895–1997) who worked as a teacher, and Glenn Lucius Hefner (1896–1976), an accountant. His parents were originally from Nebraska.[3][4] He had a younger brother, Keith (1929–2016).[5][6][7] His mother was of Swedish descent, and his father had German and English ancestry.[8][9]  Through his father\\'s line, Hefner claimed descent from Plymouth governor William Bradford.[10][11] He described his family as \"conservative, Midwestern, [and] Methodist\".[12] His mother had wanted him to become a missionary.[13]  He attended Sayre Elementary School and Steinmetz High School, then served from 1944 to 1946 as a U.S. Army writer for a military newspaper. Hefner graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a double minor in Creative Writing and Art, having earned his degree in two and a half years. After graduation, he took a semester of graduate courses in Sociology at Northwestern University, but dropped out soon after.[14]  Career [ edit ]  In January 1952, Hefner left his job as a copywriter for Esquire after he was denied a $5 raise. In 1953, he took out a mortgage, generating a bank loan of $600, and raised $8,000 from 45 investors, including $1,000 from his mother (\"Not because she believed in the venture,\" he told E! in 2006, \"but because she believed in her son.\"), to launch Playboy, which was initially going to be called Stag Party. The first issue, published in December 1953, featured Marilyn Monroe from her 1949 nude calendar shoot and sold over 50,000 copies.[15] (Hefner, who never met Monroe, bought the crypt next to hers at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in 1992 for $75,000.[16][17])  After the Charles Beaumont science fiction short story \"The Crooked Man\" was rejected by Esquire magazine in 1955, Hefner agreed to publish the story in Playboy. The story highlighted straight men being persecuted in a world where homosexuality was the norm. After the magazine received angry letters, Hefner wrote a response to criticism where he said, \"If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too.\"[18] In 1961, Hefner watched Dick Gregory perform at the Herman Roberts Show Bar in Chicago. Based on that performance, Hefner hired Gregory to work at the Chicago Playboy Club; Gregory attributed the subsequent launch of his career to that night.[19] In 1959, Hefner reinvented himself and bought a Chicago mansion in December of that year, a move which brought Playboy into the public eye.[citation needed]  On June 4, 1963, Hefner was arrested for promoting obscene literature after he published an issue of Playboy that featured nude shots of Jayne Mansfield in bed with a man present.[20] The case went to trial and resulted in a hung jury.[21]  In the 1960s, \"private key\" clubs would be created by Hefner, and these clubs would be racially diverse, in a time where the scent of segregation was still lingering heavy in the air.[22] Also during the civil rights movement in 1966, Hefner sent Alex Haley to interview George Lincoln Rockwell, much to Rockwell\\'s surprise because Haley was black. Rockwell had founded the American Nazi Party and would be later described by some as the \"American Hitler\". Rockwell agreed to meet with Haley only after gaining assurance from the Playboy writer that he was not Jewish, although Rockwell kept a handgun on the table throughout the interview. The interview was recreated in Roots: The Next Generations in 1979, with James Earl Jones as Haley and Marlon Brando as Rockwell; Brando won a Primetime Emmy Award for his portrayal of Rockwell.[23] Haley had also interviewed Malcolm X in 1963 and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1966 for the newly established 1962 \"playboy interview\"; all three interviewees would be assassinated by 1968.[24]  Hefner with his trademark Playboy Pipe in 1966  In 1970, Hugh Hefner stated that \"militant feminists\" are \"unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society that Playboy promotes\" and ordered a hit piece in his magazine against them.[25]  In the 1993 The Simpsons episode \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\", Hefner guest-voiced himself.[26][27] In 1999, Hefner financed the Clara Bow documentary, Discovering the It Girl. \"Nobody has what Clara had. She defined an era and made her mark on the nation,\" he stated.[28] Hefner guest-starred as himself in the 2000 Sex and the City episode \"Sex and Another City\".[29] In 2005, Hefner guest-starred on the HBO TV shows Curb Your Enthusiasm and Entourage.[29] Hefner guest-starred as himself in a 2006 episode of Seth Green\\'s Robot Chicken on the late-night programming block Adult Swim.[27] In the 2007 Family Guy episode \"Airport \\'07\", Hefner guest-voiced himself.[29] He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for television and made several movie appearances as himself on the small screen. In 2009, he received a \"worst supporting actor\" nomination for a Razzie award for his performance as himself in Miss March. On his official Twitter account he joked about this nomination: \"Maybe I didn\\'t understand the character.\"[30]  A documentary by Brigitte Berman, Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and Rebel, was released on July 30, 2010. He had previously granted full access to documentary filmmaker and television producer Kevin Burns for the A&E Biography special Hugh Hefner: American Playboy in 1996.[31] Hefner and Burns later collaborated on numerous other television projects, most notably on The Girls Next Door, a reality series that ran for six seasons (2005–2009) and 90 episodes.[32]  In 2012, Hefner announced that his youngest son, Cooper, would likely succeed him as the public face of Playboy.[33]  Personal life [ edit ]  Known to friends and family as simply \"Hef,\"[34] in 1949, Hefner married Northwestern University student Mildred (\"Millie\") Williams. They had two children: daughter Christie (b. 1952) and son David (b. 1955).[35] Before the wedding, Mildred confessed that she had an affair while he was away in the army. He called the admission \"the most devastating moment of my life.\" A 2006 E! True Hollywood Story profile of Hefner revealed that Mildred allowed him to have sex with other women, out of guilt for her own infidelity and in the hope that it would preserve their marriage. The two were divorced in 1959.[36][37]  Hefner remade himself as a bon vivant and man about town, a lifestyle he promoted in his magazine and two TV shows he hosted, Playboy\\'s Penthouse (1959–1960) and Playboy After Dark (1969–1970).[38] He was also the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, which is the publishing group that operates the magazine.[39] He admitted to being \"\\'involved\\' with maybe eleven out of twelve months\\' worth of Playmates\" during some of these years.[40] Donna Michelle, Marilyn Cole, Lillian Müller, Shannon Tweed, Barbi Benton, Karen Christy, Sondra Theodore, and Carrie Leigh – who filed a $35 million palimony suit against him – were a few of his many lovers. In 1971, he acknowledged that he experimented in bisexuality.[41] Also in 1971, Hefner established a second residence in Los Angeles with the acquisition of Playboy Mansion West and, in 1975, moved there permanently from Chicago.[42]  In 1985, Hefner had a minor stroke at age 59. After re-evaluating his lifestyle, he made several changes. The wild, all-night parties were toned down significantly and in 1988, daughter Christie took over the operation of the Playboy empire. The following year, he married Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad; they were 36 years apart in age. The couple had two sons: Marston Glenn (born 1990) and Cooper Hefner (born 1991).[43] The E! True Hollywood Story profile noted that the notorious Playboy Mansion had been transformed into a family-friendly homestead. After he and Conrad separated in 1998, she moved into a house next door to the mansion.[44]  Hefner became known for moving an ever-changing coterie of young women into the Playboy Mansion, including twins Sandy and Mandy Bentley. He dated as many as seven women concurrently. He also dated Brande Roderick, Izabella St. James, Tina Marie Jordan, Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt, and Kendra Wilkinson. Madison, Wilkinson, and Marquardt appeared on The Girls Next Door depicting their lives at the Playboy Mansion.[45] In October 2008, all three girls decided to leave the mansion. After an 11-year separation, Hefner filed for divorce from Conrad citing irreconcilable differences.[46] Hefner has stated that he only remained nominally married to her for the sake of his children,[47] and his youngest child had just turned 18.[43]  In January 2009, Hefner began a relationship with Crystal Harris;[48] she joined the Shannon Twins after his previous \"number one girlfriend\", Holly Madison, had ended their seven-year relationship.[49] On December 24, 2010, he became engaged to Harris, to become his third wife.[50] Harris broke off their engagement on June 14, 2011, five days before their planned wedding.[51] In anticipation of the wedding, the July issue of Playboy, which reached store shelves and customer\\'s homes within days of the wedding date, featured Harris on the cover and in a photo spread as well. The headline on the cover read \"Introducing America\\'s Princess, Mrs. Crystal Hefner\".[52] Hefner and Harris subsequently reconciled and married on December 31, 2012.[53][54][55][56]  Hefner\\'s brother Keith died at the age of 87 on April 8, 2016, one day before Hefner\\'s 90th birthday.[57]  Playboy Mansion [ edit ]  In January 2016, the Playboy Mansion was put on the market for $200 million, on condition that Hugh Hefner would continue to work and live in the mansion.[58] Later that year it was sold to Daren Metropoulos, a principal at private equity firm Metropoulos & Company, for $100 million. Metropoulos planned to reconnect the Playboy Mansion property with a neighboring estate that he purchased in 2009, combining the two for a 7.3 acre (3-hectare) compound as his own private residence.[59]  In May 2017, Eugena Washington was the last Playmate of the Year to be announced by Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion.[60]  Politics and philanthropy [ edit ]  The Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award was created by Christie Hefner \"to honor individuals who have made significant contributions in the vital effort to protect and enhance First Amendment rights for Americans.\"[61]  He donated and raised money for the Democratic Party.[62] In 2011, he referred to himself as an independent due to dissatisfaction with both the Democratic and Republican parties.[63] Nonetheless, in 2012, he supported Barack Obama\\'s reelection campaign.[64]  In 1978, Hefner helped organize fund-raising efforts that led to the restoration of the Hollywood Sign. He hosted a gala fundraiser at the Playboy Mansion and contributed $27,000 (or 1/9 of the total restoration costs) by purchasing the letter Y in a ceremonial auction.[65][66]  Hefner donated $100,000 to the University of Southern California\\'s School of Cinematic Arts to create a course called \"Censorship in Cinema\", and $2 million to endow a chair for the study of American film.[67]  Both through his charitable foundation and individually, Hefner also contributed to charities outside the sphere of politics and publishing, throwing fundraiser events for Much Love Animal Rescue as well as Generation Rescue,[68] an anti-vaccinationist campaign organization supported by Jenny McCarthy.  On November 18, 2010, Children of the Night founder and president Dr. Lois Lee presented Hefner with the organization\\'s first-ever Founder\\'s Hero of the Heart Award in appreciation for his unwavering dedication, commitment and generosity.[69]  On April 26, 2010, Hefner donated the last $900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to stop the development of the famed vista of the Hollywood Sign.[65] Sylvilagus palustris hefneri, an endangered subspecies of marsh rabbit, is named after him in honor of financial support that he provided.[70][71][72]  The Barbi Twins who are among a notable cohort of celebrity Playmates, including Pamela Anderson and Hefner\\'s third wife Crystal Harris, praised the publishing icon for providing centerfolds and extended members of the Playboy family with a platform for activism and advocacy on behalf of animal populations in need.[73][72]  Hefner supported legalizing same-sex marriage, and he stated that a fight for gay marriage was \"a fight for all our rights. Without it, we will turn back the sexual revolution and return to an earlier, puritanical time.\"[74]  Death [ edit ]  Hefner died at his home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, on September 27, 2017, at the age of 91.[75][76] The cause was sepsis brought on by an E. coli infection.[77][78][79]  He is interred at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles, in the $75,000 crypt beside Marilyn Monroe. \"Spending eternity next to Marilyn is an opportunity too sweet to pass up,\" Hefner had told the Los Angeles Times in 2009.[80]  Criticism [ edit ]  In The Guardian, journalist Suzanne Moore wrote that Hefner threatened to file a lawsuit against her for calling him a \"pimp\".[81] Defending her position, Moore argued that \"he was a man who bought and sold women to other men\".[81] She further stated that \"Part of Hefner\\'s business acumen was to make the selling of female flesh respectable and hip, to make soft porn acceptable.\"[81]  Writing for The Independent, English writer Julie Bindel argued that Hefner \"caused immeasurable damage by turning porn – and therefore the buying and selling of women\\'s bodies – into a legitimate business.\"[82]  In the Los Angeles Times, Robin Abcarian wrote that Hefner \"probably did more to the mainstream exploitation of women\\'s bodies than any other figure in American history,\" adding that he \"managed to convince many women that taking off their clothes for men\\'s pleasure was not just empowering, but a worthy goal in itself.\"[83] She further stated that Hefner \"embodied the aesthetic notion that images of women — and women themselves — exist to please men.\"[83]  Writing for Christianity Today, Ed Stetzer wrote that during his lifetime, when Christie Hefner visited the Playboy Mansion, he would have the residence systematically cleaned in order \"to keep the realities from his own daughter\".[84] Stezer further lamented the consequences of Hefner\\'s role as a \"general\" of the sexual revolution:  It\\'s hard to fathom that anyone would have known what this would have turned into. Parents growing up today are fighting to keep their children pure. Spouses are fighting to keep their marriages intact. And many enslaved and trapped in the adult entertainment industry have been figuratively and literally stripped not only of their clothes, but their very value as people made in the image of God. If this does not concern us, what will?[84]  Hefner\\'s former girlfriend, Holly Madison, said that while she lived in the Playboy Mansion, Hefner \"would encourage competition—and body image issues—between his multiple live-in girlfriends. His legacy is full of evidence of the exploitation of women for professional gain.\"[85]  Film adaptation [ edit ]  On October 3, 2017, it was announced that Academy Award-winning actor Jared Leto would play Hugh Hefner in a biopic directed by Brett Ratner with the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson. However, the film was indefinitely put on hold and it was confirmed that Leto would not portray Hefner following an emergence of sexual harassment allegations against Ratner on November 2, 2017.[86][87]  References [ edit ]',\n",

Spacey allegedly made a creepy move on Rapp back in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp just 14, the younger actor said.  “House of Cards” staffers have since made allegations of sexual misconduct against Spacey.',\n",

It consists of eight episodes. The pilot opens with the discovery of the plastic-wrapped body of popular high school student Laura Palmer, an event which moves residents of the small town of Twin Peaks, Washington. Sheriff Harry S. Truman investigates Palmer\\'s murder in conjunction with Dale Cooper, an eccentric FBI agent. As Cooper settles into his life in Twin Peaks, he meets the town\\'s residents, who each prove bizarre and quirky in their respective ways. As the series progresses, the seemingly normal appearance of the town begins to fade, revealing various secrets that expose Twin Peaks as the disturbed, unsettling town that it is.  Season 2 (1990–91) [ edit ]  Before the season began, a companion book, The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, was published. Some but not all of the diary entries mentioned during the season were in the book.[17]  The second season premiered on September 30, 1990, during the 1990–91 United States network television schedule. It consisted of 22 episodes. Lynch directed the first two, as well as the season\\'s seventh episode (\"Lonely Souls\"), where Laura Palmer\\'s killer is revealed. He also directed the season finale. In February 1991, Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, announced plans to put Twin Peaks on hiatus;[18] By May, Iger said \"it\\'s unlikely that Twin Peaks will return\".[19]  The season continues Cooper\\'s investigation of Laura Palmer\\'s murder. He receives some clues from a mysterious \"giant\" that appears to him in a dream. A new murder leads to the discovery of Laura Palmer\\'s killer. Later, Cooper is suspended by the FBI due to his participation in an unauthorized raid on the One Eyed Jacks casino. Cooper\\'s former partner, Windom Earle, escapes from a psychiatric hospital and comes to the town for a confrontation with Cooper. As the town prepares for its \"Miss Twin Peaks\" contest, Cooper tries to uncover the secret of the Black Lodge with help from Sheriff Truman.  The Return (2017) [ edit ]  The third season[32] is a limited series set 25 years after the events of the season two finale. All episodes were written by David Lynch and Mark Frost.[7] The series was originally planned to have nine episodes, however, after re-negotiations between Lynch and Showtime, the episode order was doubled, with Lynch confirmed to direct all episodes.[33] The new series premiered on May 21, 2017, and consists of 18 episodes identified only by number. Each episode (except the first, \"Part 1\" and the last, \"Part 18\") featured a different musical guest playing live at the Roadhouse as the end credits roll.  Episode titles [ edit ]  For the original series, creators David Lynch and Mark Frost assigned no episode titles, only episode numbers. When the series aired in Germany, titles were assigned, which were then translated to English. The episodes are untitled on the DVD sets, but the titled episodes appear on the official Twin Peaks CBS website and on Netflix when streaming the episodes.[50] Episode 2, known as \"Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer\" is also known as \"Zen and the Art of Killer-Catching\". When episodes 29 and 30 aired in Germany, they were aired as a single broadcast, with only episode 30 being assigned a title. Fans then decided to title episode 29 \"Miss Twin Peaks\", which is how the episode is titled both on the CBS website and on Netflix. However, when episode 29 was re-run in 1996, it was assigned an alternate title which translated to \"The Night of the Decision.\"[51][52]  Ratings [ edit ]  Twin Peaks : U.S. viewers per episode (millions) Season Episode number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 1 34.6 23.2 19.2 16.7 17.4 17.3 15.6 18.7 N/A 2 19.1 14.4 13.7 12.8 11.4 11.3 17.2 13.3 12.4 11.1 12.1 10.3 9.8 8.7 8.2 7.8 9.2 9.2 7.9 7.4 10.4 10.4 Audience measurement performed by Nielsen Media Research.

       " '‘Why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war?’  ‘No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night.’  Opinion Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too  Harvey Weinstein was a passionate cinephile, a risk taker, a patron of talent in film, a loving father and a monster.  For years, he was my monster.  This fall, I was approached by reporters, through different sources, including my dear friend Ashley Judd, to speak about an episode in my life that, although painful, I thought I had made peace with.  I had brainwashed myself into thinking that it was over and that I had survived; I hid from the responsibility to speak out with the excuse that enough people were already involved in shining a light on my monster. I didn’t consider my voice important, nor did I think it would make a difference.  In reality, I was trying to save myself the challenge of explaining several things to my loved ones: Why, when I had casually mentioned that I had been bullied like many others by Harvey, I had excluded a couple of details. And why, for so many years, we have been cordial to a man who hurt me so deeply. I had been proud of my capacity for forgiveness, but the mere fact that I was ashamed to describe the details of what I had forgiven made me wonder if that chapter of my life had really been resolved.  When so many women came forward to describe what Harvey had done to them, I had to confront my cowardice and humbly accept that my story, as important as it was to me, was nothing but a drop in an ocean of sorrow and confusion. I felt that by now nobody would care about my pain — maybe this was an effect of the many times I was told, especially by Harvey, that I was nobody.  We are finally becoming conscious of a vice that has been socially accepted and has insulted and humiliated millions of girls like me, for in every woman there is a girl. I am inspired by those who had the courage to speak out, especially in a society that elected a president who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women and whom we have all heard make a statement about how a man in power can do anything he wants to women.  Well, not anymore.  In the 14 years that I stumbled from schoolgirl to Mexican soap star to an extra in a few American films to catching a couple of lucky breaks in “Desperado” and “Fools Rush In,” Harvey Weinstein had become the wizard of a new wave of cinema that took original content into the mainstream. At the same time, it was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood. And even though I had proven them wrong, I was still a nobody.  One of the forces that gave me the determination to pursue my career was the story of Frida Kahlo, who in the golden age of the Mexican muralists would do small intimate paintings that everybody looked down on. She had the courage to express herself while disregarding skepticism. My greatest ambition was to tell her story. It became my mission to portray the life of this extraordinary artist and to show my native Mexico in a way that combated stereotypes.  The Weinstein empire, which was then Miramax, had become synonymous with quality, sophistication and risk taking — a haven for artists who were complex and defiant. It was everything that Frida was to me and everything I aspired to be.  I had started a journey to produce the film with a different company, but I fought to get it back to take it to Harvey.  I knew him a little bit through my relationship with the director Robert Rodriguez and the producer Elizabeth Avellan, who was then his wife, with whom I had done several films and who had taken me under their wing. All I knew of Harvey at the time was that he had a remarkable intellect, he was a loyal friend and a family man.  Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn’t my friendship with them — and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney — that saved me from being raped.  The deal we made initially was that Harvey would pay for the rights of work I had already developed. As an actress, I would be paid the minimum Screen Actors Guild scale plus 10 percent. As a producer, I would receive a credit that would not yet be defined, but no payment, which was not that rare for a female producer in the ’90s. He also demanded a signed deal for me to do several other films with Miramax, which I thought would cement my status as a leading lady.

I did not care about the money; I was so excited to work with him and that company. In my naïveté, I thought my dream had come true. He had validated the last 14 years of my life. He had taken a chance on me — a nobody. He had said yes.  Little did I know it would become my turn to say no.  No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night, hotel after hotel, location after location, where he would show up unexpectedly, including one location where I was doing a movie he wasn’t even involved with.  No to me taking a shower with him.  No to letting him watch me take a shower.  No to letting him give me a massage.  No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage.  No to letting him give me oral sex.  No to my getting naked with another woman.  No, no, no, no, no …  And with every refusal came Harvey’s Machiavellian rage.  I don’t think he hated anything more than the word “no.” The absurdity of his demands went from getting a furious call in the middle of the night asking me to fire my agent for a fight he was having with him about a different movie with a different client to physically dragging me out of the opening gala of the Venice Film Festival, which was in honor of “Frida,” so I could hang out at his private party with him and some women I thought were models but I was told later were high-priced prostitutes.  The range of his persuasion tactics went from sweet-talking me to that one time when, in an attack of fury, he said the terrifying words, “I will kill you, don’t think I can’t.”  When he was finally convinced that I was not going to earn the movie the way he had expected, he told me he had offered my role and my script with my years of research to another actress.  In his eyes, I was not an artist. I wasn’t even a person. I was a thing: not a nobody, but a body.  At that point, I had to resort to using lawyers, not by pursuing a sexual harassment case, but by claiming “bad faith,” as I had worked so hard on a movie that he was not intending to make or sell back to me. I tried to get it out of his company.  He claimed that my name as an actress was not big enough and that I was incompetent as a producer, but to clear himself legally, as I understood it, he gave me a list of impossible tasks with a tight deadline:  1. Get a rewrite of the script, with no additional payment.  2. Raise $10 million to finance the film.  3. Attach an A-list director.  4. Cast four of the smaller roles with prominent actors.  The #MeToo Moment The latest news and insights on the sexual harassment and misconduct scandals roiling society.  Much to everyone’s amazement, not least my own, I delivered, thanks to a phalanx of angels who came to my rescue, including Edward Norton, who beautifully rewrote the script several times and appallingly never got credit, and my friend Margaret Perenchio, a first-time producer, who put up the money. The brilliant Julie Taymor agreed to direct, and from then on she became my rock. For the other roles, I recruited my friends Antonio Banderas, Edward Norton and my dear Ashley Judd. To this day, I don’t know how I convinced Geoffrey Rush, whom I barely knew at the time.  Now Harvey Weinstein was not only rejected but also about to do a movie he did not want to do.  Ironically, once we started filming, the sexual harassment stopped but the rage escalated. We paid the price for standing up to him nearly every day of shooting. Once, in an interview he said Julie and I were the biggest ball busters he had ever encountered, which we took as a compliment.  Halfway through shooting, Harvey turned up on set and complained about Frida’s “unibrow.” He insisted that I eliminate the limp and berated my performance. Then he asked everyone in the room to step out except for me. He told me that the only thing I had going for me was my sex appeal and that there was none of that in this movie. So he told me he was going to shut down the film because no one would want to see me in that role.  It was soul crushing because, I confess, lost in the fog of a sort of Stockholm syndrome, I wanted him to see me as an artist: not only as a capable actress but also as somebody who could identify a compelling story and had the vision to tell it in an original way.  I was hoping he would acknowledge me as a producer, who on top of delivering his list of demands shepherded the script and obtained the permits to use the paintings. I had negotiated with the Mexican government, and with whomever I had to, to get locations that had never been given to anyone in the past — including Frida Kahlo’s houses and the murals of Kahlo’s husband, Diego Rivera, among others.  But all of this seemed to have no value. The only thing he noticed was that I was not sexy in the movie. He made me doubt if I was any good as an actress, but he never succeeded in making me think that the film was not worth making.  He offered me one option to continue. He would let me finish the film if I agreed to do a sex scene with another woman. And he demanded full-frontal nudity.  He had been constantly asking for more skin, for more sex. Once before, Julie Taymor got him to settle for a tango ending in a kiss instead of the lovemaking scene he wanted us to shoot between the character Tina Modotti, played by Ashley Judd, and Frida.  But this time, it was clear to me he would never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another. There was no room for negotiation.  I had to say yes. By now so many years of my life had gone into this film. We were about five weeks into shooting, and I had convinced so many talented people to participate. How could I let their magnificent work go to waste?  I had asked for so many favors, I felt an immense pressure to deliver and a deep sense of gratitude for all those who did believe in me and followed me into this madness. So I agreed to do the senseless scene.  I arrived on the set the day we were to shoot the scene that I believed would save the movie. And for the first and last time in my career, I had a nervous breakdown: My body began to shake uncontrollably, my breath was short and I began to cry and cry, unable to stop, as if I were throwing up tears.  Since those around me had no knowledge of my history of Harvey, they were very surprised by my struggle that morning. It was not because I would be naked with another woman. It was because I would be naked with her for Harvey Weinstein. But I could not tell them then.  My mind understood that I had to do it, but my body wouldn’t stop crying and convulsing. At that point, I started throwing up while a set frozen still waited to shoot. I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse. As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene.  By the time the filming of the movie was over, I was so emotionally distraught that I had to distance myself during the postproduction.  When Harvey saw the cut film, he said it was not good enough for a theatrical release and that he would send it straight to video.  This time Julie had to fight him without me and got him to agree to release the film in one movie theater in New York if we tested it to an audience and we scored at least an 80.  Less than 10 percent of films achieve that score on a first screening.  I didn’t go to the test. I anxiously awaited to receive the news. The film scored 85.  And again, I heard Harvey raged. In the lobby of a theater after the screening, he screamed at Julie. He balled up one of the scorecards and threw it at her. It bounced off her nose. Her partner, the film’s composer Elliot Goldenthal, stepped in, and Harvey physically threatened him.  Once he calmed down, I found the strength to call Harvey to ask him also to open the movie in a theater in Los Angeles, which made a total of two theaters. And without much ado, he gave me that. I have to say sometimes he was kind, fun and witty — and that was part of the problem: You just never knew which Harvey you were going to get.  Months later, in October 2002, this film, about my hero and inspiration — this Mexican artist who never truly got acknowledged in her time with her limp and her unibrow, this film that Harvey never wanted to do, gave him a box office success that no one could have predicted, and despite his lack of support, added six Academy Award nominations to his collection, including best actress.  Even though “Frida” eventually won him two Oscars, I still didn’t see any joy. He never offered me a starring role in a movie again. The films that I was obliged to do under my original deal with Miramax were all minor supporting roles.  Years later, when I ran into him at an event, he pulled me aside and told me he had stopped smoking and he had had a heart attack. He said he’d fallen in love and married Georgina Chapman, and that he was a changed man. Finally, he said to me: “You did well with ‘Frida’; we did a beautiful movie.”  I believed him. Harvey would never know how much those words meant to me. He also would never know how much he hurt me. I never showed Harvey how terrified I was of him. When I saw him socially, I’d smile and try to remember the good things about him, telling myself that I went to war and I won.  But why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war to tell our stories when we have so much to offer? Why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity?  I think it is because we, as women, have been devalued artistically to an indecent state, to the point where the film industry stopped making an effort to find out what female audiences wanted to see and what stories we wanted to tell.  According to a recent study, between 2007 and 2016, only 4 percent of directors were female and 80 percent of those got the chance to make only one film. In 2016, another study found, only 27 percent of words spoken in the biggest movies were spoken by women. And people wonder why you didn’t hear our voices sooner. I think the statistics are self-explanatory — our voices are not welcome.  Until there is equality in our industry, with men and women having the same value in every aspect of it, our community will continue to be a fertile ground for predators.  I am grateful for everyone who is listening to our experiences. I hope that adding my voice to the chorus of those who are finally speaking out will shed light on why it is so difficult, and why so many of us have waited so long. Men sexually harassed because they could. Women are talking today because, in this new era, we finally can.',\n",

       " 'Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise’s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he’s still struggling to salvage what’s left of his marriage.  The Enquirer’s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, “Rachel and Daniel haven’t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.” The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‘554 days’.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple’s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York’s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, “The whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don’t buy it for a minute.”  When you consider Daniel Craig’s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, “Being on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.” If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now – all of a sudden – he’s back to working on James Bond?  Either the report was never accurate to begin with, or he’s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories – and how they’ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat – one wouldn’t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.  What do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel’s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he’s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.  Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images for Sony Pictures',\n",

       " 'Bethenny Frankel & Ex Jason Hoppy Ordered By Judge To Complete Forensic Custody Evaluations With Daughter Bryn  Bethenny Frankel‘s custody war with ex Jason Hoppy is far from over.  After the years it took for the Real Housewives of New York vet to finalize her divorce from the New York native, it appears that the twosome are still battling over custody of daughter Bryn Hoppy. We feel so badly for the seven-year-old.  Related: Stephen Belafonte Claims Ex Mel B Is An Addict  As you may recall, back in December, Frankel sued Hoppy for custody of their shared child. On Thursday, the Bravolebrity faced off against Jason in court, as the two appeared before a Manhattan judge. According to an E! News source, Judge Michael Katz ultimately ruled that Frankel and Hoppy need to get forensic evaluations done with their daughter.  The insider shared:  “Back in 2013 when the divorce and custody initially happened, this same doctor did a forensic custody evaluation at the time. The judge today ordered that same doctor do another forensic custody evaluation to update his first report from 2013. He will meet with Bryn and Jason, and then Bryn with Bethenny ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ separately but in person ├óΓé¼ΓÇ£ and observe each of them with the child.”  While we bet Bethenny is annoyed by this legal hoop, it’s certainly a fair way to assess Bryn’s respective relationships with her mom and dad. The tipster continued:  “They are due back in court on May 10th and the evaluations are to be completed by then, that’s why the judge gave them so much time between now and then.”  We can’t blame the Bravo personality for being skittish around her baby daddy. Last October, Hoppy struck a plea deal after stalking and harassing his former flame. The businessman was ordered to comply with an order of protection for six months and obey all laws, and if he did, his case could be dismissed.  The protective order is slated to expire on April 20. Man, oh man.  Hopefully, this family feud hasn’t caused any mental distress for Jason and Bethenny’s innocent daughter. *Sigh*  [Image via Michael Carpenter/WENN.]',\n",
       " 'Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Elle King‘s wedding day was anything but textbook.  On Saturday, the “Ex’s and Oh’s” singer was set to wed fiancé Andrew “Fergie” Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead.  “Skipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F–KING DEATH METAL,” King shared on Instagram.  The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson’s proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of “Say Yes to the Dress,” Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.  “We met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,” she said. “We hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, ‘You can’t go home.’ And I didn’t get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.”  While she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.  “Gotta say … no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it’s hard to not smile in this California sunshine,” she wrote.  Earlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.  “Been a really rough and insane start to this year,” King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. “Lately I don’t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She’s my best friend and the only true loyalty I’ve ever known.  “Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don’t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,” she continued. “Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you’re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don’t let anyone make you feel fearful or small. Love yourself.”  A rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment.',\n",

Gal Gadot, who plays the titular heroine in Patty Jenkins’ film, joined original Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter on the red carpet.  Carter, who starred on the beloved TV series in the 1970s, previously teamed up with Gadot at the United Nations last year, when Wonder Woman was named an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. (The U.N. ultimately dropped that campaign two months later, after the initiative was met with criticism.)  “In some magical and mystical way, there lies within each of us Wonder Woman,” Carter said at the time. “She is real. She lives and she breathes. I know this because she lives in me, and she lives in the stories that these women tell me, day in and day out. I see it in the letters and in the stories. I read it on social media. I see it in the tears that fall from the eyes of the women who say it saved them from some awful thing that they endured — because they saw that they could do something great.”  Alberto E.

Based on early reviews, the future looks bright for Diana. Gadot will also reprise the role on screen for Justice League.

       " 'ABC/Jeff Daly(LOS ANGELES) -- Former Bachelor contestant Corinne Olympios has broken her silence about the incident that took place on the set of Bachelor in Paradise earlier this month.  On Wednesday afternoon, the reality TV star confirmed in a statement obtained by ABC News that she was a part of the incident, which prompted Warner Brothers, the studio behind the show, to suspend production and to launch an investigation into allegations of misconduct.  Though she did not go into detail, Olympios explained that she is currently in therapy to \"begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma\" that she sustained while shooting the show in Mexico.  She also said that she has retained an attorney to \"obtain justice.\"  “I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place,\" she said, adding, \"As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.\"  A representative for Warner Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for ABC, the network on which the show airs, referred a request for comment to Warner Brothers, since the incident deals with production.  On Sunday afternoon, Warner Brothers released a statement confirming that production on season four of the show had been suspended and \"appropriate responsive action\" would be taken following a \"thorough investigation.\"  Two days later, Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise, urged fans to \"be patient\" and apologized for \"any inconvenience and disappointment\" caused by the show\\'s suspension.  Last week, ABC released the names of several Bachelor in Paradise contestants. In addition to Olympios, they included Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode and DeMario Jackson.

       " \"GULLIVER recently wrote about a pet that suffered a grizzly end after it was not permitted to fly. Spirit Airlines refused to allow a hamster on board as an emotional-support animal and it ended up being flushed down an airport toilet. But sometimes it is more dangerous for an animal to be permitted to ascend to 35,000 feet. Particularly, it seems, if it is flying on United Airlines.  On March 12th, on a flight from Houston to New York, a United Airlines flight attendant knowingly stowed a French bulldog in the overhead compartment, where it died, the family that owned the dog alleges. United quickly apologised to the family for what it called “a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin.” The airline promised an investigation “to prevent this from ever happening again.”  Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.              But on United, things like this seem to happen again and again. Last year, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel died in a United plane’s cargo hold when the flight was delayed on the tarmac—also in Houston—for two hours. Most infamously, a giant rabbit called Simon travelling from London to the Iowa State Fair died on a United flight, possibly freezing to death because it was subjected to cold temperatures or placed next to dry ice. A week of headlines in British tabloids, such as “Now United’s killing fluffy bunnies!”, left its reputation in one of its most valuable foreign markets in tatters. And on March 14th, United fessed up to yet another blunder, this time flying a German Shepherd dog from Oregon to Japan instead of its intended destination, Kansas City in Missouri.  In fact, according to data from America’s Department of Transportation, United was far more dangerous to fly on as a doggy or bunny last year than any other airline. Some 18 animals perished on United flights, compared with two each on American, Delta, and Alaska, and zero on all other airlines tracked by the department. Some 13 animals were also reported injured on United flights; no other airline had more than one injury. That comes out to 2.24 incidents for every 10,000 animals transported on United. The second-worst offender, American, had 0.87 incidents per 10,000.  United gained notoriety for its treatment of human passengers last April when a Vietnamese-American passenger, David Dao, was forcibly dragged off an overbooked flight in Chicago. The company’s initial response was possibly the worst bit of crisis-PR in history. As videos of the bloodied man quickly went viral, Oscar Munoz, the carrier’s boss, woodenly apologised for having to “re-accommodate” customers and blamed the flyer for not co-operating. After a passenger backlash the company quickly changed its policy and sought to make amends. Yet some aviation analysts reckon that the death of Simon the bunny did much more damage to United’s reputation in Britain than the manhandling of Dr Dao did in America. What is clear is that its brand will continue to suffer if it does not start treating its animal passengers, as well as it human ones, better.\",\n",
       " 'In Hollywood, they now talk about ‘‘the Lena Dunham effect’’ and ‘‘the Jill Soloway effect’’: Studios are starting to search for female-driven shows and recruit women to create them. In their ‘‘Odd Couple’’ trailers — one O.C.D. neat, one tousled — on different coasts, Dunham and Soloway have been plotting insurrection and nurturing female directors.  Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’  Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.  The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’  ‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’  Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’  For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.  Leigh Janiak is a 35-year-old with a laid-back manner, but you sense immediately that she knows where she’s going. Janiak pragmatically plotted her rise while she was a producer’s assistant for Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company. She refused an offer to direct an episode of a network TV show on the condition that she shadow a veteran director first. She was afraid it would stigmatize her.  ‘‘Why would anyone give me $40 million to get a movie off the ground if just last week I was doing this little training program?’’ she asked, over lunch at Little Dom’s in Los Feliz. She knew that guys who made horror and science-fiction movies could make the jump to blockbusters more easily than women who wrote rom-coms could. With her writing partner, she did a $1 million horror movie, ‘‘Honeymoon,’’ a goosebumps-inducing something-bad-happens-in-a-cabin-in-the-woods story (my favorite genre) starring the alluring redhead Rose Leslie, best known as Ygritte, the Wildling love interest of Kit Harington in ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’  That attracted the attention of the married producing team Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher, who tapped Janiak, raised Catholic and a former Ph.D. candidate in modern Jewish studies at the University of Chicago, to co-write and direct a remake of the cult horror movie ‘‘The Craft,’’ about witchcraft at a Catholic prep school.  She said she has no patience when she hears about female directors who melt into a puddle of tears after tangling with a grouchy cinematographer, saying: ‘‘I hear stories like that and think, If you are going to let people walk all over you, why do you even want to direct?’’  Fixing the gender problem in Hollywood is important for women like Janiak. But it’s also important for women and girls everywhere. ‘‘We are influencing culture, which is why it’s so dangerous, I think, not to have more women making movies,’’ she said. ‘‘Why can’t I direct ‘Superman’?’’',\n",
       " 'Nearly two years after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, the former power couple have reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for this summer, Us Weekly confirms.  According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward.

From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!',\n",

       " 'Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.  The world’s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair. “Today, I’m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Jenner’s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show, “I Am Cait.”  Her newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner — who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner — to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a Republican in Hollywood. On her reality show, Jenner expressed support for Ted Cruz and sparred with activists, who were as experienced in trans-politics as she was unversed. She voted for Trump in the 2016 election (but is no longer a fan).  Her conservatism made her a pariah in the left-leaning entertainment industry, where she’s been criticized for not doing enough to help the transgender community. Jenner spoke candidly with Variety about the pain of that rejection.  “No matter what you say or do, they think you don’t get it because you’re this kind of white, privileged person,” says Jenner. She disputes the notion that she hasn’t worked hard, or that her wealth disqualifies her from being an advocate. “I haven’t turned my back on anybody,” she says. But Jenner has received a cold shoulder from some of her peers: “I’ve felt it big time, and it hurts. Sometimes this community can be really tough.”  Jenner, who briefly considered running for senator, decided she could be more useful fighting for trans rights as a Republican liaison on Capitol Hill. She likens the civil rights battle to what the gay community faced 40 years ago on the road to marriage equality.  Every few weeks, Jenner travels to Washington to tell her story. She’s held long meetings with members of Trump’s White House and roughly 50 members of the House and Senate — to personally make the case for equality.  She’s patiently endured invasive questions about her body and genitalia, all in an effort to change people’s minds.  She says that these meetings are conducted away from the cameras. “I met with Paul Ryan,” she says. “I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights.” What do they say to her? “I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” says Jenner, who did not want to elaborate on conversations that were confidential.  Margaret Hoover, the president of the American Unity Fund, a Republican-funded group that advocates for LGBTQ rights, says that Jenner is uniquely positioned to educate. “Think of your average Republican in Washington,” Hoover says, noting that the party is getting older and less diverse. “It’s basically like every white friend of your 70-year-old dad. At the 1976 Olympic Games, they were all in the prime of their life, and Bruce Jenner was their hero. They idolized Bruce.” As a result, Jenner has been an effective ambassador. When they hear the word “transgender,” they might imagine a man in a dress. But when they see Caitlyn, they agree that she should use the women’s bathroom.  Jenner was originally hopeful about Trump, given that he promised to make LGBTQ rights part of his platform. But since taking office, he’s stoked fears by rolling back protections in schools and vowing to ban transgender people from the military. Jenner says her message to Trump, whom she met during the campaign but hasn’t spoken with as president, is simple. “Get over it! I honestly don’t know what happened when he got in there. It was extraordinarily disappointing,” she says.  In February 2017, Jenner lashed out against Trump on Twitter for withdrawing federal guidelines that allowed transgender youths to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. “From one Republican to another, this is a disaster,” she tweeted. “You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.”  Jenner says Trump never reached out. (A source with knowledge of her thinking says Jenner would like to meet with the president after the midterm elections, but not in front of the press.) “He’s not been doing a very good job, but it’s not over yet,” she says.  Jenner believes that the United States should pass a law that allows transgender citizens to enlist in the armed forces. “We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality,” she says, pointing to measures passed by other countries, from Israel to England. “It’s going to take some time, but we’re working on it.”  Jenner wants everyone to know that she’s found happiness. “My life is so simple,” she says. “It’s just to be myself all day. I think people think when you transition, it is this tremendous thing, and now you’re a totally different person. I’m still the same person. Caitlyn lived inside me all my life.”  As a member of America’s most notorious reality TV family (“Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” for those of you living under a rock), Jenner gets asked to be photographed a lot in public. “If I’m out, I take a minimum of 30 selfies with people,” she says. “It drives everyone around me crazy.” This isn’t done out of vanity. She’s trying to prove a point. “That may be the first time they’ve met anybody who’s trans,” Jenner says about her interactions with her fans. “I want that to be a pleasurable experience. I want to be nice to people. I want to have a smile on my face. And they walk away and say, ‘Oh, my God! Caitlyn was so nice.’ That’s the way I want them to think of trans people. That we’re nice.”  CREDIT: victoria stevens for Variety  She’s disappointed that “I Am Cait” got canceled in 2016. “I wish we could’ve done more,” she says. She regrets talking about politics on the show. “Reality TV loves drama.” She’s certainly dealt with her share of that. The tabloids are reporting that she’s dating a 22-year-old transgender woman named Sophia Hutchins, whom she took to the ESPYs a few weeks ago. Hutchins is at her house on the day of our interview, and she follows us into Jenner’s office to listen to our conversation. Although they sound like a couple — Jenner asks Hutchins for the name of the last great movie they saw together (Hutchins suggests “I, Tonya”) — they deny that they are. “We are not going to get into that,” Jenner says. “But we are very close. We do a lot of things together. We’re kind of inseparable. We’re the best of friends.”  Regardless of the nature of their personal relationship, Hutchins is the executive director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, which was formed last year to advance transgender rights. Jenner auctioned off a Porsche that she owned to raise funds. But her efforts there, too, have been kept under the radar. “Coming from a reality show, where every detail of your life is documented, to not seeking any press is kind of a big change,” Hutchins says. “Caitlyn is not working on these issues for press attention. She’s doing it because she genuinely wants to help the community.”  Jenner hasn’t found it easy to parse the PC rules of transgender politics. For example, she talks about how much she loved “The Danish Girl,” the 2015 biopic starring cisgender actor Eddie Redmayne as the artist Lili Elbe. “I thought it was good to have it out there,” Jenner says. “GLAAD talked to me and said, ‘Don’t mention you even saw the movie!’ And then all the flak came down about Eddie Redmayne doing it. I went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party, and I’m thinking, ‘What if he’s there? I can’t even be seen with him.’ That’s horrible!”  (“GLAAD shared concerns that transgender community members voiced about the film as a courtesy so that Caitlyn would be aware of them,” said a GLAAD rep.)  Before transitioning, she once auditioned for “Superman” and co-starred on TV’s “CHiPs.” She’s open to acting again. She says she’s working on something that would employ an all-transgender cast and crew. “You have to wait and see,” says Jenner, declining to give specifics. She reveals that her fantasy role would be as a comic-book villainess. “In a Marvel movie, I want to play the baddest-ass lady you’ve ever seen in your life. They got the wicked queen or the wicked lady. Just do the makeup and the outfit. And I got the deep voice.”  Jenner, whose autobiography, “The Secrets of My Life,” was published in 2017, sees her 10 kids as often as she can. She concedes that some of them are closer to her than others. She beams at Kylie being on the cover of Forbes as the youngest “self-made” almost billionaire. Although she didn’t attend her son Brody’s June wedding in Indonesia, she’ll see him soon. She’s supportive of her stepdaughter Kim’s recent visit with Trump, in which she convinced him to commute the sentence of a woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. “I thought they did the right thing,” Jenner says. “I was very proud of her.” As for her ex-wife Kris, they aren’t as friendly. “We haven’t talked in a long time.”  Jenner could see herself doing another reality TV show — maybe one where she parachutes into parts of the world as a transgender rights explorer. She doesn’t think she’ll appear in future episodes of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” “At this point, no,” she says. “But you never know.”  Watch more from Variety‘s interview with Caitlyn Jenner below.',\n",

       " 'Despite her husband, Bobby Zarin’s recent hospitalization Jill Zarin put on a brave face and hosted her 5th Annual Luxury Luncheon over the weekend.  The bittersweet event, which raises money for the International Thyroid Oncology Group, was especially difficult for Jill this year since she all she wanted to do was skip the event and be by her husband’s side instead  “Bobby wanted me to be here. I didn’t want to come. I wasn’t going to postpone it, I was going not come, and people would understand. But Bobby said you have to go because we’re going to raise money for thyroid cancer,” Jill told E! News.  As for how she’s doing since Bobby hospitalization, Jill says “I’m running on full adrenaline. I haven’t eaten in days. I’ve lost eight pounds.”  Jill also revealed that she reconciled with Ramona Singer; saying that Ramona has been by her side non-stop during Bobby’s hospitalization.  “It means everything to me. Ramona came to the hospital and sat with me for a few hours. She’s been emailing me and texting me every day,” said Jill. “The past doesn’t mean anything; it doesn’t mean anything to us. Others haven’t called, but…I’m blessed, I’m so lucky, I’m surrounded by friends.”  For now, Jill says she and Bobby are taking things “one hour at a time.” Adding, “He had a good day yesterday.”  At her Luxury Luncheon, Jill was surrounded by many former and current Housewives including a few of her Real Housewives of New York friends like Cindy Barshop, Tinsley Mortimer, Luann de Lesseps and Kelly Bensimon.  Ramona, who also attended the event with her new boyfriend Steve, opened up about being there for Jill despite their past issues.  “When I heard about Bobby, my heart broke. Jill and I have had a very interesting relationship over the years. But the thing is, when someone needs me, I am so there. When something bad happens in someone’s life, you need people around you,” Ramona explained. “I went to visit Bobby, he was in great spirits, God Bless him, and Jill and I had a 45-minute talk. I think we both let our walls down and it was woman to woman, friend to friend. It was a wonderful chat, and we came away from it in a really good, bonding manner. Sometimes, unfortunately, tragedy brings people closer.”  I know we all make fun of how insane and crazy Ramona is but I think she does have a compassionate and kind side to her, especially when the cameras aren’t around. We all saw how great Ramona was with Bethenny during her health scare last year and now this with Jill. It’s so sweet to see the Housewives come together to support Jill during this difficult time. The AATRH team continues to keep Bobby and Jill in our prayers.  Are you surprised Jill and Ramona have reconciled? Do you think Ramona has a compassionate side we don’t see on RHONY?

An insider told Star: “In hindsight, they really had nothing in common besides great sex. He’s sat up many nights going over what happened, and he’s analysed it again and again in therapy. He realises his relationship with Angie was toxic from the start.”  Brad has reportedly admitted he drank too much while married to Angelina and that their hectic schedules and responsibilities as parents drove them apart.  The source added: “Brad’s demons got a hold of him … Ange used to be so exciting.

       " 'Jennifer Garner confronted Ben Affleck‘s girlfriend Lindsay Shookus in person after she found out about their affair in 2015, sources tell PEOPLE.  Garner was on a work trip to New York City when she approached Shookus about the fling. “Lindsay refused to back down or quit the affair,” says a source.    Responds a source close to Shookus: “Jennifer and Lindsay do not have any relationship.”  Multiple sources have told PEOPLE that Affleck and Shookus started having an affair in 2013, two years before the actor and Garner announced their separation. Shookus was also still with her husband Kevin Miller, then a fellow SNL producer. The two split in 2014.  However, other sources close to Affleck and Shookus maintain that the two were just friends and didn’t date before their respective separations.  Sources also say Garner spoke to Shookus’ ex about the affair. After appearing on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Miller is now a supervising producer, Garner sought him out for a conversation.  The first source says she showed him text messages between Affleck and Shookus, adding, “she had proof.” (Miller and Shookus were already split at the time.)  Affleck and Shookus have been spending time together in L.A. since going public with their relationship last week.  For much more on Affleck and Shookus, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

They do it better than anyone.”  Shookus married Kevin Miller in 2010 and the two share a daughter. “They’re both really good friends still,” says a source close to the situation. “They’re both good, devoted parents. Lindsay and Kevin’s marriage didn’t end over infidelity. There were issues they couldn’t resolve and they realized they were better as friends than together.”  Garner is handling her ex’s public relationship fine, sources have said. “Nothing is new for her here,” says one insider. “She’s in mama-bear mode.”',\n",

       " 'Celebrity makeup artists work with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Their job is to make the stars look their best when they appear in public for movie premieres, fashion shows, awards ceremonies and other red-carpet events. These professionals may also work on the sets of movies, TV shows and theatrical productions. Although makeup artists generally make low or average salaries, celebrity makeup artists tend to make more money than the typical makeup artist.  Job Description  Celebrity makeup artists work closely with their clients, many of whom are A-list celebrities. They use their expert knowledge of lipsticks, eyeliners, blushes, moisturizers, shampoos and conditioners, and other products to help their clients look their best or to achieve a desired look. They must understand the effects of stage lighting on a person’s appearance and apply makeup accordingly. Celebrity makeup artists generally work in comfortable, well-lit settings. They may be required to work odd hours, depending on their client’s schedule.  Hourly and Daily Wages  Hourly wages for makeup artists working with celebrities in the motion picture and television industries is typically quite high. The website Celebrity Net Worth estimates hourly rates at $41.31 — about double that of a regular makeup artist who works in a salon. According to Crystal Wright, president of Crystal Agency and author of \"The Hair, Makeup & Fashion Styling Career Guide,\" top celebrity makeup artists can make as much as $2,500 in a single day.  Video of the Day Brought to you by Sapling Brought to you by Sapling  Annual Wages  Annual wages for makeup artists who work with Hollywood celebrities are also quite high. Celebrity Net Worth estimates the average annual salary is $85,930. This is almost double that of regular makeup artists, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says made $45,010 per year as of May 2009.  Employment Outlook  Of the roughly 38,000 makeup artists working in the United States as of 2006, only 2,100 worked with celebrities in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Needless to say, this field is extremely competitive. For those who work on film sets, the job may be somewhat unstable and fluctuate according to filming schedules. Celebrity makeup artists may increase their earnings by designing their own line of makeup products, publishing books and endorsing beauty products.',\n",
       " 'Gregg Allman was laid to rest Saturday afternoon in Macon, Georgia, where the Allman Brothers Band singer was buried near his brother Duane Allman and band mate Berry Oakley.  Former president Jimmy Carter, Peter Frampton, ex-wife Cher and many of Allman’s bandmates like Jaimoe, Dickey Betts and Derek Trucks were among those that attended the private ceremony at Snow’s Memorial Chapel in Macon. Allman’s children Devon, Layla and Delilah Island, his niece (and Duane’s daughter) Galadrielle, his lifelong friend Chank Middleton and his manager Michael Lehmen delivered eulogies at the service.  As requested by Allman’s estate, mourners wore jeans to the funeral instead of suits. Following the private service, hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band’s music, lined the route along the funeral procession to nearby Rose Hill Cemetery, where Allman was buried close to Duane, who died in a 1971 motorcycle accident.  While the burial was also private, hundreds of fans gathered on a hill overlooking Allman’s grave while the rocker was taken to his final resting place.  Ironically, Allman was scheduled to perform Saturday night at Macon’s Grand Opera House before he canceled his 2017 tour plans as he battled health issues.  In a statement Friday, the 92-year-old Carter said he would attend Allman’s funeral to “pay his respects” to the singer.  “Rosalynn and I were deeply saddened when we learned that Gregg Allman had passed. Gregg and the Allman Brothers Band were very helpful to me in my 1976 presidential campaign. Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,” Carter said. “Gregg Allman was there when I needed him and Rosalynn and I have always been grateful to him.”  In 2016, Carter was on hand to give Allman an honorary doctorate of humanities degree at Macon’s Mercer University.  Allman died May 27th at the age of 69 at his home near Savannah, Georgia following a battle with liver cancer.  Allman’s manager Michael Lehman said Allman spent his final night listening to tracks off his upcoming solo LP Southern Blood; a rep told Rolling Stone the album would arrive in September.  “He said the last few days he was just, you know, tired,” Lehman said told the Associated Press. He was looking forward to sharing it with the world and that dream is going to be realized. I told him that his legacy is going to be protected, and the gift that he gave to the music world will continue to live on forever.”  Gregg Allman, Southern rock pioneer, fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come.

(July 13) AP  Queen Elizabeth II stands with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump in the Grand Corridor at Windsor Castle in Windsor, July 13, 2018. (Photo: STEVE PARSONS/ AFP/Getty Images)  WINDSOR, England — President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Windsor Castle Friday evening outside London to meet Queen Elizabeth II and be treated to the kind of royal pomp-and-ceremony the president loves and the British love staging.  The presidential couple arrived at the massive 900-plus-year-old fortress just miles west of London at about 5 p.m. local time, and shook hands with Her Majesty, 92, who was meeting her 12th sitting president and the fourth she has hosted at her weekend residence since the 1980s.  The first lady, her hair up in a low chignon, wore a conservative pale pink Dior skirt suit with a narrow belt and a high collar.  The queen wore her usual royal outfit, a periwinkle blue coat over a patterned blue-and-yellow dress with a matching blue hat, plus white gloves, sensible black shoes and her ever-present black handbag.

(Photo: Matt Dunham, AP)  Her husband, Prince Philip, 97, has retired from public life and was not there.  The weather was cooperative: The temperature was 79 degrees, with the sun peeking though a partly cloudy light blue sky.  The Trumps, who had arrived via Marine One landing on the grass east of the castle, were driven into the castle Quadrangle and greeted the queen. Then they stood under a covered dais as a Coldstream Guard of Honor played the U.S. national anthem. The Trumps stood with hands over hearts; the queen with her white-gloved hands folded.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/ AP)  As per usual in a royal welcoming ceremony, the monarch and the president inspected the Guard of Honor as a medley of U.S. service hymns were played. The diminutive monarch and the tall president walked slowly past each file three ranks deep, then watched scarlet-clad troops in bearskin hats march around the Quadrangle.  Although reporters couldn\\'t hear what they said, the queen and the Trumps were seen to have exchanged some remarks during the ceremonies, and at one point Her Majesty and Melania Trump exchanged warm smiles.  About 10 minutes after the Trumps arrived, they went inside the castle (which has about 1,000 rooms and occupies 13 acres) to join the queen for tea. The palace did not release details about which room or what was served, but later a picture of the three of them posing in the Grand Corridor of the castle was released.  The royal handshakes followed the president\\'s meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister Theresa May at Chequers, the PM\\'s country retreat.  Also earlier, Melania Trump, dressed in a Victoria Beckham dress of boldly colorful stripes, visited the Royal Chelsea Hospital in London where she tried her hand at bowls with aging British Army veterans.

The indictments are part of the ongoing special counsel probe into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia – a probe regularly denounced by the president.  The meeting between the Trumps and the queen took place against a backdrop of the president\\'s critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the teetering Tory government, its ongoing infighting over Brexit and Trump\\'s own suggestions to May about how to achieve the divorce from the European Union.  But he had nothing but gushing praise for the queen in his headline-making interview Friday with The Sun, Britain\\'s largest-circulation newspaper owned by Trump\\'s media mogul pal, Rupert Murdoch.  Trump described the queen as “a tremendous woman” in the interview.  \"I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well,\" Trump said. “If you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don’t see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman.\"  The queen hosts multiple foreign dignitaries every week, though usually at her working residence at Buckingham Palace in London. But an audience between the United Kingdom\\'s head of state with the head of state of Britain\\'s closest ally is considered crucial for both sides.

(Photo: Matt Dunham, AP)  Certainly, President Trump was keen on it, according to the U.S. ambassador to Britain speaking the week before the Trumps arrived. Doing it at Windsor also had advantages in that it got him out of London where massive anti-Trump demonstrations are taking place, complete with a giant Trump \"baby\" blimp balloon aimed at mocking him.  No such derision will be heard from Her Majesty.  Under the British constitutional monarchy, the figurehead monarch is \"above\" politics, and the queen has been scrupulous during her 66-year reign in keeping her opinions to herself, no matter the controversies swirling around whoever is presented to her.  Thus, the times when her views do become known are rare and memorable, as when she was overheard at a 2016 garden party criticizing Chinese officials for being \"very rude\" during a state visit to Britain by President Xi Jinping the year before. Her remark was huge news because it was unprecedented, uncharacteristic and undiplomatic.  Although there were advance calls in Britain from some quarters to cancel the meeting between the queen and the Trumps, that was never going to happen. When it comes to these meetings, the monarch follows the instructions from the government of the day.  May was the one who issued the invitation to Trump when she met him at the White House soon after he took office. Initially, it was supposed to be a \"state visit\" featuring even more elaborate ceremony, but that was later downgraded to an audience as it became clearer that Trump\\'s presence in London would be less than welcome.  Instead, an elaborate banquet was staged Thursday night by May when she hosted the Trumps at a black-tie dinner with British business leaders at Blenheim Palace, the home of the Dukes of Marlborough in Oxfordshire west of London where Winston Churchill was born.  The teatime meeting with the queen lasted less then an hour; afterwards, the Trumps were scheduled to depart for a weekend in Scotland where the half-Scots president (on his mother\\'s side) owns two golf courses.  Next week, they will travel to Finland where the president will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki on Monday.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ulthLz',\n",

       " 'Khloé Kardashian sure likes dating athletes, but not all of them are the right fit for the Kardashian family. As many have learned, dating one of these sisters puts you under a microscope, leaving all your personal drama out for the world to scrutinize.  Just ask Tristan Thompson, Khloé’s current boyfriend. We all know a whole lot about how he’s allegedly neglecting his new kid to hang out with her. I suppose it takes a certain resilience to handle that level of attention. One of Khloé’s exes explained why he decided “thanks but no thanks” to joining the gossip mill.  Sports Illustrated interviewed Houston Rockets baller James Harden for their March 6 issue. Harden and Khloé dated for about 8 months in 2015 but broke it off. In the interview, Harden doesn’t say much about his relationship, but he does explain why living that tabloid life wasn’t for him.  “I didn’t like all the attention,” said Harden, “I feel like it was for no reason. I wasn’t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don’t need that. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it wasn’t me. I don’t need pictures of myself when I’m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that.”  Oh my god! He doesn’t care what shoes he’s wearing? This guy is definitely not Mr. Kardashian material. Luckily, he seems to have quite a career going on and hopefully also some less public love in his life.  [Photos: Getty]',\n",

       " 'Mariah Carey is not having a \"midlife crisis\", despite a manufactured tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We\\'re told it\\'s \"not true\".    The allegation comes from OK!, which claims the singer was \"partying with a crowd\" that was \"half her age\" at Catch restaurant in Los Angeles last month. A so-called \"source\" tells the outlet, \"She clearly thought she was the hippest, coolest person there, when in reality everyone was rolling their eyes.\" Carey is \"regressing\", further purports the magazine\\'s supposed insider, adding that she has recruited a group of \"young girlfriends\" and is picking up \"boy toys\" in an attempt to \"fill a void\".    But Gossip Cop investigated, and a rep for the singer exclusively assures us the entire report is \"not true\". Carey, despite having recently separated from Bryan Tanaka, is not going through a \"midlife crisis\", and any claims made otherwise are simply false. What\\'s more, we\\'re further told the star is currently at the \"top of her game\". From the number of inaccurate stories that OK! is pumping out, it\\'s clear that the tabloid is in a state of crisis, not Carey.    Unfortunately, we\\'re not remotely surprised by the outlet\\'s latest piece of fiction. In March, Gossip Cop corrected the magazine for falsely alleging Carey and Nick Cannon argued at Nickelodeon\\'s Kids\\' Choice Awards. And shortly before that bogus tale, we debunked the publication for wrongly claiming Carey and Lionel Richie were feuding over their joint tour. There was no truth to those stories, and the same goes for this one.    (Gossip Cop)',\n",
       " 'Madeleine Beth McCann (born 12 May 2003) disappeared on the evening of 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal, sparking what one newspaper called \"the most heavily reported missing-person case in modern history\".[3] Her whereabouts remain unknown.[4]  Madeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180 ft) away.[5] The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine\\'s mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal\\'s attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.[6][7]  The parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry, Operation Grange, in 2011. The senior investigating officer announced that he was treating the disappearance as \"a criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or burglary gone wrong.[8] In 2013, Scotland Yard released e-fit images of men they wanted to trace, including one of a man seen carrying a child toward the beach that night.[9] Shortly after this, the Portuguese police reopened their inquiry.[10] Operation Grange was scaled back in 2015, but the remaining detectives continued to pursue a small number of inquiries described in April 2017 as significant.[11]  The disappearance attracted sustained international interest and saturation coverage in the UK reminiscent of the death of Diana in 1997.[12] The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter\\'s death,[a] particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter.[16][17] In 2008 they and their travelling companions received damages and apologies from Express Newspapers,[18] and in 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.[19][20]  People  Madeleine McCann  Madeleine was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At her parents\\' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf.[21][22] Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye.[2][b] In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.[25][26]  Kate and Gerry McCann  Madeleine\\'s parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, née Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee. She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.[27]  Gerald Patrick McCann (born 1968 in Glasgow) attended Holyrood R.C. Secondary School before graduating from the University of Glasgow with a BSc in physiology/sports science in 1989. In 1992 he qualified in medicine and in 2002 obtained his MD, a research degree, also from Glasgow. Since 2005 he has been a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester.[28] The McCanns met in 1993 in Glasgow and were married in 1998. Madeleine was born in 2003 and the twins, a boy and girl, in 2005.[29]  Tapas Seven  The McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns\\' three.[30] The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort\\'s tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven.[31]  The group included Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona\\'s mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns had known the Paynes for years; Kate had met Fiona in 2000 when they both worked in Leicester General Hospital\\'s intensive care unit.[32] Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O\\'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.[33][31]  The \"Tanner sighting\"—Jane Tanner\\'s report that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing—became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case.[34]  5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, Praia da Luz  Waterside Village Ocean Club resort:  1: Tapas restaurant;  2: 5A\\'s front door;  3: Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins leading from 5A to Ocean Club door;  4: Stairs leading to 5A\\'s patio doors. 1: Tapas restaurant;2: 5A\\'s front door;3: Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins leading from 5A to Ocean Club door;4: Stairs leading to 5A\\'s patio doors.  The McCanns arrived on Saturday, 28 April 2007, for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz, a village with a population of 1,000, known as \"little Britain\" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers.[35] They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd, and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately owned properties rented by the company.[36]  5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner\\'s Ocean Club resort.[37] Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O\\'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor.[38]  The apartment block was not a gated complex. Located on the corner of Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides.[39] Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club\\'s pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A\\'s balcony and living room. 5A\\'s front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.[40][41]  The McCanns\\' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents\\' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street.[42] Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.[40]  Thursday, 3 May 2007  20:30: Tapas restaurant  Apartment 5A Side of 5A  showing steps from Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins to 5A\\'s patio doors showing steps from Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins to 5A\\'s patio doors Front (non-resort) side  on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva Madeleine\\'s bed (left);  window faces Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva Pink-and-white Eeyore pyjamas,  Madeleine\\'s clothing Madeleine\\'s clothing  Thursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family\\'s holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn\\'t you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children\\'s bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine\\'s pyjama top.[43]  The children spent the morning in the resort\\'s Kids\\' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool.[40] Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister.[44] The children returned to Kids\\' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson.[40] The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer\\'s Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.[45]  At 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club\\'s open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool.[46] 5A lay about 55 metres (160 ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295 ft).[5] The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.[46]  The resort\\'s staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group\\'s children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine\\'s mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.[47]  The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine\\'s father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children\\'s bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.[46]  21:15: Tanner sighting  [48] Artist\\'s impression of the man Jane Tanner saw, released October 2007; Scotland Yard believe it was this British tourist carrying his daughter.  The sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine\\'s father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker,[49] but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.[50]  Tanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A.[51] In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case\\'s first arguido.[54]  The child in the man\\'s arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine\\'s. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May.[55] Madeleine\\'s Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.[56][57]  The sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring.[48] In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche.[58] Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner\\'s report. Operation Grange\\'s lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were \"almost certain\" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.[48][59]  22:00: Smith sighting  The rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland.[60] Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine\\'s kidnap.[9][61]  The Smiths saw the man at around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (460 m) from the McCanns\\' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in–5 ft 9 in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child.[62][63] E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.[64]  22:00: Reported missing  Madeleine\\'s mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns\\' children\\'s bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.[40][65]  Kate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this.[66] Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children\\'s bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine\\'s Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming \"Madeleine\\'s gone! Someone\\'s taken her!\"[67]  At around 22:10 Madeleine\\'s father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort\\'s reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol.[68] Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4\\'s Dispatches that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.[69]  Early response  Portuguese police  Two officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8 km) away.[70] At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária, in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said they arrived just after 1 am.[71] According to the Polícia Judiciária, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted.[72] Two patrol dogs were brought to the resort at 2 am and four search-and-rescue dogs at 8 am.[73] Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins.[35][74] Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão, became the inquiry\\'s coordinator.[75]  It was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made during the so-called \"golden hours\" soon after the disappearance. Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches.[76][77] According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning.[62] Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information.[78] It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert.[62]  Not everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them.[77] The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one \"stranger\" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária.[79][50] According to Madeleine\\'s mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children\\'s bedroom, but left at 3 am without securing the apartment.[71] The Polícia Judiciária case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.[36][80]  A similar situation arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A, including next to the children\\'s bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window\\'s exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.[50]  British police  In the UK it was agreed that Madeleine\\'s home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry.[82] A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The Polícia Judiciária gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, information was collected in boxes. In addition the Polícia Judiciária had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates\\' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers\\' and Robbyn Swan\\'s book Looking for Madeleine (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\".[83]  Media and PR  Tribute in Madeleine\\'s home town of Rothley , 17 May 2007  A Polícia Judiciária officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the \"media circus\".[84] Gerry McCann told Vanity Fair in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public-relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive.[35] Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was apparently unprecedented.[85]  The first was Sheree Dodd, a former Daily Mirror journalist, then Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information.[86] On 15 May the McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund, a limited company, to raise money; its website attracted 58 million hits in the first two days.[87] The PR team arranged regular events to give the reporters a news peg. There was a visit to Fátima, where three children had reported a Marian apparition in 1917, as well as to Holland, Germany, Morocco and Spain. On 30 May, accompanied by reporters, the couple flew to Rome—in Sir Philip Green\\'s Learjet—to meet Pope Benedict XVI.[35] [c] The following month balloons were let off in 300 cities around the world.[90] From early June journalists began to voice concerns.[91] The \"sheer professionalism of it ... troubled journalists\", according to Matthew Parris.[92]  When the government withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major\\'s private secretary.[93][86] In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell\\'s salary so that he could return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine\\'s Fund.[3][94]  Placing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30,000 extra copies.[35] She appeared on the cover of People magazine on 28 May 2007,[95] on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months, and became one of Sky News\\'s menu options: \"UK News\", \"Madeleine\", \"World News\".[35][96][97] Between May 2007 and July 2008, the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã published 384 articles about her.[98] By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3,700 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube.[99]  First Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008)  First arguido  Twelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first arguido.[100][101] Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother\\'s house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked.[100] He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking a lot of questions about the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine\\'s age.[102][103]  Three members of the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O\\'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening.[106][107] The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCanns\\' supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, \"exclusive access to any new developments in the case\" if Bilton would report back what the press pack was saying about Murat.[108]  Beginning on 15 May, Murat\\'s home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned.[100][109] In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word fala (\"speak\") sprayed in red on the pavement.[110]  There was nothing to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat\\'s arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived.[6] In April 2008 he received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each.[111] In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard.[112] In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others.[113] In 2017 Murat\\'s mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.[114]  Witness statements  In statements to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.[48][115]  Several witnesses reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time.[116] On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street.[117] Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A.[117] At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.  An \"ugly\" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete,[120] and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A\\'s former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, \"ugly\" with spots.[120][121] On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns\\' apartment block, where a white van was parked.[121]  In the late afternoon of 3 May, the niece of the woman who lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt\\'s balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands.[122] At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns\\' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.[123]  McCanns as arguidos  Early suspicion  Praia da Luz, July 2009  The first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance.[124][125] On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in Sol, a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements, and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented.[126][127] The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens\\' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak.[49][125][128]  This and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were \"swingers\", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a \"pact of silence\" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance.[102] Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns\\' and Tapas Seven\\'s statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.[65][102]  Among the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back.[129] (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.)[46] There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked.[129] Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children\\'s bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.[50]  The Polícia Judiciária questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the tapas restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A\\'s rear balcony.[130]  Bedroom shutter Officer dusts children\\'s bedroom shutter  without protective clothing.[50] without protective clothing. —The Daily Telegraph  Another issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine\\'s bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside.[132] Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.  The apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction.[133] Kate\\'s shout of \"they\\'ve taken her\" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story.[50] Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance.[4][135] In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC Panorama that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.[136]  Portugal sends a letter rogatory  Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz, where the McCanns attended Mass  On 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the Polícia Judiciária that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites.[50] On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\".[137] Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel\\'s claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.[138][50][139]  The officer in charge of the Polícia Judiciária inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate\\'s support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to \"disclose the location of her daughter\\'s body\" without compromising herself.[140]  With this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a letter rogatory to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine\\'s body.[50][139] In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter.[141] His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel\\'s ideas as \"highly unlikely\". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat\\'s property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven\\'s apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.[142][141]  British sniffer dogs arrive  External image Eddie, the CSI dog, with Martin Grime — Ross Parry Agency  Keela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position. Eddie was a cadaver dog or enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason.[143]  The dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July 2007, and were taken to apartment 5A, nearby wasteland, and the beach. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom.[145] There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns\\' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend\\'s Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible\\'s owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes. A source close to the McCanns\\' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate\\'s clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.[150]  The police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance,[151] and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns\\' and Robert Murat\\'s. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns\\' car by the driver\\'s door.[145] The next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver\\'s side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver\\'s door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park.[154] Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.[155]  British DNA analysis  Hair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007.[156] At this point, according to the Sunday Times, the Polícia Judiciária \"abandoned the abduction theory\".[50] On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, Polícia Judiciária regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry.[157] When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, The Daily Telegraph identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns.[158] Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate\\'s memory was faulty.[157]  The FSS used a technique known as low copy number (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation.[159] On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine\\'s DNA components, and that the result was \"too complex for meaningful interpretation\":  A complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section ... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart. ... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion. ... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.[d]  McCanns made arguidos  The Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave.[162] Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September,[163] and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine\\'s DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A.[164] Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.[165]  The DNA evidence was a \"100 percent match\", journalists in Portugal were told.[166] British tabloid headlines included \"Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie\\'s\" (The Sun, 11 September 2007) and \"Corpse in McCann Car\" (London Evening Standard, 16 October 2007), while the Daily Star reported that a \"clump of Maddie\\'s hair\" had been found in the car.[167] Jerry Lawton, a Daily Star reporter, told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police.[e]  Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire Police, the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force\\'s priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.[169][f]  McCanns return to the UK, Almeida report  Despite their arguido status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007.[173]  The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns\\' statements.[174][84] On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias.[175] Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate\\'s diary and Gerry\\'s laptop.[176] The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.[177]  In the UK Control Risks, a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents\\' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives.[178] According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so.[179] Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.[180]  On 28 September, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote of his British counterpart, Alexander Ellis: \"Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted [during a meeting on 21 September] that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively.\"[181][182]  Gonçalo Amaral\\'s removal, later developments  On 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry\\'s coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper Diário de Notícias that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.[75][183]  Amaral was himself an arguido in relation to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine\\'s disappearance, Amaral was made arguido, and a month later he was charged with making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11 km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother\\'s brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.[184]  Amaral was replaced by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the Polícia Judiciária. The team of detectives was expanded and a case review began.[185] On 29 November 2007 four members of the inquiry, including Francisco Corte-Real, vice-president of Portugal\\'s forensic crime service, were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the Forensic Science Service.[186]  The Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance.[187] The Polícia Judiciária planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate.[188] The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, on the day the couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television.[189] The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects.[190] As of May 2008 Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.[191]  Inquiry closed (21 July 2008)  On 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their arguido status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:  The case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases ... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened. ... The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.[6][7]  On 4 August Portugal\\'s Ministério Público released 17 case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings.[192][g] The files included a 58-page prosecutors\\' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\"[194] In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages.[195] Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann\\'s diary, which had been taken by the Polícia Judiciária in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, Correio da Manhã, despite a Portuguese judge\\'s ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed.[196] On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, News of the World, published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.[197][198]  Amaral\\'s book (24 July 2008)  The bad feeling between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, who had coordinated the investigation from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that, to cover it up, the McCanns had faked an abduction.[199] Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police were pursuing leads helpful only to the McCanns.[75] Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira (\"Maddie: The Truth of the Lie\"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz.[200][201] By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies[202] and by 2010 had been translated into six languages.[84] A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.[203]  The McCanns began a libel action against Amaral and his publisher in 2009.[204] Madeleine\\'s Fund covered the legal fees.[205][206] In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages; Amaral\\'s appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016.[204] A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or sales of the book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral\\'s freedom of expression.[207] The ban was reinstated in 2015 as part of the libel ruling, then lifted when Amaral\\'s appeal succeeded in 2016.[208][204] The McCanns appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal\\'s Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017. In their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008.[7][209] In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns\\' final appeal.[205]  Madeleine\\'s Fund  Raising money  The McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, 12 days after the disappearance.[211] Over 80 million people visited the fund\\'s Find Madeleine website in the three months after the disappearance.[35] From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy\\'s lawyer joined the fund\\'s board of directors.[212][213][214]  Appeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise.[215][216][h] Donations included £250,000 from the News of the World, £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney.[217] J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns.[218] The fund did not cover the couple\\'s legal costs arising from their status as arguidos,[219] but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns\\' mortgage payments, before they were made arguidos.[220]  A reward of £2.5 million was also offered, including from the News of the World, Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard.[221][12] In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 in the form of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively.[222][223] In 2011 Kate McCann\\'s book, Madeleine, was serialized by The Sun and The Sunday Times, both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million.[224][225] In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000.[226] As of February 2017 it had seven directors, including the McCanns.[227]  Private investigators  Madeleine\\'s Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks.[228] Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 to look into one sighting.[229][230][213]  One of the private investigators was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired on the recommendation of the head of Manchester\\'s Serious Crime Squad.[231] Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter.[232] Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008,[233] and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.[234]  Oakley International  In 2008 Madeleine\\'s Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months.[230][235][236][237] (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation.[238]) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.[230]  Exton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child near the McCanns\\' apartment that night. The Oakley team produced e-fits based on the Smiths\\' description. This was a sensitive issue, because in September 2007 Martin Smith had watched footage of the McCanns arriving in the UK from Portugal, and believed he recognized Gerry McCann as the man he had seen with the child in Praia da Luz. Smith came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry McCann in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.[61]  Exton submitted his report to Madeleine\\'s Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors.[61] The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011[239]—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.[61]  Scotland Yard released the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. After it had aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008.[61] In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) that they had not only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.[239][240]  Further police inquiries (2011–present)  Gamble report  The McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case.[241] Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble, then head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP).[158][242] By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a British inquiry.[158][243]  Delivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, Leicestershire police, the Metropolitan Police Service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the National Police Improvement Agency, Crimestoppers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.[242]  Gamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted \"to be seen to help\", he wrote, which had \"created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition\", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police.[242] He recommended renewed cooperation between the British and Portuguese, that all relevant information be exchanged between the police forces, that police perform an analysis of telephone calls made on the night of the disappearance, and that all leads be pursued, including those developed by private detectives.[244]  Operation Grange  In May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians.[245]  The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, The Sun.[224] On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann\\'s book, Madeleine, The Sun\\'s front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper\\'s petition that day.[246] On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of The Sun.[243] The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry.[247] Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.[248]  Operation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard\\'s Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell.[245] The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff.[249] When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall.[250] By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.[251]  The team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image,[252] and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four.[253] In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry;[254] another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year;[255] and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.[256]  Theories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off  DCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed.[8] There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows.[115][48]  In an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard\\'s Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the \"burglary gone wrong\" hypothesis, while adding that it is \"not entirely ruled out\". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: \"If we didn\\'t think they were significant, we wouldn\\'t be carrying on.\"[11][257] Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard is looking for a woman who was seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.[258]  Redwood said in 2013 that the disappearance \"on one reading of the evidence\", did look like a pre-planned abduction: \"That undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance.\"[115][48] Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself.[115] In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats.[259] In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC\\'s Crimewatch staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting.[260] Days after Crimewatch aired, Portugal\\'s attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.[10]  Another theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby.[261] This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.[262]  Tracking mobile phone calls  Using mobile-phone tracking techniques, police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries.[263] The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.[113][264]  Police also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.[265]  Holiday-home sexual assaults  Scotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010.[266] The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.[267]  Searches and interviews in Praia da Luz  In June 2014 Scotland Yard and the Polícia Judiciária, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found.[268] The following month, at Scotland Yard\\'s request, the Polícia Judiciária in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them.[257] One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance.[112][269] Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Polícia Judiciária, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard requested them: \"We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime.\"[270]  Eleven people, including three British, were interviewed in December. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions, including \"Did you kill Madeleine?\" and \"Where did you hide the body?\"[271] Robert Murat, his wife and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance.[264] They admitted having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.[113][272]  Other inquiries  In the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine\\'s parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz.[273] Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year.[274] Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.[275]  A man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing.[276] Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.[277] In June 2016 Operation Grange officers interviewed a victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse.[278] Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance.[279] His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.[280]  Tabloids and social media  \"Trial by media\"  Eilis O\\'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\".[16] Twitter, one year old when Madeleine went missing, was the source of much of the vitriol against the McCanns.[281] Allegations were spread by YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook posts, discussion boards, blogs and personal websites, as well as across traditional media.[282] Ten years after the disappearance, the McCann hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield.[283] Social media\\'s attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns\\' twins, and when Scotland Yard and Crimewatch staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal.[284] One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations, and the following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets.[285]  The couple\\'s status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down.[287] The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the \"monstering of the McCanns\".[288] They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges.[289] Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.[290]  Kate McCann\\'s appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the London Review of Books.[291] Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid Correio da Manhã cited sources complaining that she had not \"shed a single tear\".[293] Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public.[295] There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: \"How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?\"  In November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards.[20] The inquiry heard that the editor of the Daily Express, in particular, had become \"obsessed\" with the couple.[297] Express headlines included that Madeleine had been \"killed by sleeping pills\", \"Find body or McCanns will escape\", and \"\\'McCanns or a friend must be to blame\\'\", the latter based on an interview with a waiter.[298] \"Maddie \\'Sold\\' By Hard-Up McCanns\" ran a headline in the Daily Star, part of the Express group.[299] Lord Justice Leveson called the articles \"complete piffle\".[297] Roy Greenslade described them as \"no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\".[286]  Libel actions  In addition to the McCanns\\' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The Daily Express, Daily Star and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine\\'s Fund.[18] The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine\\'s Fund, along with an apology in the Daily Express.[223] The McCanns received £55,000 from The Sunday Times in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.[240]  Robert Murat received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in relation to 100 articles published by 11 newspapers—The Sun and News of the World (News International), Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star (Northern & Shell), Daily Mail, London Evening Standard and Metro (Associated Newspapers), Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Daily Record (Mirror Group Newspapers).[300] According to The Observer, it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue.[111] His two associates were each awarded $100,000, and all three received public apologies.[300] The British Sky Broadcasting Group, which owns Sky News, paid Murat undisclosed damages in 2008 and agreed that Sky News would host an apology on its website for 12 months.[301]  See also  Sources  Notes  ^ Panorama, 3 May 2017): \"Even on the first glance of what we looked at, and when we took the information back and ran it through our own understanding and, you know, verified sightings and accounts and statements, and all the rest of it, it was perfectly clear to us that the McCanns themselves had nothing at all to do with the actual disappearance.\"[13] Simon Foy, former head of homicide, Scotland Yard (BBC, 3 May 2017): \"Even on the first glance of what we looked at, and when we took the information back and ran it through our own understanding and, you know, verified sightings and accounts and statements, and all the rest of it, it was perfectly clear to us that the McCanns themselves had nothing at all to do with the actual disappearance.\" Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Panorama, 3 May 2017): \"There is no fact at this point or evidence that suggests they [the parents] were involved in Madeleine McCann\\'s disappearance.\"[13] Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Polícia Judiciária (BBC, 3 May 2017): \"There is no fact at this point or evidence that suggests they [the parents] were involved in Madeleine McCann\\'s disappearance.\" Mark Rowley, The Daily Telegraph, April 2017), when asked about the McCanns\\' involvement: \"[T]here\\'s no reason whatsoever to reopen that or to start rumours that that\\'s a line of investigation\".[11] Scotland Yard \\'s assistant commissioner (, April 2017), when asked about the McCanns\\' involvement: \"[T]here\\'s no reason whatsoever to reopen that or to start rumours that that\\'s a line of investigation\".

       " 'The 75th Golden Globe Awards officially kick awards season, but this year, the red carpet may create as much conversation as the honors handed out during the ceremony itself.  Last month, reports surfaced that some female actors planned to wear all-black looks on the Golden Globes red carpet to protest sexual misconduct in Hollywood. More recently, some men, including Dwayne Johnson, announced plans to join them. The protest comes after numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against men in Hollywood and other industries, beginning with those against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in October.  Stylist Cristina Ehrlich told TIME Friday that she would be joining the effort by dressing Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern in black.  “The red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration. Where in the past the red carpet has been about glitz and glamour, this year it isn’t about standing out, it’s about standing together and speaking out,” she said.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  The sartorial choice is being positioned as a way to call attention to the effort to end sexual misconduct. It’s organized by Time’s Up, a new initiative to eradicate sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, which includes the creation of a legal defense fund. Time’s Up, which has also provided pins to be worn on the red carpet, is backed by more than 300 women in the entertainment industry, including Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep.  This is not the first time stars have used fashion to start a conversation. Take, for example, the blue ACLU ribbons Karlie Kloss and Barry Jenkins, among others, wore to last year’s Oscars, or the Planned Parenthood pin Emma Stone sported while picking up her Best Actress statuette at the same ceremony.  TIME Person of the Year 2017: The Silence Breakers  This year’s red-carpet protest has been subject to some criticism, with some suggesting that sporting a dress in solidarity feels like a superficial or passive way to address a problem. Actor Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, sounded off on the protest in a now-deleted tweet: “YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You’ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.” (Marchesa is the high-end brand designed by Weinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman, who announced her separation from the producer shortly after the allegations came to light.)  Activist April Reign, who created the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, suggested that it might send a stronger message if the actors didn’t attend the Golden Globes at all.  In response to the debate, Actor Rashida Jones told InStyle that the choice to wear black dresses on the red carpet is hardly, in her estimation, a “silent protest.” Instead, she said, it’s an opportunity to speak up and demand structural change.  “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts,” she said. “Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black. We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.”  Write to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.',\n",

       " \"Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom. He and Kate Middleton are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, not the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.\",\n",

No further statements will be given.”  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time — he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with “Wake Me Up” and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes’ “Highest-Paid DJs” lists — he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio.  The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.”  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit “Seek Bromance,” which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as “the lowest level of Buddhist hell,” chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single “Levels,” which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. “Sunshine,” his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York’s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled “Stay with You.”  His proper debut album, “True,” was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album “Rebel Heart,” although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 “Saturday Night Live” digital short called “When Will the Bass Drop?,” with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named “Davvincii” (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem “We Will Find a Way.” Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay’s album “Ghost Stories.” He released his second full-length album, “Stories,” in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled “Avici,” which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called “True Stories,” which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he’s in obvious physical pain. “I looked at myself like, ‘F—, you should’ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'” he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. “Why didn’t I stop the ship earlier?”  “I needed to figure out my life,” he continued. “The whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn’t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That’s what I love the most – having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that’s invaluable.”  RELATED CONTENT  Musicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii  Avicii’s Biggest Hits (Listen)  ‘Avicii: True Stories’ Documentary Reveals Star DJ’s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement  Avicii’s Life and Career in Photos  POPULAR ON VARIETY\",\n",
       " \"Meghan Markle’s nephew has announced details of the special strain of cannabis he has created to celebrate the upcoming royal wedding.  Tyler Dooley grows cannabis in Oregon, US – which has been legal in the American state since 2015 – and previously announced that he would be developing a new potent hybrid named Markle’s Sparkle.  Now, days before Markle is due to marry Prince Harry, details of the drug’s price, flavour and effects have been released on Leaf Buyer – an online cannabis dispensary database.  In an online description of Markle Sparkle, the website says: “Noble families often inspire their country persons to craft and dedicate products to them.  “For a Royal baby, a royal cheddar. For a Royal wedding, a royal weed.  “Markle Sparkle is a cannabis strain dedicated to the soon-to-be British Royal Meghan Markle.”  The $150-an-ounce (£111) strain is tipped to be good for helping alleviate insomnia, pain and anxiety, and it has been specially engineered so that it doesn’t make users feel too hungry.  The website also says that Markle Sparkle has a “very sweet, silky taste” with “notes of fresh blueberry and a unique, fruity and smooth flavour.”  As for its effect, the drug is supposed to provide users with an “uplifting” experience and a “tingling body sensation.”  “There is a sense of relief and euphoria that comes with the high as well,” it says.  “These benefits make for a great all-around versatile strain for any medical patient or recreational consumer.”  The Markle Sparkle tests at 23 per cent THC - the active ingredient in marijuana – and is made by crossbreeding three varieties including NYC Diesel, Northern Lights with Blueberry and a secret strain which Dooley is not revealing.

Royally Grown is also selling edibles like Markle Sparkle-infused brownies, oils and tinctures, as well as makeup, jewellery, bath products and an organic hemp clothing line.  According to the Daily Mail, the new drug has already won the praise of marijuana industry newspaper High Times.  Its spokesman Jon Cappetta has said: “If the quality of the strain matches the hype over its name, Markle Sparkle has the potential to be very lucrative.  “Title strains like Blue Dream, Sour Diesel, or OG Kush are sought out by name across the world, and in turn can command higher rates.  “These are decades old strains we're talking about. If this hits in the way they are hoping, it will not only make money for years to come, it actually has the potential to outlast the marriage.”\",\n",
       " 'Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that Hollywood elites killed his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child’s mother, Selena Gomez, as a way of punishing him.  Since finding God last year, Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Wednesday he shared what he called “the worst moment in my life” with the congregation and explained why he had to retire from the music industry.  Telling churchgoers that he will “never go back” to the “evil music industry” until the “pedophiles and monsters at the top of the game are run out of town” and everything is “disinfected with bleach and sunshine,” Bieber explained how Hollywood elites tried to corrupt him.  “They tried so hard to corrupt me,” Bieber said, “because I reached a level they couldn’t control anymore.”  “They tried to destroy me with alcohol and when that didn’t work they tried with drugs – all different kinds. Then when that didn’t work they tried to destroy me with ambition.”  “I was interested at first,” Bieber acknowledged, before saying “but when I realized what the price of admission is in that world, I had to quit.”  “Selena and I were expecting. It was early days and we hadn’t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.”  Describing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.  “The baby’s entire scalp wasn’t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away. You could see bite marks and bruises all over its tiny body.”  “They were wearing animal masks, sitting around drinking what they called ‘red wine.’ They offered me some. It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.  “I literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.”  “When he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.”  The horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called “exsanguination”, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call “red wine” in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.  They believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more “enriched” its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.  Bieber refused to drink the blood and that is when “everything started going wrong.”  “They threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.”  “This completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,” said Bieber, fighting back tears. “They murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena… we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.”  But years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.  “They won’t lay a hand on my family so help me God,” he said.  “There are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,” Bieber said, before exiting the stand.  These latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan have spoken out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. As more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.',\n",

As a longtime member of the E! family, it’s exciting to welcome her back home to ‘E! News,’” said John Najarian, executive vice president and general manager of news and digital for E!. “While ‘E!

She will return to the show on Sept. 4, where she will join co-host Jason Kennedy.

She will continue as co-host of E!’s “Live From the Red Carpet” after her return to “E! News.”  “Returning to host ‘E!

But more recently, E! host Catt Sadler departed after she says she learned of a substantial pay gap between herself and Kennedy. E! disputed Sadler’s claims, saying that she and Kennedy had “different roles,” with Sadler focused on daytime while Kennedy worked in primetime and did red carpet coverage.',\n",
       " 'Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux shocked the world when they announced their split in February 2018. After seven years as a couple and two and a half years of marriage, we thought they finally got their happy ending.  Although they promised to “[continue] their cherished friendship” in the separation statement they released, we’re not so sure that’s the case anymore. Dark secrets have been revealed surrounding their divorce, including what they’re fighting over (page 6) and why Theroux’s rumored relationship with Selena Gomez is so messed up (page 8).  1. There were warning signs of their divorce  The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images The warning signs were there. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Looking back, maybe Aniston and Theroux’s divorce isn’t so surprising after all. As it turns out, there were some obvious warning signs leading up to their announcement.  Aniston was attending parties left and right without her husband, from her Friends co-star Courtney Cox’s birthday celebration in Malibu to Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding.  Theroux didn’t post any birthday wishes to Aniston on Feb. 11, 2018 — just four days before their separation announcement — whereas they’d typically share sweet messages on each other’s birthday.  Next: It’s been going on for a while.  2. They went through ‘intense issues’ for almost a year  Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images Their last year together wasn’t a happy one. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images  According to E!

A source revealed that by the time of their split, they’d actually “been separated for two months.”  However, they “were having intense issues for about eight months.”  Next: They may not have ever been meant to be.  3. Their lifestyles were completely different  She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images She couldn’t live the low-key life he wanted. |Jean Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images  Aniston and Theroux seemed perfect for each other, but their lifestyles just weren’t compatible. E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn’t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.  A source confirmed, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”    The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This played a major role in their split.  4.

Theroux, however, was unsurprisingly upset upon finding her keepsake collection.  A source told Us Weekly that when Theroux “stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” the impact was “huge.”  “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already,’” were among the love notes Theroux uncovered. His discovery left him with insecurities, which could have ultimately played a huge part in their split.  Next: They’ve been fighting over this since their split.  6.

       " 'Cam Newton’s sexist comment to a female reporter has cost the Carolina Panthers quarterback a side gig as a yogurt pitchman amid national backlash.  Dannon, the maker of Oikos yogurt, has dropped Newton from all advertising campaigns following what the company perceives as “sexist” remarks he made on Wednesday to Jourdan Rodrigue, a beat reporter with the Charlotte Observer.  Cam Newton disses female reporter with sexist remark at press conference Read more  Company spokesperson Michael Neuwirth released a statement Thursday saying it was “shocked and disheartened” at the former league MVP’s behavior.  Newton made light of a straightforward question from Rodrigue during his regular media availability on Wednesday, saying it was “funny to hear a female” ask about football.  The 28-year-old quarterback, who smirked derisively as the reporter asked about Carolina wide receiver Devin Funchess’s route-running, prefaced his response with a dig: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes. It’s funny.”  The Dannon statement noted the company perceives Newton’s comments as “sexist and disparaging to all women. It’s simply not OK to belittle anyone based on gender. We have shared our concerns with Cam and will no longer work with him.”  Carlin & Reese (@CarlinReeseWIP) Here\\'s the video of Cam Newton saying \"it\\'s funny to hear a female talk about routes\" pic.twitter.com/hd9Kg4CCeu  The company later clarified: “The agreement has not been terminated. However, we will no longer work with him and are removing advertising with him in it.”  Later Thursday, Newton apologized in a video posted to Twitter for what he described as an “extremely degrading and disrespectful” choice of words.  “After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” he said. “And to be honest, that was not my intention. If you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.  “I’m a man who tries to be a positive role model to my community and tries to use my platform to inspire others. I take ownership to everything that comes with that. What I did was extremely unacceptable.”  Dannon inked Newton to sponsor its Oikos brand of Greek yogurt in January 2015, shortly after the quarterback’s maiden playoff victory.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Newton has sponsored Dannon’s Oikos yogurt since 2015.  By the end of that year, one that saw the quarterback capture MVP honors while leading the Panthers to Super Bowl 50, Newton had become one of the NFL’s most visible pitchmen with an endorsement portfolio including pacts with Gatorade, Under Armour, Beats By Dre, Nickelodeon, Carolina Health Systems and Belk worth an estimated $11m combined.  Gatorade also issued a statement Thursday, saying: “Cam’s comments were objectionable and disrespectful to all women and they do not reflect the values of our brand. Gatorade fully supports women who compete in, report on, coach for, or play any role in sport – on or off the field.”  The NFL added in another statement that Newton’s response to the question was “just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.”  Cam Newton\\'s joyful Panthers remind us that football can still be fun Read more  But it doesn’t appear there will be any punishment handed out to Newton.  “I think there are conversations going on at the club level with the appropriate people, with the Panthers,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a conference call Thursday. “I don’t want to anticipate the league stepping in there.”  Mike Persinger, the executive sports editor of the Observer, said Wednesday evening that Newton’s comments were “unfortunate and out of line.”  The Associated Press Sports Editors announced that it “agrees wholeheartedly that Mr Newton’s response was out of line” and “we ask for a formal apology to Jourdan Rodrigue from Mr Newton and the Carolina Panthers organization.”    The Newton hubbub inadvertently prompted a separate controversy after three tweets Rodrigue posted years ago with racial overtones were discovered by Black Sports Online. The reporter used the word “nigga” in one of the tweets and referenced laughing at racist jokes in the others.  “I apologize for the offensive tweets from my Twitter account from 4/5 years ago,” Rodrigue said on Thursday. “There is no excuse for these tweets and the sentiment behind them. I am deeply sorry and apologize.”    Newton, who slumped badly last season after his spectacular MVP campaign in 2015, has passed for 882 yards with five touchdowns and five interceptions in four games this year, leading the Panthers to a 3-1 record and a tie for first place in the NFC South.',\n",

The first season dropped in July 2016, but Netflix had commissioned the second before it even landed. Season two was timed to coincide with Halloween, and came out in late October 2017. The third season didn\\'t start filming until spring 2018 and it was reported that we would be waiting until 2019 to see it.  And it was then seemingly confirmed in a teaser that we would be getting new episodes in summer 2019.    Cindy Holland, Netflix\\'s VP of original content, explained that the delay has been because it\\'s a \"handcrafted show\". \"They want to deliver something bigger and better than what they did last year. And so they really want to take the time to get it right,\" Holland added.  But how many episodes are we getting to binge? Back in January 2018, Levy revealed that this would be an eight or nine episode season.  \"The number of episodes will be dictated by the amount of story that excites us. We now know what is going to happen in season three to every character,\" he confirmed.  Reports surfaced in February that the new season would indeed run to eight episodes (one less than the previous run), which was officially confirmed in April. As with the previous two seasons, the Duffer Brothers will direct the first two episodes, with Levy directing the third and the fourth.

Ferguson was promoted to main cast status in March 2018. Matt Duffer told Yahoo!: \"I love Erica. [Priah] was just a local hire we made in Atlanta. Erica wasn\\'t even supposed to be in [season two] as much as she was. We fell in love with this girl. I thought she\\'s very GIF-able, if that\\'s a word.\"  Another, less well-loved, character is strongly tipped to return: Eleven\\'s \"lost\" sister Kali, aka 008. \"It feels weird to me that we wouldn\\'t solve [Kali\\'s] storyline,\" Matt Duffer told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I would say chances are very high she comes back.\" So… Yay?

It\\'s important to remember, however, that Stranger Things released a similar teaser ahead of season two and a few of those episode titles had changed by the time the finished product hit Netflix, so the above might not be definitive.  The Duffers have confirmed that, as with season two, there will be a time jump of one year between seasons two and three. Matt Duffer told The Hollywood Reporter: \"Even if we wanted to hop into the action faster, we couldn\\'t. Our kids are ageing.  \"We can only write and produce the show so fast. They\\'re going to be almost a year older by the time we start shooting season three. It provides certain challenges. You can\\'t start right after season two ended.  \"It forces you to do a time jump. But what I like is that it makes you evolve the show.\"  \"It\\'s always about a year later,\" said Natalia Dyer (Nancy). \"So [just thinking] about what\\'s gone on this year, like \\'Where are we?\\'. Just seeing how the characters have grown in the meantime.... I get really excited about that story and where everyone\\'s been.\"  \"Season 3 is set in the summer, so right out of the gate that\\'s a big difference,\" Levy confirmed.  Netflix  \"The first two seasons were very much school-based. This is that time of year where it\\'s not about school, it\\'s about the swimming pool and campfires and parades and Fourth of July and fireworks, so there\\'s kind of a poppy fun to season 3 that\\'s really enjoyable before things inevitably turn super dark.\"  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Talking up that light / dark contrast again, Ross Duffer has described season 3 as both the \"most fun\" yet, but also \"the grossest\" – citing influences ranging from John Carpenter\\'s The Thing to David Cronenberg movies to George Romero zombie flicks.  \"There are horror movies and horror masters that we haven\\'t really paid tribute to as much in previous seasons that we are definitely going to get into this season,\" he said.  Ross has also, somewhat upsettingly, described the third season as \"the final summer of [the central gang\\'s] childhood. They\\'re dealing with growing up, with these complicated new relationships.  \"They\\'re starting to fall apart a little bit, and maybe they don\\'t love playing Dungeons & Dragons as much as they used to. Naturally, that\\'s going to generate conflict.\"  After that final shot of season two, we\\'ll definitely see the Mind Flayer / Shadow Monster again, though he\\'s done with the demo-dogs and will be exploring \"some new strategies.\"  \"We ended season two with a clear signal that the Shadow Monster was not eliminated, and maybe he\\'s even identified his foe,\" said Levy. \"And that darkness, and the battle that it will require, grows in season three.\"  Related: Stranger Things team reveal secrets of the Shadow Monster in extract from new official companion book  Season three will further explore the mythology of the Upside Down, but don\\'t expect clear answers.  Ross Duffer says: \"There\\'s no way [the kids] can ever truly fully understand this place. We have our Upside Down document which describes its rules and its mythology in quite a bit of detail, but I think we\\'re just going to slowly parse that out, and maybe not even fully use all of it.

Ross said: \"I love the early days of seasons, because you are filled with all of these possibilities. We are having a lot of fun just bouncing around cool ideas.\"  Matt hinted that the next season will focus more on character development than scale: \"It\\'s not necessarily going to be bigger in scale. What I am really excited about is giving these characters an interesting journey to go on.\"  Rather confusingly, though, Natalia Dyer later suggested that this season \"feels very... big. I mean they all feel big, but this one feels maybe the biggest so far.\"  Big, but also small? Sounds pretty Upside Down to us.  Netflix  Related: Stranger Things season 3\\'s Chief Hopper aka David Harbour has a bold new look  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  David Harbour has also hinted at exploring some more of Hopper\\'s backstory: \"We\\'ve also seen a lot of things, when Eleven goes down to his cellar and sees the boxes, we see a box that says Dad, a box that says New York, a box that says Vietnam. These are little Easter eggs for Jim, further layers of the onion that can be peeled back. \"More will be revealed on that front.\"  Harbour also revealed a nugget or two that suggest his daughter Sara\\'s history will be further explored in later seasons. Like the stuffed tiger toy that appears in Eleven\\'s room, Will\\'s castle and Sara\\'s hospital room. Did Sara come into contact with the Upside-Down?  Netflix  He\\'s also been talking up his character\\'s potential romance with Joyce Byers by saying that they\\'re \"built for each other\", while adding that we\\'ll see a different side to Hopper now that he\\'s adopted Eleven as his daughter.  \"What\\'s he like when there are no crimes, and when he\\'s just raising a teenage daughter who\\'s becoming a woman — I think it is probably the greatest challenge for him,\" Harbour outlined. \"It is probably much more terrifying than any Demogorgon could possibly be.\"  And speaking of father figures, we\\'ll get to see a lot more of Steve (Joe Keery) acting as a mentor to Dustin and the other kids. \"I\\'ll just say we won\\'t be abandoning the Dad Steve magic,\" hinted Shawn Levy.

Netflix  \"I don\\'t know, I don\\'t want to speculate too much. I feel like the Duffers [co-creators Matt and Ross Duffer] are so great, that they\\'re going to have all kind of things up their sleeves. I\\'m excited to see where it goes.\"  Millie Bobby Brown has got a pretty dark idea for how she wants season three to go for Eleven as she wants her to \"sacrifice herself in some way\".  \"I want to have her really sacrifice her powers. If Eleven loses her powers, is she as powerful just as a character? I think that would be very cool,\" she explained. \"I want to build her to be a strong person without her powers... But right now it\\'s very about her powers and I think taking that away slowly could be cool.\"  Fortunately for Schnapp, Will is going to be given a break in the new season. \"We\\'re not going to put Will through hell for a third season in a row. He\\'ll be dealing with stuff, but he won\\'t be at rock bottom the way we forced the amazing Noah Schnapp to play,\" Levy outlined.  But it won\\'t be plain sailing for the children as Levy also noted that there will be \"forces of evil that are new\" in season three, even if there will be \"plenty of summer fun AND light\" so that\\'s nice.

After pleading guilty to repeatedly violating the protective order, the stalker was sentenced on Monday to a 10-year probation, according to TMZ , but there are many legal strings attached to make sure that he can no longer harass Taylor.

Despite rumors of a split or the couple taking a break, a source tells ET that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are \"still together.\"    While they often spend time apart, the source explains that distance between them is generally for \"various reasons,\" saying, \"It\\'s not because they are broken up or taking a break.\"    In fact, both Gomez and Bieber were seen leaving church together in Los Angeles on Wednesday night, albeit in separate vehicles.

According to the source, that conflict continues to play a part in her relationship with Bieber.  \"It\\'s not easy for Selena to be stuck in the middle,” the source says. \"Her family not liking him is the biggest issue -- but if they can get through that or if her family changes their tune, things will be a lot smoother.\"  Despite the drama, the singer publicly acknowledged her rekindled romance with Bieber for the first time last week on his 24th birthday. \"March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born.

       " 'Trace Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea on the series, is the second accuser to allege misconduct by the show\\'s star; Amazon says the new information \"will be added to our ongoing investigation.\"  In the second season of Transparent, the groundbreaking Amazon series that traces one father\\'s journey to womanhood, Maura Pfefferman — played by Jeffrey Tambor, in a role that has won him two Emmys — struggles to find the right inflection for the popular queer catchphrase, \"Yas queen.\"  Her teacher is Shea — played by Trace Lysette — a yoga teacher and sometimes stripper, who steps in to show her fellow transgender, a newbie, the ropes.  The moment, which went viral shortly after the season debuted in November 2015, plays out as sweet, hilarious and authentic. But Lysette now says the circumstances around its filming were anything but.  According to Lysette, when she emerged from wardrobe in her costume — a salmon-colored lingerie top and matching short-shorts — Tambor remarked, \"My God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually.\" Alexandra Billings, the third actor in the scene, was present to hear the remark, she confirms. Both \"laughed it off because it was so absurd,\" Lysette says.  A few minutes later, while waiting for a camera setup between takes, Lysette was standing in a corner of the soundstage set. That\\'s when she says Tambor, dressed as Maura, wearing a green satin kimono and gray wig, approached her.  \"He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas,\" Lysette says.  Lysette pushed Tambor away and \"rolled my eyes.\" Billings was not present for this alleged incident, and several crewmembers were nearby \"but they were focused on their jobs. It was discreet. If you were behind Jeffrey you might have thought he was giving me a hug.\"  The actress, who is transgender, is the second on the Transparent payroll to come forward with allegations that Tambor, 73, has subjected them to sexual harassment, sexual assault and generally abusive behavior on the set of the critically adored series.  The first accuser, Van Barnes, is a trans woman who worked as Tambor\\'s personal assistant, and whose allegations have led to an internal investigation by Amazon Studios. She has previously appeared on E!\\'s I Am Cait.  According to Barnes\\' lawyer Alana Chazan, her client signed a nondisclosure agreement while working for Tambor and therefore could not comment on Lysette\\'s claims. Nor would Barnes detail what workplace abuses she allegedly suffered at Tambor\\'s hands — accusations which were made in a private Facebook post that had leaked and circulated within Hollywood transgender circles.  A copy of that Facebook post was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. In it, Barnes, without directly naming Tambor, vents about an employer who made comments like \"I should be sleeping with him if I want a Hollywood industry appropriate pay grade\" and \"it wouldn\\'t take long, he pops quick.\" She says the employer subjected her to \"butt pats,\" pornography played at loud volumes, and complaints that she \"was useless, could do nothing right.\"  \"Despite having made no public statements to date, the disclosure of Van Barnes\\' identity by the press has already led to Ms. Barnes receiving numerous threats and harassment online,\" Chazan says. \"Ms. Barnes is cooperating with the investigation being conducted by Amazon and will not be making a statement while the investigation is pending.\"  Lysette shared a house with Barnes while Barnes worked as Tambor\\'s assistant. \"She would pick him up in the morning and bring him home at night and everything in between,\" Lysette recalls. \"She would come home wrecked and stressed. I saw him break her down. She for the most part kept it to herself. She was just like, \\'Girl, he is a piece of work. If you only knew what I’m going through.\\' But I knew.\"  For Lysette, an acting neophyte who came to Hollywood directly from New York City, where she worked as a dancer, Tambor\\'s attentions began early and innocently enough.  She describes a moment in her first season on the show, a scene set in a yoga studio, when she had trouble finding her mark. \"Jeffrey stepped in and said, \\'Come on, that’s hard. I couldn’t even do that.\\' And then he and the [director of photography] had a little back and forth. He was sticking up for me.\"  When the exchange was over, Tambor approached Lysette and \"kissed me on the forehead and was like, \\'Are you good?\\' I said, \\'Yeah, I’m fine.\\' It started with things like that. Telling me I looked great, things like that.\"  As Lysette began to step into the spotlight and enjoy her first tastes of fame, she recalls running into Tambor at red carpet events, where she \"would go to hug him and kiss him on the cheek — and it would land on my lips. And I was like, \\'OK. What was that about?\\'\"  She says it wasn\\'t until the filming of the \"yas queen\" scene and the alleged physical assault that she was certain she was being targeted and sexually harassed by Tambor. From that moment on, she says life on the set with the actor \"has been a roller coaster. One minute Jeffrey is lovely, the next it\\'s a temper tantrum or flirtation.\"  Lysette describes another moment \"that sticks in my brain\" from later in production of season two: Tambor had set up a meeting between Lysette and his manager for potential representation.  Lysette thanked Tambor for the gesture, she says, \"and he said, \\'Well, yeah Trace. I really believe in you. And you know what? I don\\'t even want to have sex with you.\\' And then he just looked at me as if he very much indeed wanted to have sex with me. It was an up-and-down look. I rolled my eyes and went to my trailer and thought, \\'This man is something else.\\'\"  Both Lysette and Barnes say they approached Transparent producers with their complaints about Tambor, but no action was taken.  Tambor issued this statement to THR in response to Lysette\\'s allegations:  For the past four years, I’ve had the huge privilege — and huge responsibility — of playing Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman, in a show that I know has had an enormous, positive impact on a community that has been too long dismissed and misunderstood. Now I find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly. I know I haven’t always been the easiest person to work with. I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator — ever. I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express.  An Amazon spokesperson says, \"This information will be added to our ongoing conversation.\"  Lysette issued this statement to THR:  Last week, it was reported in the media that Van Barnes, who previously worked as Jeffrey Tambor\\'s assistant while shooting Transparent, had privately spoken out on her social media about her experiences of abuse. Sadly, I must add my voice to the chorus. Jeffrey has acted inappropriate to me too.  Jeffrey has made many sexual advances and comments at me, but one time it got physical.  One day on set during Season 2, Jeffrey, Alexandra Billings and I were all outfitted in pajamas. I was in a flimsy top and matching short shorts. Upon seeing my in my costume, Jeffrey sexualized me with an over the top comment. Alexandra and I laughed it off because it was so absurd and we thought surely it had to be a bad joke. I shook it off. Then later, in between takes, I stood in a corner on the set as the crew reset for a wide shot. My back was against the wall in a corner as Jeffrey approached me. He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrusts back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas and I pushed him off of me. Again, I laughed it off and rolled my eyes. I had a job to do and I had to do it with Jeffrey, the lead of our show. When they called action, I put that moment in the corner into its own corner of my mind. Compartmentalizing has always been part of my survival took kit, long before I came to Hollywood. It\\'s shitty to admit out loud — and I don\\'t say it to justify what I went through — but given the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men — this one just happened to be famous.  Despite multiple uncomfortable experiences with Jeffrey, it has been an incredible, career-solidifying honor to bring life to my character Shea on Amazon\\'s Transparent. Working on the award-winning series as a low-income trans woman with active roots in New York\\'s ball culture is a rare opportunity most of my sisters are not given.  My hope is that Amazon can find the good in this, and use this as an opportunity, a teachable moment to re-center the other trans characters in this show with the family members instead of just pulling it. Let our brilliant writers continue to craft something that is entertaining and creates a social change the way they know how. Don\\'t let the trans community suffer for the actions of one cis male actor. Transparent has been a guiding light in the industry, by employing more trans people in Hollywood than any other production in history, which made it even more difficult to speak out. As trans-women and survivors we have often felt we never had the power of the voice to speak out on our personal and collective pain. I am so proud of my work on Transparent and its \"trans-affirmative action\" mission, as coined by its creator Jill Soloway. And I call on Amazon to make another bold affirmative move to our communities: Remove the problem and let the show go on. It\\'s vital that the show\\'s creator, showrunner and its studio re-center the narrative of Transparent on the experiences of the other trans characters and family members audiences have grown to love on the series.',\n",
       " 'Serena Williams will soon show an intimate side of her life to fans.  On May 2, HBO will premiere “Being Serena,” a five-part documentary series about the tennis superstar that will not only delve into Williams’ career, but will also chronicle her 2017 marriage to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and the birth of her first child, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.  Williams has spoken about complications she faced throughout her pregnancy, revealing that she almost died after giving birth to her daughter. The new series takes a deeper dive into what really went on, as well as into Williams’ journey back to the tennis court.  Tim Clayton - Corbis via Getty Images \"Being Serena,\" a new five-part HBO series about tennis superstar Serena Williams, premieres on May 2.  “When I realized that I was pregnant I was like, ‘Oh my God. How am I going to play?’” Williams says in the “Being Serena” teaser, exclusively premiering on HuffPost. “I put so much pressure on myself. I want to make sure that I’m the best.”  A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Mar 26, 2018 at 7:55am PDT  “Being Serena” also touches on Williams’ life as a businesswoman and investor in technology, fashion, fitness and philanthropy.  “HBO is honored to work with Serena Williams on such a personal project,” Peter Nelson, executive vice president, HBO Sports, said in a statement. “Even though she has been in the spotlight since her teenage years, Serena continues to capture the imagination.”  At 36, Williams has had quite the career, with 39 Grand Slam titles and four Olympic Gold Medals. She’s won the most women’s singles match victories in Grand Slam history.  Williams returned to the court last week to compete for one of the first times since her 13-month break. After losing to Naomi Osaka in the first round of the Miami Open on Wednesday, she released a statement saying, “Every tournament is an opportunity for me to better understand the areas I need to improve to be my best. Naomi played a great match and I learn something each time I play. I look forward to continuing my return by progressing every day. I’m so grateful for my fans who continue to support me every step of this incredible journey.”  She also posted this photo on Instagram with an inspirational caption, alluding to the complications she suffered during ― and after ― the birth of her daughter.  A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Mar 22, 2018 at 5:45am PDT  Williams is clearly committed to staying in the game.  “I don’t know if there’s anything left for me in tennis,” she says in the documentary. “But I’m not done yet.”  The first episode of “Being Serena,” produced as a partnership with IMG’s Original Content Group, debuts on HBO May 2 at 10 p.m. The remaining installments will air subsequent Wednesdays at the same time.',\n",
